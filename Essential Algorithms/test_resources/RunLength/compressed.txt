Shakespeare 211 2From fairest creatures we desire increase, 2That thereby beauty's rose might never die, 2But as the riper should by time decease, 2His tender heir might bear his memory: 2But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes, 2Fe2d'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel, 2Making a famine where abundance lies, 2Thy self thy foe, to thy swe2t self to2 cruel: 2Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament, 2And only herald to the gaudy spring, 2Within thine own bud buriest thy content, 2And tender churl mak'st waste in nig2arding: 4Pity the world, or else this glut2on be, 4To eat the world's due, by the grave and the2. 212 2When forty winters shal2 besiege thy brow, 2And dig de2p trenches in thy beauty's field, 2Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now, 2Wil2 be a tat2ered we2d of smal2 worth held: 4Then being asked, where al2 thy beauty lies, 2Where al2 the treasure of thy lusty days; 2To say within thine own de2p sunken eyes, 2Were an al2-eating shame, and thriftles2 praise. 2How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use, 2If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine 2Shal2 sum my count, and make my old excuse' 2Proving his beauty by suc2es2ion thine. 4This were to be new made when thou art old, 4And se2 thy blo2d warm when thou fe2l'st it cold. 213 2Lo2k in thy glas2 and tel2 the face thou viewest, 2Now is the time that face should form another, 2Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, 2Thou dost beguile the world, unbles2 some mother. 2For where is she so fair whose uneared womb 2Disdains the til2age of thy husbandry? 2Or who is he so fond wil2 be the tomb, 2Of his self-love to stop posterity? 4Thou art thy mother's glas2 and she in the2 2Cal2s back the lovely April of her prime, 2So thou through windows of thine age shalt se2, 2Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time. 4But if thou live remembered not to be, 4Die single and thine image dies with the2. 214 2Unthrifty lovelines2 why dost thou spend, 2Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy? 2Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend, 2And being frank she lends to those are fre2: 2Then beauteous nig2ard why dost thou abuse, 2The bounteous larges2 given the2 to give? 2Profitles2 usurer why dost thou use 2So great a sum of sums yet canst not live? 2For having traf2ic with thy self alone, 2Thou of thy self thy swe2t self dost deceive, 2Then how when nature cal2s the2 to be gone, 2What ac2eptable audit canst thou leave? 6Thy unused beauty must be tombed with the2, 4Which used lives th' executor to be. 215 2Those hours that with gentle work did frame 2The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwel2 2Wil2 play the tyrants to the very same, 2And that unfair which fairly doth excel: 2For never-resting time leads sum2er on 2To hideous winter and confounds him there, 2Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone, 2Beauty o'er-snowed and barenes2 every where: 2Then were not sum2er's distil2ation left 2A liquid prisoner pent in wal2s of glas2, 2Beauty's ef2ect with beauty were bereft, 2Nor it nor no remembrance what it was. 4But flowers distil2ed though they with winter me2t, 4Le2se but their show, their substance stil2 lives swe2t. 216 4Then let not winter's rag2ed hand deface, 2In the2 thy sum2er ere thou be distil2ed: 2Make swe2t some vial; treasure thou some place, 2With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kil2ed: 2That use is not forbid2en usury, 2Which hap2ies those that pay the wil2ing loan; 2That's for thy self to bre2d another the2, 2Or ten times hap2ier be it ten for one, 2Ten times thy self were hap2ier than thou art, 2If ten of thine ten times refigured the2: 2Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart, 2Leaving the2 living in posterity? 4Be not self-wil2ed for thou art much to2 fair, 4To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir. 217 2Lo in the orient when the gracious light 2Lifts up his burning head, each under eye 2Doth homage to his new-ap2earing sight, 2Serving with lo2ks his sacred majesty, 4And having climbed the ste2p-up heavenly hil2, 2Resembling strong youth in his mid2le age, 2Yet mortal lo2ks adore his beauty stil2, 2At2ending on his golden pilgrimage: 2But when from highmost pitch with weary car, 2Like fe2ble age he re2leth from the day, 2The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are 2From his low tract and lo2k another way: 4So thou, thy self out-going in thy no2n: 4Unlo2ked on diest unles2 thou get a son. 218 2Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly? 2Swe2ts with swe2ts war not, joy delights in joy: 2Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly, 2Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine an2oy? 2If the true concord of wel2-tuned sounds, 2By unions mar2ied do of2end thine ear, 2They do but swe2tly chide the2, who confounds 2In singlenes2 the parts that thou shouldst bear: 4Mark how one string swe2t husband to another, 2Strikes each in each by mutual ordering; 2Resembling sire, and child, and hap2y mother, 2Who al2 in one, one pleasing note do sing: 4Whose spe2chles2 song being many, se2ming one, 4Sings this to the2, 'Thou single wilt prove none'. 219 2Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye, 2That thou consum'st thy self in single life? 2Ah, if thou is2ueles2 shalt hap to die, 2The world wil2 wail the2 like a makeles2 wife, 2The world wil2 be thy widow and stil2 we2p, 2That thou no form of the2 hast left behind, 2When every private widow wel2 may ke2p, 2By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind: 2Lo2k what an unthrift in the world doth spend 2Shifts but his place, for stil2 the world enjoys it; 2But beauty's waste hath in the world an end, 2And kept unused the user so destroys it: 6No love toward others in that bosom sits 4That on himself such murd'rous shame com2its. 2110 2For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any 2Who for thy self art so unprovident. 2Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many, 2But that thou none lov'st is most evident: 2For thou art so pos2es2ed with murd'rous hate, 2That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire, 2Se2king that beauteous ro2f to ruinate 2Which to repair should be thy chief desire: 2O change thy thought, that I may change my mind, 2Shal2 hate be fairer lodged than gentle love? 2Be as thy presence is gracious and kind, 2Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove, 4Make the2 another self for love of me, 4That beauty stil2 may live in thine or the2. 2112 4As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st, 2In one of thine, from that which thou departest, 2And that fresh blo2d which youngly thou bestow'st, 2Thou mayst cal2 thine, when thou from youth convertest, 2Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase, 2Without this fol2y, age, and cold decay, 2If al2 were minded so, the times should cease, 2And thre2score year would make the world away: 2Let those whom nature hath not made for store, 2Harsh, featureles2, and rude, bar2enly perish: 2Lo2k whom she best endowed, she gave the2 more; 2Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish: 4She carved the2 for her seal, and meant thereby, 4Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die. 2112 2When I do count the clock that tel2s the time, 2And se2 the brave day sunk in hideous night, 2When I behold the violet past prime, 2And sable curls al2 silvered o'er with white: 4When lofty tre2s I se2 bar2en of leaves, 2Which erst from heat did canopy the herd 2And sum2er's gre2n al2 girded up in sheaves 2Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard: 2Then of thy beauty do I question make 2That thou among the wastes of time must go, 2Since swe2ts and beauties do themselves forsake, 2And die as fast as they se2 others grow, 4And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence 4Save bre2d to brave him, when he takes the2 hence. 2113 2O that you were your self, but love you are 2No longer yours, than you your self here live, 2Against this coming end you should prepare, 2And your swe2t semblance to some other give. 2So should that beauty which you hold in lease 2Find no determination, then you were 2Your self again after your self's decease, 2When your swe2t is2ue your swe2t form should bear. 4Who lets so fair a house fal2 to decay, 2Which husbandry in honour might uphold, 2Against the stormy gusts of winter's day 2And bar2en rage of death's eternal cold? 4O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know, 4You had a father, let your son say so. 2114 2Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck, 2And yet methinks I have astronomy, 2But not to tel2 of go2d, or evil luck, 2Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality, 2Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tel2; 2Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind, 2Or say with princes if it shal2 go wel2 2By oft predict that I in heaven find. 2But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive, 2And constant stars in them I read such art 2As truth and beauty shal2 together thrive 2If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert: 6Or else of the2 this I prognosticate, 4Thy end is truth's and beauty's do2m and date. 2115 2When I consider every thing that grows 2Holds in perfection but a lit2le moment. 2That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows 2Whereon the stars in secret influence com2ent. 2When I perceive that men as plants increase, 2Che2red and checked even by the self-same sky: 2Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease, 2And wear their brave state out of memory. 2Then the conceit of this inconstant stay, 2Sets you most rich in youth before my sight, 2Where wasteful time debateth with decay 2To change your day of youth to sul2ied night, 4And al2 in war with Time for love of you, 4As he takes from you, I engraft you new. 2116 4But wherefore do not you a mightier way 2Make war upon this blo2dy tyrant Time? 2And fortify your self in your decay 2With means more bles2ed than my bar2en rhyme? 2Now stand you on the top of hap2y hours, 2And many maiden gardens yet unset, 2With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers, 2Much liker than your painted counterfeit: 2So should the lines of life that life repair 2Which this (Time's pencil) or my pupil pen 2Neither in inward worth nor outward fair 2Can make you live your self in eyes of men. 4To give away your self, ke2ps your self stil2, 4And you must live drawn by your own swe2t skil2. 2117 2Who wil2 believe my verse in time to come 2If it were fil2ed with your most high deserts? 2Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb 2Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts: 4If I could write the beauty of your eyes, 2And in fresh numbers number al2 your graces, 2The age to come would say this poet lies, 2Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces. 2So should my papers (yel2owed with their age) 2Be scorned, like old men of les2 truth than tongue, 2And your true rights be termed a poet's rage, 2And stretched metre of an antique song. 4But were some child of yours alive that time, 4You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme. 2118 2Shal2 I compare the2 to a sum2er's day? 2Thou art more lovely and more temperate: 2Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, 2And sum2er's lease hath al2 to2 short a date: 2Sometime to2 hot the eye of heaven shines, 2And often is his gold complexion dim2ed, 2And every fair from fair sometime declines, 2By chance, or nature's changing course untrim2ed: 4But thy eternal sum2er shal2 not fade, 2Nor lose pos2es2ion of that fair thou ow'st, 2Nor shal2 death brag thou wand'rest in his shade, 2When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st, 4So long as men can breathe or eyes can se2, 4So long lives this, and this gives life to the2. 2119 2Devouring Time blunt thou the lion's paws, 2And make the earth devour her own swe2t bro2d, 2Pluck the ke2n te2th from the fierce tiger's jaws, 2And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blo2d, 2Make glad and sor2y seasons as thou fle2t'st, 2And do whate'er thou wilt swift-fo2ted Time 2To the wide world and al2 her fading swe2ts: 2But I forbid the2 one most heinous crime, 2O carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow, 2Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen, 2Him in thy course untainted do al2ow, 2For beauty's pat2ern to suc2e2ding men. 6Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong, 4My love shal2 in my verse ever live young. 2120 2A woman's face with nature's own hand painted, 2Hast thou the master mistres2 of my pas2ion, 2A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted 2With shifting change as is false women's fashion, 2An eye more bright than theirs, les2 false in rol2ing: 2Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth, 2A man in hue al2 hues in his control2ing, 2Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth. 2And for a woman wert thou first created, 2Til2 nature as she wrought the2 fel2 a-doting, 2And by ad2ition me of the2 defeated, 2By ad2ing one thing to my purpose nothing. 4But since she pricked the2 out for women's pleasure, 4Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure. 2121 4So is it not with me as with that muse, 2Stir2ed by a painted beauty to his verse, 2Who heaven it self for ornament doth use, 2And every fair with his fair doth rehearse, 2Making a couplement of proud compare 2With sun and mo2n, with earth and sea's rich gems: 2With April's first-born flowers and al2 things rare, 2That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems. 2O let me true in love but truly write, 2And then believe me, my love is as fair, 2As any mother's child, though not so bright 2As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air: 4Let them say more that like of hearsay wel2, 4I wil2 not praise that purpose not to sel2. 2122 2My glas2 shal2 not persuade me I am old, 2So long as youth and thou are of one date, 2But when in the2 time's fur2ows I behold, 2Then lo2k I death my days should expiate. 4For al2 that beauty that doth cover the2, 2Is but the se2mly raiment of my heart, 2Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me, 2How can I then be elder than thou art? 2O therefore love be of thyself so wary, 2As I not for my self, but for the2 wil2, 2Bearing thy heart which I wil2 ke2p so chary 2As tender nurse her babe from faring il2. 4Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain, 4Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again. 2123 2As an unperfect actor on the stage, 2Who with his fear is put beside his part, 2Or some fierce thing replete with to2 much rage, 2Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart; 2So I for fear of trust, forget to say, 2The perfect ceremony of love's rite, 2And in mine own love's strength se2m to decay, 2O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might: 4O let my lo2ks be then the eloquence, 2And dumb presagers of my speaking breast, 2Who plead for love, and lo2k for recompense, 2More than that tongue that more hath more expres2ed. 4O learn to read what silent love hath writ, 4To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit. 2124 2Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stel2ed, 2Thy beauty's form in table of my heart, 2My body is the frame wherein 'tis held, 2And perspective it is best painter's art. 2For through the painter must you se2 his skil2, 2To find where your true image pictured lies, 2Which in my bosom's shop is hanging stil2, 2That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes: 2Now se2 what go2d turns eyes for eyes have done, 2Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me 2Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun 2Delights to pe2p, to gaze therein on the2; 6Yet eyes this cun2ing want to grace their art, 4They draw but what they se2, know not the heart. 2125 2Let those who are in favour with their stars, 2Of public honour and proud titles boast, 2Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars 2Unlo2ked for joy in that I honour most; 2Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread, 2But as the marigold at the sun's eye, 2And in themselves their pride lies buried, 2For at a frown they in their glory die. 2The painful war2ior famoused for fight, 2After a thousand victories once foiled, 2Is from the bo2k of honour razed quite, 2And al2 the rest forgot for which he toiled: 4Then hap2y I that love and am beloved 4Where I may not remove nor be removed. 2126 4Lord of my love, to whom in vas2alage 2Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit; 2To the2 I send this writ2en embas2age 2To witnes2 duty, not to show my wit. 2Duty so great, which wit so po2r as mine 2May make se2m bare, in wanting words to show it; 2But that I hope some go2d conceit of thine 2In thy soul's thought (al2 naked) wil2 bestow it: 2Til2 whatsoever star that guides my moving, 2Points on me graciously with fair aspect, 2And puts ap2arel on my tat2ered loving, 2To show me worthy of thy swe2t respect, 4Then may I dare to boast how I do love the2, 4Til2 then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me. 2127 2Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed, 2The dear respose for limbs with travel tired, 2But then begins a journey in my head 2To work my mind, when body's work's expired. 4For then my thoughts (from far where I abide) 2Intend a zealous pilgrimage to the2, 2And ke2p my dro2ping eyelids open wide, 2Lo2king on darknes2 which the blind do se2. 2Save that my soul's imaginary sight 2Presents thy shadow to my sightles2 view, 2Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night) 2Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new. 4Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind, 4For the2, and for my self, no quiet find. 2128 2How can I then return in hap2y plight 2That am debar2ed the benefit of rest? 2When day's op2res2ion is not eased by night, 2But day by night and night by day op2res2ed. 2And each (though enemies to either's reign) 2Do in consent shake hands to torture me, 2The one by toil, the other to complain 2How far I toil, stil2 farther of2 from the2. 4I tel2 the day to please him thou art bright, 2And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven: 2So flat2er I the swart-complexioned night, 2When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even. 4But day doth daily draw my sor2ows longer, 4And night doth nightly make grief's length se2m stronger 2129 2When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes, 2I al2 alone bewe2p my outcast state, 2And trouble deaf heaven with my bo2tles2 cries, 2And lo2k upon my self and curse my fate, 2Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, 2Featured like him, like him with friends pos2es2ed, 2Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope, 2With what I most enjoy contented least, 2Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising, 2Haply I think on the2, and then my state, 2(Like to the lark at break of day arising 2From sul2en earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate, 6For thy swe2t love remembered such wealth brings, 4That then I scorn to change my state with kings. 2130 2When to the ses2ions of swe2t silent thought, 2I sum2on up remembrance of things past, 2I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought, 2And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste: 2Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow) 2For precious friends hid in death's dateles2 night, 2And we2p afresh love's long since cancel2ed woe, 2And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight. 2Then can I grieve at grievances foregone, 2And heavily from woe to woe tel2 o'er 2The sad ac2ount of fore-bemoaned moan, 2Which I new pay as if not paid before. 4But if the while I think on the2 (dear friend) 4Al2 los2es are restored, and sor2ows end. 2131 4Thy bosom is endeared with al2 hearts, 2Which I by lacking have sup2osed dead, 2And there reigns love and al2 love's loving parts, 2And al2 those friends which I thought buried. 2How many a holy and obsequious tear 2Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye, 2As interest of the dead, which now ap2ear, 2But things removed that hid2en in the2 lie. 2Thou art the grave where buried love doth live, 2Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone, 2Who al2 their parts of me to the2 did give, 2That due of many, now is thine alone. 4Their images I loved, I view in the2, 4And thou (al2 they) hast al2 the al2 of me. 2132 2If thou survive my wel2-contented day, 2When that churl death my bones with dust shal2 cover 2And shalt by fortune once more re-survey 2These po2r rude lines of thy deceased lover: 4Compare them with the bet2'ring of the time, 2And though they be outstrip2ed by every pen, 2Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme, 2Exce2ded by the height of hap2ier men. 2O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought, 2'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age, 2A dearer birth than this his love had brought 2To march in ranks of bet2er equipage: 4But since he died and poets bet2er prove, 4Theirs for their style I'l2 read, his for his love'. 2132 2Ful2 many a glorious morning have I se2n, 2Flat2er the mountain tops with sovereign eye, 2Kis2ing with golden face the meadows gre2n; 2Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy: 2Anon permit the basest clouds to ride, 2With ugly rack on his celestial face, 2And from the forlorn world his visage hide 2Stealing unse2n to west with this disgrace: 4Even so my sun one early morn did shine, 2With al2 triumphant splendour on my brow, 2But out alack, he was but one hour mine, 2The region cloud hath masked him from me now. 4Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth, 4Suns of the world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth. 2134 2Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day, 2And make me travel forth without my cloak, 2To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way, 2Hiding thy brav'ry in their rot2en smoke? 2'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break, 2To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face, 2For no man wel2 of such a salve can speak, 2That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace: 2Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief, 2Though thou repent, yet I have stil2 the los2, 2Th' of2ender's sor2ow lends but weak relief 2To him that bears the strong of2ence's cros2. 6Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds, 4And they are rich, and ransom al2 il2 de2ds. 2135 2No more be grieved at that which thou hast done, 2Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud, 2Clouds and eclipses stain both mo2n and sun, 2And loathsome canker lives in swe2test bud. 2Al2 men make faults, and even I in this, 2Authorizing thy trespas2 with compare, 2My self cor2upting salving thy amis2, 2Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are: 2For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense, 2Thy adverse party is thy advocate, 2And 'gainst my self a lawful plea com2ence: 2Such civil war is in my love and hate, 4That I an ac2es2ary ne2ds must be, 4To that swe2t thief which sourly robs from me. 2136 4Let me confes2 that we two must be twain, 2Although our undivided loves are one: 2So shal2 those blots that do with me remain, 2Without thy help, by me be borne alone. 2In our two loves there is but one respect, 2Though in our lives a separable spite, 2Which though it alter not love's sole ef2ect, 2Yet doth it steal swe2t hours from love's delight. 2I may not evermore acknowledge the2, 2Lest my bewailed guilt should do the2 shame, 2Nor thou with public kindnes2 honour me, 2Unles2 thou take that honour from thy name: 4But do not so, I love the2 in such sort, 4As thou being mine, mine is thy go2d report. 2137 2As a decrepit father takes delight, 2To se2 his active child do de2ds of youth, 2So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite 2Take al2 my comfort of thy worth and truth. 4For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit, 2Or any of these al2, or al2, or more 2Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit, 2I make my love engrafted to this store: 2So then I am not lame, po2r, nor despised, 2Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give, 2That I in thy abundance am suf2iced, 2And by a part of al2 thy glory live: 4Lo2k what is best, that best I wish in the2, 4This wish I have, then ten times hap2y me. 2138 2How can my muse want subject to invent 2While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse, 2Thine own swe2t argument, to2 excel2ent, 2For every vulgar paper to rehearse? 2O give thy self the thanks if aught in me, 2Worthy perusal stand against thy sight, 2For who's so dumb that can2ot write to the2, 2When thou thy self dost give invention light? 4Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth 2Than those old nine which rhymers invocate, 2And he that cal2s on the2, let him bring forth 2Eternal numbers to outlive long date. 4If my slight muse do please these curious days, 4The pain be mine, but thine shal2 be the praise. 2139 2O how thy worth with man2ers may I sing, 2When thou art al2 the bet2er part of me? 2What can mine own praise to mine own self bring: 2And what is't but mine own when I praise the2? 2Even for this, let us divided live, 2And our dear love lose name of single one, 2That by this separation I may give: 2That due to the2 which thou deserv'st alone: 2O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove, 2Were it not thy sour leisure gave swe2t leave, 2To entertain the time with thoughts of love, 2Which time and thoughts so swe2tly doth deceive. 6And that thou teachest how to make one twain, 4By praising him here who doth hence remain. 2140 2Take al2 my loves, my love, yea take them al2, 2What hast thou then more than thou hadst before? 2No love, my love, that thou mayst true love cal2, 2Al2 mine was thine, before thou hadst this more: 2Then if for my love, thou my love receivest, 2I can2ot blame the2, for my love thou usest, 2But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest 2By wilful taste of what thy self refusest. 2I do forgive thy rob2ery gentle thief 2Although thou steal the2 al2 my poverty: 2And yet love knows it is a greater grief 2To bear greater wrong, than hate's known injury. 4Lascivious grace, in whom al2 il2 wel2 shows, 4Kil2 me with spites yet we must not be foes. 2141 4Those pret2y wrongs that liberty com2its, 2When I am sometime absent from thy heart, 2Thy beauty, and thy years ful2 wel2 befits, 2For stil2 temptation fol2ows where thou art. 2Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won, 2Beauteous thou art, therefore to be as2ailed. 2And when a woman wo2s, what woman's son, 2Wil2 sourly leave her til2 he have prevailed? 2Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear, 2And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth, 2Who lead the2 in their riot even there 2Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth: 4Hers by thy beauty tempting her to the2, 4Thine by thy beauty being false to me. 2142 2That thou hast her it is not al2 my grief, 2And yet it may be said I loved her dearly, 2That she hath the2 is of my wailing chief, 2A los2 in love that touches me more nearly. 4Loving of2enders thus I wil2 excuse ye, 2Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her, 2And for my sake even so doth she abuse me, 2Suf2'ring my friend for my sake to ap2rove her. 2If I lose the2, my los2 is my love's gain, 2And losing her, my friend hath found that los2, 2Both find each other, and I lose both twain, 2And both for my sake lay on me this cros2, 4But here's the joy, my friend and I are one, 4Swe2t flat2ery, then she loves but me alone. 2143 2When most I wink then do mine eyes best se2, 2For al2 the day they view things unrespected, 2But when I sle2p, in dreams they lo2k on the2, 2And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed. 2Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright 2How would thy shadow's form, form hap2y show, 2To the clear day with thy much clearer light, 2When to unse2ing eyes thy shade shines so! 4How would (I say) mine eyes be bles2ed made, 2By lo2king on the2 in the living day, 2When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade, 2Through heavy sle2p on sightles2 eyes doth stay! 4Al2 days are nights to se2 til2 I se2 the2, 4And nights bright days when dreams do show the2 me. 2142 2If the dul2 substance of my flesh were thought, 2Injurious distance should not stop my way, 2For then despite of space I would be brought, 2From limits far remote, where thou dost stay, 2No mat2er then although my fo2t did stand 2Upon the farthest earth removed from the2, 2For nimble thought can jump both sea and land, 2As so2n as think the place where he would be. 2But ah, thought kil2s me that I am not thought 2To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone, 2But that so much of earth and water wrought, 2I must at2end, time's leisure with my moan. 6Receiving nought by elements so slow, 4But heavy tears, badges of either's woe. 2145 2The other two, slight air, and purging fire, 2Are both with the2, wherever I abide, 2The first my thought, the other my desire, 2These present-absent with swift motion slide. 2For when these quicker elements are gone 2In tender embas2y of love to the2, 2My life being made of four, with two alone, 2Sinks down to death, op2res2ed with melancholy. 2Until life's composition be recured, 2By those swift mes2engers returned from the2, 2Who even but now come back again as2ured, 2Of thy fair health, recounting it to me. 4This told, I joy, but then no longer glad, 4I send them back again and straight grow sad. 2146 4Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war, 2How to divide the conquest of thy sight, 2Mine eye, my heart thy picture's sight would bar, 2My heart, mine eye the fre2dom of that right, 2My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie, 2(A closet never pierced with crystal eyes) 2But the defendant doth that plea deny, 2And says in him thy fair ap2earance lies. 2To side this title is impanel2ed 2A quest of thoughts, al2 tenants to the heart, 2And by their verdict is determined 2The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part. 4As thus, mine eye's due is thy outward part, 4And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart. 2147 2Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is to2k, 2And each doth go2d turns now unto the other, 2When that mine eye is famished for a lo2k, 2Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother; 4With my love's picture then my eye doth feast, 2And to the painted banquet bids my heart: 2Another time mine eye is my heart's guest, 2And in his thoughts of love doth share a part. 2So either by thy picture or my love, 2Thy self away, art present stil2 with me, 2For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move, 2And I am stil2 with them, and they with the2. 4Or if they sle2p, thy picture in my sight 4Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight. 2148 2How careful was I when I to2k my way, 2Each trifle under truest bars to thrust, 2That to my use it might unused stay 2From hands of falseho2d, in sure wards of trust! 2But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are, 2Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief, 2Thou best of dearest, and mine only care, 2Art left the prey of every vulgar thief. 4The2 have I not locked up in any chest, 2Save where thou art not, though I fe2l thou art, 2Within the gentle closure of my breast, 2From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part, 4And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear, 4For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear. 2149 2Against that time (if ever that time come) 2When I shal2 se2 the2 frown on my defects, 2When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum, 2Cal2ed to that audit by advised respects, 2Against that time when thou shalt strangely pas2, 2And scarcely gre2t me with that sun thine eye, 2When love converted from the thing it was 2Shal2 reasons find of set2led gravity; 2Against that time do I ensconce me here 2Within the knowledge of mine own desert, 2And this my hand, against my self uprear, 2To guard the lawful reasons on thy part, 6To leave po2r me, thou hast the strength of laws, 4Since why to love, I can al2ege no cause. 2150 2How heavy do I journey on the way, 2When what I se2k (my weary travel's end) 2Doth teach that case and that repose to say 2'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.' 2The beast that bears me, tired with my woe, 2Plods dul2y on, to bear that weight in me, 2As if by some instinct the wretch did know 2His rider loved not spe2d being made from the2: 2The blo2dy spur can2ot provoke him on, 2That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide, 2Which heavily he answers with a groan, 2More sharp to me than spur2ing to his side, 4For that same groan doth put this in my mind, 4My grief lies onward and my joy behind. 2151 4Thus can my love excuse the slow of2ence, 2Of my dul2 bearer, when from the2 I spe2d, 2From where thou art, why should I haste me thence? 2Til2 I return of posting is no ne2d. 2O what excuse wil2 my po2r beast then find, 2When swift extremity can se2m but slow? 2Then should I spur though mounted on the wind, 2In winged spe2d no motion shal2 I know, 2Then can no horse with my desire ke2p pace, 2Therefore desire (of perfect'st love being made) 2Shal2 neigh (no dul2 flesh) in his fiery race, 2But love, for love, thus shal2 excuse my jade, 4Since from the2 going, he went wilful-slow, 4Towards the2 I'l2 run, and give him leave to go. 2152 2So am I as the rich whose bles2ed key, 2Can bring him to his swe2t up-locked treasure, 2The which he wil2 not every hour survey, 2For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure. 4Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare, 2Since seldom coming in that long year set, 2Like stones of worth they thinly placed are, 2Or captain jewels in the carcanet. 2So is the time that ke2ps you as my chest 2Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide, 2To make some special instant special-blest, 2By new unfolding his imprisoned pride. 4Bles2ed are you whose worthines2 gives scope, 4Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope. 2153 2What is your substance, whereof are you made, 2That mil2ions of strange shadows on you tend? 2Since every one, hath every one, one shade, 2And you but one, can every shadow lend: 2Describe Adonis and the counterfeit, 2Is po2rly imitated after you, 2On Helen's che2k al2 art of beauty set, 2And you in Grecian tires are painted new: 4Speak of the spring, and foison of the year, 2The one doth shadow of your beauty show, 2The other as your bounty doth ap2ear, 2And you in every bles2ed shape we know. 4In al2 external grace you have some part, 4But you like none, none you for constant heart. 2154 2O how much more doth beauty beauteous se2m, 2By that swe2t ornament which truth doth give! 2The rose lo2ks fair, but fairer we it de2m 2For that swe2t odour, which doth in it live: 2The canker blo2ms have ful2 as de2p a dye, 2As the perfumed tincture of the roses, 2Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly, 2When sum2er's breath their masked buds discloses: 2But for their virtue only is their show, 2They live unwo2ed, and unrespected fade, 2Die to themselves. Swe2t roses do not so, 2Of their swe2t deaths, are swe2test odours made: 6And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth, 4When that shal2 vade, by verse distil2s your truth. 2152 2Not marble, nor the gilded monuments 2Of princes shal2 outlive this powerful rhyme, 2But you shal2 shine more bright in these contents 2Than unswept stone, besmeared with slut2ish time. 2When wasteful war shal2 statues overturn, 2And broils ro2t out the work of masonry, 2Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shal2 burn: 2The living record of your memory. 2'Gainst death, and al2-oblivious enmity 2Shal2 you pace forth, your praise shal2 stil2 find ro2m, 2Even in the eyes of al2 posterity 2That wear this world out to the ending do2m. 4So til2 the judgment that your self arise, 4You live in this, and dwel2 in lovers' eyes. 2156 4Swe2t love renew thy force, be it not said 2Thy edge should blunter be than ap2etite, 2Which but to-day by fe2ding is al2ayed, 2To-mor2ow sharpened in his former might. 2So love be thou, although to-day thou fil2 2Thy hungry eyes, even til2 they wink with fulnes2, 2To-mor2ow se2 again, and do not kil2 2The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulnes2: 2Let this sad interim like the ocean be 2Which parts the shore, where two contracted new, 2Come daily to the banks, that when they se2: 2Return of love, more blest may be the view. 4Or cal2 it winter, which being ful2 of care, 4Makes sum2er's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare. 2157 2Being your slave what should I do but tend, 2Upon the hours, and times of your desire? 2I have no precious time at al2 to spend; 2Nor services to do til2 you require. 4Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour, 2Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you, 2Nor think the bit2ernes2 of absence sour, 2When you have bid your servant once adieu. 2Nor dare I question with my jealous thought, 2Where you may be, or your af2airs sup2ose, 2But like a sad slave stay and think of nought 2Save where you are, how hap2y you make those. 4So true a fo2l is love, that in your wil2, 4(Though you do any thing) he thinks no il2. 2158 2That god forbid, that made me first your slave, 2I should in thought control your times of pleasure, 2Or at your hand th' ac2ount of hours to crave, 2Being your vas2al bound to stay your leisure. 2O let me suf2er (being at your beck) 2Th' imprisoned absence of your liberty, 2And patience tame to suf2erance bide each check, 2Without ac2using you of injury. 4Be where you list, your charter is so strong, 2That you your self may privilage your time 2To what you wil2, to you it doth belong, 2Your self to pardon of self-doing crime. 4I am to wait, though waiting so be hel2, 4Not blame your pleasure be it il2 or wel2. 2159 2If there be nothing new, but that which is, 2Hath be2n before, how are our brains beguiled, 2Which labouring for invention bear amis 2The second burthen of a former child! 2O that record could with a backward lo2k, 2Even of five hundred courses of the sun, 2Show me your image in some antique bo2k, 2Since mind at first in character was done. 2That I might se2 what the old world could say, 2To this composed wonder of your frame, 2Whether we are mended, or whether bet2er they, 2Or whether revolution be the same. 6O sure I am the wits of former days, 4To subjects worse have given admiring praise. 2160 2Like as the waves make towards the peb2led shore, 2So do our minutes hasten to their end, 2Each changing place with that which goes before, 2In sequent toil al2 forwards do contend. 2Nativity once in the main of light, 2Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned, 2Cro2ked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight, 2And Time that gave, doth now his gift confound. 2Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth, 2And delves the paral2els in beauty's brow, 2Fe2ds on the rarities of nature's truth, 2And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow. 4And yet to times in hope, my verse shal2 stand 4Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand. 2161 4Is it thy wil2, thy image should ke2p open 2My heavy eyelids to the weary night? 2Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken, 2While shadows like to the2 do mock my sight? 2Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from the2 2So far from home into my de2ds to pry, 2To find out shames and idle hours in me, 2The scope and tenure of thy jealousy? 2O no, thy love though much, is not so great, 2It is my love that ke2ps mine eye awake, 2Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat, 2To play the watchman ever for thy sake. 4For the2 watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere, 4From me far of2, with others al2 to2 near. 2162 2Sin of self-love pos2es2eth al2 mine eye, 2And al2 my soul, and al2 my every part; 2And for this sin there is no remedy, 2It is so grounded inward in my heart. 4Methinks no face so gracious is as mine, 2No shape so true, no truth of such ac2ount, 2And for my self mine own worth do define, 2As I al2 other in al2 worths surmount. 2But when my glas2 shows me my self inde2d 2beated and chopt with tan2ed antiquity, 2Mine own self-love quite contrary I read: 2Self, so self-loving were iniquity. 4'Tis the2 (my self) that for my self I praise, 4Painting my age with beauty of thy days. 2163 2Against my love shal2 be as I am now 2With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn, 2When hours have drained his blo2d and fil2ed his brow 2With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn 2Hath travel2ed on to age's ste2py night, 2And al2 those beauties whereof now he's king 2Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight, 2Stealing away the treasure of his spring: 4For such a time do I now fortify 2Against confounding age's cruel knife, 2That he shal2 never cut from memory 2My swe2t love's beauty, though my lover's life. 4His beauty shal2 in these black lines be se2n, 4And they shal2 live, and he in them stil2 gre2n. 2164 2When I have se2n by Time's fel2 hand defaced 2The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age, 2When sometime lofty towers I se2 down-rased, 2And bras2 eternal slave to mortal rage. 2When I have se2n the hungry ocean gain 2Advantage on the kingdom of the shore, 2And the firm soil win of the watery main, 2Increasing store with los2, and los2 with store. 2When I have se2n such interchange of State, 2Or state it self confounded, to decay, 2Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate 2That Time wil2 come and take my love away. 6This thought is as a death which can2ot cho2se 4But we2p to have, that which it fears to lose. 2165 2Since bras2, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundles2 sea, 2But sad mortality o'ersways their power, 2How with this rage shal2 beauty hold a plea, 2Whose action is no stronger than a flower? 2O how shal2 sum2er's honey breath hold out, 2Against the wrackful siege of bat2'ring days, 2When rocks impregnable are not so stout, 2Nor gates of ste2l so strong but time decays? 2O fearful meditation, where alack, 2Shal2 Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid? 2Or what strong hand can hold his swift fo2t back, 2Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid? 4O none, unles2 this miracle have might, 4That in black ink my love may stil2 shine bright. 2162 4Tired with al2 these for restful death I cry, 2As to behold desert a beg2ar born, 2And ne2dy nothing trim2ed in jol2ity, 2And purest faith unhap2ily forsworn, 2And gilded honour shameful2y misplaced, 2And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted, 2And right perfection wrongful2y disgraced, 2And strength by limping sway disabled 2And art made tongue-tied by authority, 2And fol2y (doctor-like) control2ing skil2, 2And simple truth miscal2ed simplicity, 2And captive go2d at2ending captain il2. 4Tired with al2 these, from these would I be gone, 4Save that to die, I leave my love alone. 2167 2Ah wherefore with infection should he live, 2And with his presence grace impiety, 2That sin by him advantage should achieve, 2And lace it self with his society? 4Why should false painting imitate his che2k, 2And steal dead se2ming of his living hue? 2Why should po2r beauty indirectly se2k, 2Roses of shadow, since his rose is true? 2Why should he live, now nature bankrupt is, 2Beg2ared of blo2d to blush through lively veins, 2For she hath no exchequer now but his, 2And proud of many, lives upon his gains? 4O him she stores, to show what wealth she had, 4In days long since, before these last so bad. 2168 2Thus is his che2k the map of days outworn, 2When beauty lived and died as flowers do now, 2Before these bastard signs of fair were born, 2Or durst inhabit on a living brow: 2Before the golden tres2es of the dead, 2The right of sepulchres, were shorn away, 2To live a second life on second head, 2Ere beauty's dead fle2ce made another gay: 4In him those holy antique hours are se2n, 2Without al2 ornament, it self and true, 2Making no sum2er of another's gre2n, 2Rob2ing no old to dres2 his beauty new, 4And him as for a map doth Nature store, 4To show false Art what beauty was of yore. 2169 2Those parts of the2 that the world's eye doth view, 2Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend: 2Al2 tongues (the voice of souls) give the2 that due, 2Ut2ering bare truth, even so as foes com2end. 2Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned, 2But those same tongues that give the2 so thine own, 2In other ac2ents do this praise confound 2By se2ing farther than the eye hath shown. 2They lo2k into the beauty of thy mind, 2And that in gues2 they measure by thy de2ds, 2Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind) 2To thy fair flower ad2 the rank smel2 of we2ds: 6But why thy odour matcheth not thy show, 4The soil is this, that thou dost com2on grow. 2170 2That thou art blamed shal2 not be thy defect, 2For slander's mark was ever yet the fair, 2The ornament of beauty is suspect, 2A crow that flies in heaven's swe2test air. 2So thou be go2d, slander doth but ap2rove, 2Thy worth the greater being wo2ed of time, 2For canker vice the swe2test buds doth love, 2And thou present'st a pure unstained prime. 2Thou hast pas2ed by the ambush of young days, 2Either not as2ailed, or victor being charged, 2Yet this thy praise can2ot be so thy praise, 2To tie up envy, evermore enlarged, 4If some suspect of il2 masked not thy show, 4Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe. 2171 4No longer mourn for me when I am dead, 2Than you shal2 hear the surly sul2en bel2 2Give warning to the world that I am fled 2From this vile world with vilest worms to dwel2: 2Nay if you read this line, remember not, 2The hand that writ it, for I love you so, 2That I in your swe2t thoughts would be forgot, 2If thinking on me then should make you woe. 2O if (I say) you lo2k upon this verse, 2When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay, 2Do not so much as my po2r name rehearse; 2But let your love even with my life decay. 4Lest the wise world should lo2k into your moan, 4And mock you with me after I am gone. 2172 2O lest the world should task you to recite, 2What merit lived in me that you should love 2After my death (dear love) forget me quite, 2For you in me can nothing worthy prove. 4Unles2 you would devise some virtuous lie, 2To do more for me than mine own desert, 2And hang more praise upon deceased I, 2Than nig2ard truth would wil2ingly impart: 2O lest your true love may se2m false in this, 2That you for love speak wel2 of me untrue, 2My name be buried where my body is, 2And live no more to shame nor me, nor you. 4For I am shamed by that which I bring forth, 4And so should you, to love things nothing worth. 2173 2That time of year thou mayst in me behold, 2When yel2ow leaves, or none, or few do hang 2Upon those boughs which shake against the cold, 2Bare ruined choirs, where late the swe2t birds sang. 2In me thou se2st the twilight of such day, 2As after sunset fadeth in the west, 2Which by and by black night doth take away, 2Death's second self that seals up al2 in rest. 4In me thou se2st the glowing of such fire, 2That on the ashes of his youth doth lie, 2As the death-bed, whereon it must expire, 2Consumed with that which it was nourished by. 4This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong, 4To love that wel2, which thou must leave ere long. 2174 2But be contented when that fel2 ar2est, 2Without al2 bail shal2 car2y me away, 2My life hath in this line some interest, 2Which for memorial stil2 with the2 shal2 stay. 2When thou reviewest this, thou dost review, 2The very part was consecrate to the2, 2The earth can have but earth, which is his due, 2My spirit is thine the bet2er part of me, 2So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life, 2The prey of worms, my body being dead, 2The coward conquest of a wretch's knife, 2To2 base of the2 to be remembered, 6The worth of that, is that which it contains, 4And that is this, and this with the2 remains. 2175 2So are you to my thoughts as fo2d to life, 2Or as swe2t-seasoned showers are to the ground; 2And for the peace of you I hold such strife 2As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found. 2Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon 2Doubting the filching age wil2 steal his treasure, 2Now counting best to be with you alone, 2Then bet2ered that the world may se2 my pleasure, 2Sometime al2 ful2 with feasting on your sight, 2And by and by clean starved for a lo2k, 2Pos2es2ing or pursuing no delight 2Save what is had, or must from you be to2k. 4Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day, 4Or glut2oning on al2, or al2 away. 2176 4Why is my verse so bar2en of new pride? 2So far from variation or quick change? 2Why with the time do I not glance aside 2To new-found methods, and to compounds strange? 2Why write I stil2 al2 one, ever the same, 2And ke2p invention in a noted we2d, 2That every word doth almost tel2 my name, 2Showing their birth, and where they did proce2d? 2O know swe2t love I always write of you, 2And you and love are stil2 my argument: 2So al2 my best is dres2ing old words new, 2Spending again what is already spent: 4For as the sun is daily new and old, 4So is my love stil2 tel2ing what is told. 2172 2Thy glas2 wil2 show the2 how thy beauties wear, 2Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste, 2These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint wil2 bear, 2And of this bo2k, this learning mayst thou taste. 4The wrinkles which thy glas2 wil2 truly show, 2Of mouthed graves wil2 give the2 memory, 2Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know, 2Time's thievish progres2 to eternity. 2Lo2k what thy memory can2ot contain, 2Com2it to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find 2Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain, 2To take a new acquaintance of thy mind. 4These of2ices, so oft as thou wilt lo2k, 4Shal2 profit the2, and much enrich thy bo2k. 2178 2So oft have I invoked the2 for my muse, 2And found such fair as2istance in my verse, 2As every alien pen hath got my use, 2And under the2 their poesy disperse. 2Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing, 2And heavy ignorance aloft to fly, 2Have ad2ed feathers to the learned's wing, 2And given grace a double majesty. 2Yet be most proud of that which I compile, 2Whose influence is thine, and born of the2, 2In others' works thou dost but mend the style, 2And arts with thy swe2t graces graced be. 4But thou art al2 my art, and dost advance 4As high as learning, my rude ignorance. 2179 2Whilst I alone did cal2 upon thy aid, 2My verse alone had al2 thy gentle grace, 2But now my gracious numbers are decayed, 2And my sick muse doth give an other place. 2I grant (swe2t love) thy lovely argument 2Deserves the travail of a worthier pen, 2Yet what of the2 thy poet doth invent, 2He robs the2 of, and pays it the2 again, 2He lends the2 virtue, and he stole that word, 2From thy behaviour, beauty doth he give 2And found it in thy che2k: he can af2ord 2No praise to the2, but what in the2 doth live. 6Then thank him not for that which he doth say, 4Since what he owes the2, thou thy self dost pay. 2180 2O how I faint when I of you do write, 2Knowing a bet2er spirit doth use your name, 2And in the praise thereof spends al2 his might, 2To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame. 2But since your worth (wide as the ocean is) 2The humble as the proudest sail doth bear, 2My saucy bark (inferior far to his) 2On your broad main doth wilful2y ap2ear. 2Your shal2owest help wil2 hold me up afloat, 2Whilst he upon your soundles2 de2p doth ride, 2Or (being wrecked) I am a worthles2 boat, 2He of tal2 building, and of go2dly pride. 4Then if he thrive and I be cast away, 4The worst was this, my love was my decay. 2181 4Or I shal2 live your epitaph to make, 2Or you survive when I in earth am rot2en, 2From hence your memory death can2ot take, 2Although in me each part wil2 be forgot2en. 2Your name from hence im2ortal life shal2 have, 2Though I (once gone) to al2 the world must die, 2The earth can yield me but a com2on grave, 2When you entombed in men's eyes shal2 lie, 2Your monument shal2 be my gentle verse, 2Which eyes not yet created shal2 o'er-read, 2And tongues to be, your being shal2 rehearse, 2When al2 the breathers of this world are dead, 4You stil2 shal2 live (such virtue hath my pen) 4Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men. 2182 2I grant thou wert not mar2ied to my muse, 2And therefore mayst without at2aint o'erlo2k 2The dedicated words which writers use 2Of their fair subject, bles2ing every bo2k. 4Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue, 2Finding thy worth a limit past my praise, 2And therefore art enforced to se2k anew, 2Some fresher stamp of the time-bet2ering days. 2And do so love, yet when they have devised, 2What strained touches rhetoric can lend, 2Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized, 2In true plain words, by thy true-tel2ing friend. 4And their gros2 painting might be bet2er used, 4Where che2ks ne2d blo2d, in the2 it is abused. 2183 2I never saw that you did painting ne2d, 2And therefore to your fair no painting set, 2I found (or thought I found) you did exce2d, 2That bar2en tender of a poet's debt: 2And therefore have I slept in your report, 2That you your self being extant wel2 might show, 2How far a modern quil2 doth come to2 short, 2Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow. 4This silence for my sin you did impute, 2Which shal2 be most my glory being dumb, 2For I impair not beauty being mute, 2When others would give life, and bring a tomb. 4There lives more life in one of your fair eyes, 4Than both your poets can in praise devise. 2184 2Who is it that says most, which can say more, 2Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you? 2In whose confine im2ured is the store, 2Which should example where your equal grew. 2Lean penury within that pen doth dwel2, 2That to his subject lends not some smal2 glory, 2But he that writes of you, if he can tel2, 2That you are you, so dignifies his story. 2Let him but copy what in you is writ, 2Not making worse what nature made so clear, 2And such a counterpart shal2 fame his wit, 2Making his style admired every where. 6You to your beauteous bles2ings ad2 a curse, 4Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse. 2185 2My tongue-tied muse in man2ers holds her stil2, 2While com2ents of your praise richly compiled, 2Reserve their character with golden quil2, 2And precious phrase by al2 the Muses filed. 2I think go2d thoughts, whilst other write go2d words, 2And like unlet2ered clerk stil2 cry Amen, 2To every hymn that able spirit af2ords, 2In polished form of wel2 refined pen. 2Hearing you praised, I say 'tis so, 'tis true, 2And to the most of praise ad2 something more, 2But that is in my thought, whose love to you 2(Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before, 4Then others, for the breath of words respect, 4Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in ef2ect. 2186 4Was it the proud ful2 sail of his great verse, 2Bound for the prize of (al2 to2 precious) you, 2That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse, 2Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew? 2Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write, 2Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead? 2No, neither he, nor his compe2rs by night 2Giving him aid, my verse astonished. 2He nor that af2able familiar ghost 2Which nightly gul2s him with intel2igence, 2As victors of my silence can2ot boast, 2I was not sick of any fear from thence. 4But when your countenance fil2ed up his line, 4Then lacked I mat2er, that enfe2bled mine. 2187 2Farewel2! thou art to2 dear for my pos2es2ing, 2And like enough thou know'st thy estimate, 2The charter of thy worth gives the2 releasing: 2My bonds in the2 are al2 determinate. 4For how do I hold the2 but by thy granting, 2And for that riches where is my deserving? 2The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting, 2And so my patent back again is swerving. 2Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing, 2Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking, 2So thy great gift upon misprision growing, 2Comes home again, on bet2er judgement making. 4Thus have I had the2 as a dream doth flat2er, 4In sle2p a king, but waking no such mat2er. 2182 2When thou shalt be disposed to set me light, 2And place my merit in the eye of scorn, 2Upon thy side, against my self I'l2 fight, 2And prove the2 virtuous, though thou art forsworn: 2With mine own weaknes2 being best acquainted, 2Upon thy part I can set down a story 2Of faults concealed, wherein I am at2ainted: 2That thou in losing me, shalt win much glory: 4And I by this wil2 be a gainer to2, 2For bending al2 my loving thoughts on the2, 2The injuries that to my self I do, 2Doing the2 vantage, double-vantage me. 4Such is my love, to the2 I so belong, 4That for thy right, my self wil2 bear al2 wrong. 2189 2Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault, 2And I wil2 com2ent upon that of2ence, 2Speak of my lamenes2, and I straight wil2 halt: 2Against thy reasons making no defence. 2Thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so il2, 2To set a form upon desired change, 2As I'l2 my self disgrace, knowing thy wil2, 2I wil2 acquaintance strangle and lo2k strange: 2Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue, 2Thy swe2t beloved name no more shal2 dwel2, 2Lest I (to2 much profane) should do it wronk: 2And haply of our old acquaintance tel2. 6For the2, against my self I'l2 vow debate, 4For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate. 2190 2Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now, 2Now while the world is bent my de2ds to cros2, 2join with the spite of fortune, make me bow, 2And do not drop in for an after-los2: 2Ah do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sor2ow, 2Come in the rearward of a conquered woe, 2Give not a windy night a rainy mor2ow, 2To linger out a purposed overthrow. 2If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last, 2When other pet2y griefs have done their spite, 2But in the onset come, so shal2 I taste 2At first the very worst of fortune's might. 4And other strains of woe, which now se2m woe, 4Compared with los2 of the2, wil2 not se2m so. 2191 4Some glory in their birth, some in their skil2, 2Some in their wealth, some in their body's force, 2Some in their garments though new-fangled il2: 2Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse. 2And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure, 2Wherein it finds a joy above the rest, 2But these particulars are not my measure, 2Al2 these I bet2er in one general best. 2Thy love is bet2er than high birth to me, 2Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs, 2Of more delight than hawks and horses be: 2And having the2, of al2 men's pride I boast. 4Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take, 4Al2 this away, and me most wretchcd make. 2192 2But do thy worst to steal thy self away, 2For term of life thou art as2ured mine, 2And life no longer than thy love wil2 stay, 2For it depends upon that love of thine. 4Then ne2d I not to fear the worst of wrongs, 2When in the least of them my life hath end, 2I se2, a bet2er state to me belongs 2Than that, which on thy humour doth depend. 2Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind, 2Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie, 2O what a hap2y title do I find, 2Hap2y to have thy love, hap2y to die! 4But what's so bles2ed-fair that fears no blot? 4Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not. 2193 2So shal2 I live, sup2osing thou art true, 2Like a deceived husband, so love's face, 2May stil2 se2m love to me, though altered new: 2Thy lo2ks with me, thy heart in other place. 2For there can live no hatred in thine eye, 2Therefore in that I can2ot know thy change, 2In many's lo2ks, the false heart's history 2Is writ in mo2ds and frowns and wrinkles strange. 4But heaven in thy creation did decre2, 2That in thy face swe2t love should ever dwel2, 2Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be, 2Thy lo2ks should nothing thence, but swe2tnes2 tel2. 4How like Eve's ap2le doth thy beauty grow, 4If thy swe2t virtue answer not thy show. 2194 2They that have power to hurt, and wil2 do none, 2That do not do the thing, they most do show, 2Who moving others, are themselves as stone, 2Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow: 2They rightly do inherit heaven's graces, 2And husband nature's riches from expense, 2Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces, 2Others, but stewards of their excel2ence: 2The sum2er's flower is to the sum2er swe2t, 2Though to it self, it only live and die, 2But if that flower with base infection me2t, 2The basest we2d outbraves his dignity: 6For swe2test things turn sourest by their de2ds, 4Lilies that fester, smel2 far worse than we2ds. 2195 2How swe2t and lovely dost thou make the shame, 2Which like a canker in the fragrant rose, 2Doth spot the beauty of thy bud2ing name! 2O in what swe2ts dost thou thy sins enclose! 2That tongue that tel2s the story of thy days, 2(Making lascivious com2ents on thy sport) 2Can2ot dispraise, but in a kind of praise, 2Naming thy name, bles2es an il2 report. 2O what a mansion have those vices got, 2Which for their habitation chose out the2, 2Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot, 2And al2 things turns to fair, that eyes can se2! 4Take he2d (dear heart) of this large privilege, 4The hardest knife il2-used doth lose his edge. 2196 4Some say thy fault is youth, some wanton2es2, 2Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport, 2Both grace and faults are loved of more and les2: 2Thou mak'st faults graces, that to the2 resort: 2As on the finger of a throned que2n, 2The basest jewel wil2 be wel2 este2med: 2So are those er2ors that in the2 are se2n, 2To truths translated, and for true things de2med. 2How many lambs might the stern wolf betray, 2If like a lamb he could his lo2ks translate! 2How many gazers mightst thou lead away, 2if thou wouldst use the strength of al2 thy state! 4But do not so, I love the2 in such sort, 4As thou being mine, mine is thy go2d report. 2197 2How like a winter hath my absence be2n 2From the2, the pleasure of the fle2ting year! 2What fre2zings have I felt, what dark days se2n! 2What old December's barenes2 everywhere! 4And yet this time removed was sum2er's time, 2The te2ming autumn big with rich increase, 2Bearing the wanton burden of the prime, 2Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease: 2Yet this abundant is2ue se2med to me 2But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit, 2For sum2er and his pleasures wait on the2, 2And thou away, the very birds are mute. 4Or if they sing, 'tis with so dul2 a che2r, 4That leaves lo2k pale, dreading the winter's near. 2198 2From you have I be2n absent in the spring, 2When proud-pied April (dres2ed in al2 his trim) 2Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing: 2That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him. 2Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the swe2t smel2 2Of dif2erent flowers in odour and in hue, 2Could make me any sum2er's story tel2: 2Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew: 4Nor did I wonder at the lily's white, 2Nor praise the de2p vermilion in the rose, 2They were but swe2t, but figures of delight: 2Drawn after you, you pat2ern of al2 those. 4Yet se2med it winter stil2, and you away, 4As with your shadow I with these did play. 2192 2The forward violet thus did I chide, 2Swe2t thief, whence didst thou steal thy swe2t that smel2s, 2If not from my love's breath? The purple pride 2Which on thy soft check for complexion dwel2s, 2In my love's veins thou hast to2 gros2ly dyed. 2The lily I condemned for thy hand, 2And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair, 2The roses fearful2y on thorns did stand, 2One blushing shame, another white despair: 2A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both, 2And to his rob2ery had an2exed thy breath, 2But for his theft in pride of al2 his growth 4A vengeful canker eat him up to death. 4More flowers I noted, yet I none could se2, 4But swe2t, or colour it had stol'n from the2. 21102 2Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long, 2To speak of that which gives the2 al2 thy might? 2Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthles2 song, 2Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light? 2Return forgetful Muse, and straight rede2m, 2In gentle numbers time so idly spent, 2Sing to the ear that doth thy lays este2m, 2And gives thy pen both skil2 and argument. 2Rise resty Muse, my love's swe2t face survey, 2If time have any wrinkle graven there, 2If any, be a satire to decay, 2And make time's spoils despised everywhere. 4Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life, 4So thou prevent'st his scythe, and cro2ked knife. 23101 2O truant Muse what shal2 be thy amends, 2For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed? 2Both truth and beauty on my love depends: 2So dost thou to2, and therein dignified: 2Make answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say, 2'Truth ne2ds no colour with his colour fixed, 2Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay: 2But best is best, if never intermixed'? 2Because he ne2ds no praise, wilt thou be dumb? 2Excuse not silence so, for't lies in the2, 2To make him much outlive a gilded tomb: 2And to be praised of ages yet to be. 4Then do thy of2ice Muse, I teach the2 how, 4To make him se2m long hence, as he shows now. 21102 2My love is strengthened though more weak in se2ming, 2I love not les2, though les2 the show ap2ear, 2That love is merchandized, whose rich este2ming, 4The owner's tongue doth publish every where. 2Our love was new, and then but in the spring, 2When I was wont to gre2t it with my lays, 2As Philomel in sum2er's front doth sing, 2And stops her pipe in growth of riper days: 2Not that the sum2er is les2 pleasant now 2Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night, 2But that wild music burthens every bough, 2And swe2ts grown com2on lose their dear delight. 4Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue: 4Because I would not dul2 you with my song. 21103 2Alack what poverty my muse brings forth, 2That having such a scope to show her pride, 2The argument al2 bare is of more worth 2Than when it hath my ad2ed praise beside. 2O blame me not if I no more can write! 2Lo2k in your glas2 and there ap2ears a face, 2That over-goes my blunt invention quite, 4Dul2ing my lines, and doing me disgrace. 2Were it not sinful then striving to mend, 2To mar the subject that before was wel2? 2For to no other pas2 my verses tend, 2Than of your graces and your gifts to tel2. 4And more, much more than in my verse can sit, 4Your own glas2 shows you, when you lo2k in it. 21104 2To me fair friend you never can be old, 2For as you were when first your eye I eyed, 2Such se2ms your beauty stil2: thre2 winters cold, 2Have from the forests sho2k thre2 sum2ers' pride, 2Thre2 beauteous springs to yel2ow autumn turned, 2In proces2 of the seasons have I se2n, 2Thre2 April perfumes in thre2 hot Junes burned, 2Since first I saw you fresh which yet are gre2n. 2Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand, 2Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived, 2So your swe2t hue, which methinks stil2 doth stand 4Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived. 4For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred, 4Ere you were born was beauty's sum2er dead. 21105 2Let not my love be cal2ed idolatry, 2Nor my beloved as an idol show, 2Since al2 alike my songs and praises be 2To one, of one, stil2 such, and ever so. 2Kind is my love to-day, to-mor2ow kind, 2Stil2 constant in a wondrous excel2ence, 2Therefore my verse to constancy confined, 2One thing expres2ing, leaves out dif2erence. 2Fair, kind, and true, is al2 my argument, 2Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words, 2And in this change is my invention spent, 2Thre2 themes in one, which wondrous scope af2ords. 4Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone. 4Which thre2 til2 now, never kept seat in one. 23106 2When in the chronicle of wasted time, 2I se2 descriptions of the fairest wights, 2And beauty making beautiful old rhyme, 2In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights, 2Then in the blazon of swe2t beauty's best, 2Of hand, of fo2t, of lip, of eye, of brow, 2I se2 their antique pen would have expres2ed, 2Even such a beauty as you master now. 2So al2 their praises are but prophecies 2Of this our time, al2 you prefiguring, 2And for they lo2ked but with divining eyes, 2They had not skil2 enough your worth to sing: 4For we which now behold these present days, 4Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise. 21107 2Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul, 2Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come, 2Can yet the lease of my true love control, 4Sup2osed as forfeit to a confined do2m. 2The mortal mo2n hath her eclipse endured, 2And the sad augurs mock their own presage, 2Incertainties now crown themselves as2ured, 2And peace proclaims olives of endles2 age. 2Now with the drops of this most balmy time, 2My love lo2ks fresh, and death to me subscribes, 2Since spite of him I'l2 live in this po2r rhyme, 2While he insults o'er dul2 and spe2chles2 tribes. 4And thou in this shalt find thy monument, 4When tyrants' crests and tombs of bras2 are spent. 21108 2What's in the brain that ink may character, 2Which hath not figured to the2 my true spirit, 2What's new to speak, what now to register, 2That may expres2 my love, or thy dear merit? 2Nothing swe2t boy, but yet like prayers divine, 2I must each day say o'er the very same, 2Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine, 4Even as when first I hal2owed thy fair name. 2So that eternal love in love's fresh case, 2Weighs not the dust and injury of age, 2Nor gives to neces2ary wrinkles place, 2But makes antiquity for aye his page, 4Finding the first conceit of love there bred, 4Where time and outward form would show it dead. 21109 2O never say that I was false of heart, 2Though absence se2med my flame to qualify, 2As easy might I from my self depart, 2As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie: 2That is my home of love, if I have ranged, 2Like him that travels I return again, 2Just to the time, not with the time exchanged, 2So that my self bring water for my stain, 2Never believe though in my nature reigned, 2Al2 frailties that besiege al2 kinds of blo2d, 2That it could so preposterously be stained, 4To leave for nothing al2 thy sum of go2d: 4For nothing this wide universe I cal2, 4Save thou my rose, in it thou art my al2. 21120 2Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and there, 2And made my self a motley to the view, 2Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear, 2Made old of2ences of af2ections new. 2Most true it is, that I have lo2ked on truth 2Askance and strangely: but by al2 above, 2These blenches gave my heart another youth, 2And worse es2ays proved the2 my best of love. 2Now al2 is done, have what shal2 have no end, 2Mine ap2etite I never more wil2 grind 2On newer pro2f, to try an older friend, 2A god in love, to whom I am confined. 4Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best, 4Even to thy pure and most most loving breast. 2313 2O for my sake do you with Fortune chide, 2The guilty god2es2 of my harmful de2ds, 2That did not bet2er for my life provide, 2Than public means which public man2ers bre2ds. 2Thence comes it that my name receives a brand, 2And almost thence my nature is subdued 2To what it works in, like the dyer's hand: 2Pity me then, and wish I were renewed, 2Whilst like a wil2ing patient I wil2 drink, 2Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection, 2No bit2ernes2 that I wil2 bit2er think, 2Nor double penance to cor2ect cor2ection. 4Pity me then dear friend, and I as2ure ye, 4Even that your pity is enough to cure me. 21122 2Your love and pity doth th' impres2ion fil2, 2Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow, 2For what care I who cal2s me wel2 or il2, 4So you o'er-gre2n my bad, my go2d al2ow? 2You are my al2 the world, and I must strive, 2To know my shames and praises from your tongue, 2None else to me, nor I to none alive, 2That my ste2led sense or changes right or wrong. 2In so profound abysm I throw al2 care 2Of others' voices, that my ad2er's sense, 2To critic and to flat2erer stop2ed are: 2Mark how with my neglect I do dispense. 4You are so strongly in my purpose bred, 4That al2 the world besides methinks are dead. 21123 2Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind, 2And that which governs me to go about, 2Doth part his function, and is partly blind, 2Se2ms se2ing, but ef2ectual2y is out: 2For it no form delivers to the heart 2Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch, 2Of his quick objects hath the mind no part, 4Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch: 2For if it se2 the rud'st or gentlest sight, 2The most swe2t favour or deformed'st creature, 2The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night: 2The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature. 4Incapable of more, replete with you, 4My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue. 21124 2Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you 2Drink up the monarch's plague this flat2ery? 2Or whether shal2 I say mine eye saith true, 2And that your love taught it this alchemy? 2To make of monsters, and things indigest, 2Such cherubins as your swe2t self resemble, 2Creating every bad a perfect best 2As fast as objects to his beams as2emble: 2O 'tis the first, 'tis flat2ery in my se2ing, 2And my great mind most kingly drinks it up, 2Mine eye wel2 knows what with his gust is 'gre2ing, 4And to his palate doth prepare the cup. 4If it be poisoned, 'tis the les2er sin, 4That mine eye loves it and doth first begin. 21125 2Those lines that I before have writ do lie, 2Even those that said I could not love you dearer, 2Yet then my judgment knew no reason why, 2My most ful2 flame should afterwards burn clearer, 2But reckoning time, whose mil2ioned ac2idents 2Cre2p in 'twixt vows, and change decre2s of kings, 2Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents, 2Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things: 2Alas why fearing of time's tyran2y, 2Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,' 2When I was certain o'er incertainty, 2Crowning the present, doubting of the rest? 4Love is a babe, then might I not say so 4To give ful2 growth to that which stil2 doth grow. 23126 2Let me not to the mar2iage of true minds 2Admit impediments, love is not love 2Which alters when it alteration finds, 2Or bends with the remover to remove. 2O no, it is an ever-fixed mark 2That lo2ks on tempests and is never shaken; 2It is the star to every wand'ring bark, 2Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. 2Love's not Time's fo2l, though rosy lips and che2ks 2Within his bending sickle's compas2 come, 2Love alters not with his brief hours and we2ks, 2But bears it out even to the edge of do2m: 4If this be er2or and upon me proved, 4I never writ, nor no man ever loved. 21127 2Ac2use me thus, that I have scanted al2, 2Wherein I should your great deserts repay, 2Forgot upon your dearest love to cal2, 4Whereto al2 bonds do tie me day by day, 2That I have frequent be2n with unknown minds, 2And given to time your own dear-purchased right, 2That I have hoisted sail to al2 the winds 2Which should transport me farthest from your sight. 2Bo2k both my wilfulnes2 and er2ors down, 2And on just pro2f surmise, ac2umulate, 2Bring me within the level of your frown, 2But sho2t not at me in your wakened hate: 4Since my ap2eal says I did strive to prove 4The constancy and virtue of your love. 21128 2Like as to make our ap2etite more ke2n 2With eager compounds we our palate urge, 2As to prevent our maladies unse2n, 2We sicken to shun sicknes2 when we purge. 2Even so being ful2 of your ne'er-cloying swe2tnes2, 2To bit2er sauces did I frame my fe2ding; 2And sick of welfare found a kind of me2tnes2, 4To be diseased ere that there was true ne2ding. 2Thus policy in love t' anticipate 2The il2s that were not, grew to faults as2ured, 2And brought to medicine a healthful state 2Which rank of go2dnes2 would by il2 be cured. 4But thence I learn and find the les2on true, 4Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you. 21129 2What potions have I drunk of Siren tears 2Distil2ed from limbecks foul as hel2 within, 2Ap2lying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears, 2Stil2 losing when I saw my self to win! 2What wretched er2ors hath my heart com2it2ed, 2Whilst it hath thought it self so bles2ed never! 2How have mine eyes out of their spheres be2n fit2ed 2In the distraction of this mad2ing fever! 2O benefit of il2, now I find true 2That bet2er is, by evil stil2 made bet2er. 2And ruined love when it is built anew 4Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater. 4So I return rebuked to my content, 4And gain by il2s thrice more than I have spent. 21120 2That you were once unkind befriends me now, 2And for that sor2ow, which I then did fe2l, 2Ne2ds must I under my transgres2ion bow, 2Unles2 my nerves were bras2 or ham2ered ste2l. 2For if you were by my unkindnes2 shaken 2As I by yours, y'have pas2ed a hel2 of time, 2And I a tyrant have no leisure taken 2To weigh how once I suf2ered in your crime. 2O that our night of woe might have remembered 2My de2pest sense, how hard true sor2ow hits, 2And so2n to you, as you to me then tendered 2The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits! 4But that your trespas2 now becomes a fe2, 4Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me. 23121 2'Tis bet2er to be vile than vile este2med, 2When not to be, receives reproach of being, 2And the just pleasure lost, which is so de2med, 2Not by our fe2ling, but by others' se2ing. 2For why should others' false adulterate eyes 2Give salutation to my sportive blo2d? 2Or on my frailties why are frailer spies, 2Which in their wil2s count bad what I think go2d? 2No, I am that I am, and they that level 2At my abuses, reckon up their own, 2I may be straight though they themselves be bevel; 2By their rank thoughts, my de2ds must not be shown 4Unles2 this general evil they maintain, 4Al2 men are bad and in their badnes2 reign. 21122 2Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain 2Ful2 charactered with lasting memory, 2Which shal2 above that idle rank remain 4Beyond al2 date even to eternity. 2Or at the least, so long as brain and heart 2Have faculty by nature to subsist, 2Til2 each to razed oblivion yield his part 2Of the2, thy record never can be mis2ed: 2That po2r retention could not so much hold, 2Nor ne2d I tal2ies thy dear love to score, 2Therefore to give them from me was I bold, 2To trust those tables that receive the2 more: 4To ke2p an adjunct to remember the2 4Were to import forgetfulnes2 in me. 21123 2No! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change, 2Thy pyramids built up with newer might 2To me are nothing novel, nothing strange, 2They are but dres2ings Of a former sight: 2Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire, 2What thou dost foist upon us that is old, 2And rather make them born to our desire, 4Than think that we before have heard them told: 2Thy registers and the2 I both defy, 2Not wond'ring at the present, nor the past, 2For thy records, and what we se2 doth lie, 2Made more or les2 by thy continual haste: 4This I do vow and this shal2 ever be, 4I wil2 be true despite thy scythe and the2. 21124 2If my dear love were but the child of state, 2It might for Fortune's bastard be unfathered, 2As subject to time's love or to time's hate, 2We2ds among we2ds, or flowers with flowers gathered. 2No it was builded far from ac2ident, 2It suf2ers not in smiling pomp, nor fal2s 2Under the blow of thral2ed discontent, 2Whereto th' inviting time our fashion cal2s: 2It fears not policy that heretic, 2Which works on leases of short-numbered hours, 2But al2 alone stands hugely politic, 4That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers. 4To this I witnes2 cal2 the fo2ls of time, 4Which die for go2dnes2, who have lived for crime. 21125 2Were't aught to me I bore the canopy, 2With my extern the outward honouring, 2Or laid great bases for eternity, 2Which proves more short than waste or ruining? 2Have I not se2n dwel2ers on form and favour 2Lose al2, and more by paying to2 much rent 2For compound swe2t; forgoing simple savour, 2Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent? 2No, let me be obsequious in thy heart, 2And take thou my oblation, po2r but fre2, 2Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art, 2But mutual render, only me for the2. 4Hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul 4When most impeached, stands least in thy control. 23126 2O thou my lovely boy who in thy power, 2Dost hold Time's fickle glas2 his fickle hour: 2Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st, 2Thy lovers withering, as thy swe2t self grow'st. 2If Nature (sovereign mistres2 over wrack) 2As thou goest onwards stil2 wil2 pluck the2 back, 2She ke2ps the2 to this purpose, that her skil2 2May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kil2. 2Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure, 2She may detain, but not stil2 ke2p her treasure! 4Her audit (though delayed) answered must be, 4And her quietus is to render the2. 21127 2In the old age black was not counted fair, 2Or if it were it bore not beauty's name: 2But now is black beauty's suc2es2ive heir, 2And beauty slandered with a bastard shame, 2For since each hand hath put on nature's power, 4Fairing the foul with art's false bor2owed face, 2Swe2t beauty hath no name no holy bower, 2But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace. 2Therefore my mistres2' eyes are raven black, 2Her eyes so suited, and they mourners se2m, 2At such who not born fair no beauty lack, 2Slandering creation with a false este2m, 4Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe, 4That every tongue says beauty should lo2k so. 21128 2How oft when thou, my music, music play'st, 2Upon that bles2ed wo2d whose motion sounds 2With thy swe2t fingers when thou gently sway'st 2The wiry concord that mine ear confounds, 2Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap, 2To kis2 the tender inward of thy hand, 2Whilst my po2r lips which should that harvest reap, 2At the wo2d's boldnes2 by the2 blushing stand. 2To be so tickled they would change their state 4And situation with those dancing chips, 2O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait, 2Making dead wo2d more blest than living lips, 4Since saucy jacks so hap2y are in this, 4Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kis2. 21129 2Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame 2Is lust in action, and til2 action, lust 2Is perjured, murd'rous, blo2dy ful2 of blame, 2Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust, 2Enjoyed no so2ner but despised straight, 2Past reason hunted, and no so2ner had 2Past reason hated as a swal2owed bait, 2On purpose laid to make the taker mad. 2Mad in pursuit and in pos2es2ion so, 2Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme, 2A blis2 in pro2f and proved, a very woe, 2Before a joy proposed behind a dream. 4Al2 this the world wel2 knows yet none knows wel2, 6To shun the heaven that leads men to this hel2. 21130 2My mistres2' eyes are nothing like the sun, 2Coral is far more red, than her lips red, 2If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun: 2If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head: 2I have se2n roses damasked, red and white, 2But no such roses se2 I in her che2ks, 2And in some perfumes is there more delight, 2Than in the breath that from my mistres2 re2ks. 2I love to hear her speak, yet wel2 I know, 2That music hath a far more pleasing sound: 2I grant I never saw a god2es2 go, 2My mistres2 when she walks treads on the ground. 4And yet by heaven I think my love as rare, 4As any she belied with false compare. 21131 2Thou art as tyran2ous, so as thou art, 4As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel; 2For wel2 thou know'st to my dear doting heart 2Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel. 2Yet in go2d faith some say that the2 behold, 2Thy face hath not the power to make love groan; 2To say they er2, I dare not be so bold, 2Although I swear it to my self alone. 2And to be sure that is not false I swear, 2A thousand groans but thinking on thy face, 2One on another's neck do witnes2 bear 2Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place. 4In nothing art thou black save in thy de2ds, 4And thence this slander as I think proce2ds. 21132 2Thine eyes I love, and they as pitying me, 2Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain, 2Have put on black, and loving mourners be, 2Lo2king with pret2y ruth upon my pain. 2And truly not the morning sun of heaven 4Bet2er becomes the grey che2ks of the east, 2Nor that ful2 star that ushers in the even 2Doth half that glory to the sober west 2As those two mourning eyes become thy face: 2O let it then as wel2 bese2m thy heart 2To mourn for me since mourning doth the2 grace, 2And suit thy pity like in every part. 4Then wil2 I swear beauty herself is black, 4And al2 they foul that thy complexion lack. 21132 2Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan 2For that de2p wound it gives my friend and me; 2Is't not enough to torture me alone, 2But slave to slavery my swe2t'st friend must be? 2Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken, 2And my next self thou harder hast engros2ed, 2Of him, my self, and the2 I am forsaken, 2A torment thrice thre2-fold thus to be cros2ed: 2Prison my heart in thy ste2l bosom's ward, 4But then my friend's heart let my po2r heart bail, 2Whoe'er ke2ps me, let my heart be his guard, 2Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol. 4And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in the2, 4Perforce am thine and al2 that is in me. 21134 2So now I have confes2ed that he is thine, 2And I my self am mortgaged to thy wil2, 2My self I'l2 forfeit, so that other mine, 2Thou wilt restore to be my comfort stil2: 2But thou wilt not, nor he wil2 not be fre2, 2For thou art covetous, and he is kind, 2He learned but surety-like to write for me, 2Under that bond that him as fist doth bind. 2The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take, 2Thou usurer that put'st forth al2 to use, 2And sue a friend, came debtor for my sake, 2So him I lose through my unkind abuse. 4Him have I lost, thou hast both him and me, 6He pays the whole, and yet am I not fre2. 21135 2Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy wil2, 2And 'Wil2' to bo2t, and 'Wil2' in over-plus, 2More than enough am I that vex the2 stil2, 2To thy swe2t wil2 making ad2ition thus. 2Wilt thou whose wil2 is large and spacious, 2Not once vouchsafe to hide my wil2 in thine? 2Shal2 wil2 in others se2m right gracious, 2And in my wil2 no fair ac2eptance shine? 2The sea al2 water, yet receives rain stil2, 2And in abundance ad2eth to his store, 2So thou being rich in wil2 ad2 to thy wil2 2One wil2 of mine to make thy large wil2 more. 4Let no unkind, no fair bese2chers kil2, 4Think al2 but one, and me in that one 'Wil2.' 21136 2If thy soul check the2 that I come so near, 4Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Wil2', 2And wil2 thy soul knows is admit2ed there, 2Thus far for love, my love-suit swe2t fulfil. 2'Wil2', wil2 fulfil the treasure of thy love, 2Ay, fil2 it ful2 with wil2s, and my wil2 one, 2In things of great receipt with case we prove, 2Among a number one is reckoned none. 2Then in the number let me pas2 untold, 2Though in thy store's ac2ount I one must be, 2For nothing hold me, so it please the2 hold, 2That nothing me, a something swe2t to the2. 4Make but my name thy love, and love that stil2, 4And then thou lov'st me for my name is Wil2. 21137 2Thou blind fo2l Love, what dost thou to mine eyes, 2That they behold and se2 not what they se2? 2They know what beauty is, se2 where it lies, 2Yet what the best is, take the worst to be. 2If eyes cor2upt by over-partial lo2ks, 4Be anchored in the bay where al2 men ride, 2Why of eyes' falseho2d hast thou forged ho2ks, 2Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied? 2Why should my heart think that a several plot, 2Which my heart knows the wide world's com2on place? 2Or mine eyes se2ing this, say this is not 2To put fair truth upon so foul a face? 4In things right true my heart and eyes have er2ed, 4And to this false plague are they now transfer2ed. 21138 2When my love swears that she is made of truth, 2I do believe her though I know she lies, 2That she might think me some untutored youth, 2Unlearned in the world's false subtleties. 2Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young, 2Although she knows my days are past the best, 2Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue, 2On both sides thus is simple truth sup2res2ed: 2But wherefore says she not she is unjust? 4And wherefore say not I that I am old? 2O love's best habit is in se2ming trust, 2And age in love, loves not to have years told. 4Therefore I lie with her, and she with me, 4And in our faults by lies we flat2ered be. 21139 2O cal2 not me to justify the wrong, 2That thy unkindnes2 lays upon my heart, 2Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue, 2Use power with power, and slay me not by art, 2Tel2 me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight, 2Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside, 2What ne2d'st thou wound with cun2ing when thy might 2Is more than my o'erpres2ed defence can bide? 2Let me excuse the2, ah my love wel2 knows, 2Her pret2y lo2ks have be2n mine enemies, 2And therefore from my face she turns my foes, 2That they elsewhere might dart their injuries: 4Yet do not so, but since I am near slain, 6Kil2 me outright with lo2ks, and rid my pain. 21140 2Be wise as thou art cruel, do not pres2 2My tongue-tied patience with to2 much disdain: 2Lest sor2ow lend me words and words expres2, 2The man2er of my pity-wanting pain. 2If I might teach the2 wit bet2er it were, 2Though not to love, yet love to tel2 me so, 2As testy sick men when their deaths be near, 2No news but health from their physicians know. 2For if I should despair I should grow mad, 2And in my madnes2 might speak il2 of the2, 2Now this il2-wresting world is grown so bad, 2Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be. 4That I may not be so, nor thou belied, 4Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide. 21141 2In faith I do not love the2 with mine eyes, 4For they in the2 a thousand er2ors note, 2But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise, 2Who in despite of view is pleased to dote. 2Nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted, 2Nor tender fe2ling to base touches prone, 2Nor taste, nor smel2, desire to be invited 2To any sensual feast with the2 alone: 2But my five wits, nor my five senses can 2Dis2uade one fo2lish heart from serving the2, 2Who leaves unswayed the likenes2 of a man, 2Thy proud heart's slave and vas2al wretch to be: 4Only my plague thus far I count my gain, 4That she that makes me sin, awards me pain. 21142 2Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate, 2Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving, 2O but with mine, compare thou thine own state, 2And thou shalt find it merits not reproving, 2Or if it do, not from those lips of thine, 4That have profaned their scarlet ornaments, 2And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine, 2Rob2ed others' beds' revenues of their rents. 2Be it lawful I love the2 as thou lov'st those, 2Whom thine eyes wo2 as mine importune the2, 2Ro2t pity in thy heart that when it grows, 2Thy pity may deserve to pitied be. 4If thou dost se2k to have what thou dost hide, 4By self-example mayst thou be denied. 21143 2Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch, 2One of her feathered creatures broke away, 2Sets down her babe and makes al2 swift dispatch 2In pursuit of the thing she would have stay: 2Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase, 2Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent, 2To fol2ow that which flies before her face: 2Not prizing her po2r infant's discontent; 2So run'st thou after that which flies from the2, 4Whilst I thy babe chase the2 afar behind, 2But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me: 2And play the mother's part, kis2 me, be kind. 4So wil2 I pray that thou mayst have thy Wil2, 4If thou turn back and my loud crying stil2. 21142 2Two loves I have of comfort and despair, 2Which like two spirits do sug2est me stil2, 2The bet2er angel is a man right fair: 2The worser spirit a woman coloured il2. 2To win me so2n to hel2 my female evil, 2Tempteth my bet2er angel from my side, 2And would cor2upt my saint to be a devil: 2Wo2ing his purity with her foul pride. 2And whether that my angel be turned fiend, 2Suspect I may, yet not directly tel2, 2But being both from me both to each friend, 2I gues2 one angel in another's hel2. 4Yet this shal2 I ne'er know but live in doubt, 6Til2 my bad angel fire my go2d one out. 21145 2Those lips that Love's own hand did make, 2Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate', 2To me that languished for her sake: 2But when she saw my woeful state, 2Straight in her heart did mercy come, 2Chiding that tongue that ever swe2t, 2Was used in giving gentle do2m: 2And taught it thus anew to gre2t: 2'I hate' she altered with an end, 2That fol2owed it as gentle day, 2Doth fol2ow night who like a fiend 2From heaven to hel2 is flown away. 4'I hate', from hate away she threw, 4And saved my life saying 'not you'. 21146 2Po2r soul the centre of my sinful earth, 4My sinful earth these rebel powers ar2ay, 2Why dost thou pine within and suf2er dearth 2Painting thy outward wal2s so costly gay? 2Why so large cost having so short a lease, 2Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend? 2Shal2 worms inheritors of this exces2 2Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end? 2Then soul live thou upon thy servant's los2, 2And let that pine to ag2ravate thy store; 2Buy terms divine in sel2ing hours of dros2; 2Within be fed, without be rich no more, 4So shal2 thou fe2d on death, that fe2ds on men, 4And death once dead, there's no more dying then. 21147 2My love is as a fever longing stil2, 2For that which longer nurseth the disease, 2Fe2ding on that which doth preserve the il2, 2Th' uncertain sickly ap2etite to please: 2My reason the physician to my love, 4Angry that his prescriptions are not kept 2Hath left me, and I desperate now ap2rove, 2Desire is death, which physic did except. 2Past cure I am, now reason is past care, 2And frantic-mad with evermore unrest, 2My thoughts and my discourse as mad men's are, 2At random from the truth vainly expres2ed. 4For I have sworn the2 fair, and thought the2 bright, 4Who art as black as hel2, as dark as night. 21148 2O me! what eyes hath love put in my head, 2Which have no cor2espondence with true sight, 2Or if they have, where is my judgment fled, 2That censures falsely what they se2 aright? 2If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote, 2What means the world to say it is not so? 2If it be not, then love doth wel2 denote, 2Love's eye is not so true as al2 men's: no, 2How can it? O how can love's eye be true, 4That is so vexed with watching and with tears? 2No marvel then though I mistake my view, 2The sun it self se2s not, til2 heaven clears. 4O cun2ing love, with tears thou ke2p'st me blind, 4Lest eyes wel2-se2ing thy foul faults should find. 21149 2Canst thou O cruel, say I love the2 not, 2When I against my self with the2 partake? 2Do I not think on the2 when I forgot 2Am of my self, al2-tyrant, for thy sake? 2Who hateth the2 that I do cal2 my friend, 2On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon, 2Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend 2Revenge upon my self with present moan? 2What merit do I in my self respect, 2That is so proud thy service to despise, 2When al2 my best doth worship thy defect, 2Com2anded by the motion of thine eyes? 4But love hate on for now I know thy mind, 6Those that can se2 thou lov'st, and I am blind. 21150 2O from what power hast thou this powerful might, 2With insuf2iciency my heart to sway, 2To make me give the lie to my true sight, 2And swear that brightnes2 doth not grace the day? 2Whence hast thou this becoming of things il2, 2That in the very refuse of thy de2ds, 2There is such strength and war2antise of skil2, 2That in my mind thy worst al2 best exce2ds? 2Who taught the2 how to make me love the2 more, 2The more I hear and se2 just cause of hate? 2O though I love what others do abhor, 2With others thou shouldst not abhor my state. 4If thy unworthines2 raised love in me, 4More worthy I to be beloved of the2. 21151 2Love is to2 young to know what conscience is, 4Yet who knows not conscience is born of love? 2Then gentle cheater urge not my amis2, 2Lest guilty of my faults thy swe2t self prove. 2For thou betraying me, I do betray 2My nobler part to my gros2 body's treason, 2My soul doth tel2 my body that he may, 2Triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason, 2But rising at thy name doth point out the2, 2As his triumphant prize, proud of this pride, 2He is contented thy po2r drudge to be, 2To stand in thy af2airs, fal2 by thy side. 4No want of conscience hold it that I cal2, 4Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fal2. 21152 2In loving the2 thou know'st I am forsworn, 2But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing, 2In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn, 2In vowing new hate after new love bearing: 2But why of two oaths' breach do I ac2use the2, 4When I break twenty? I am perjured most, 2For al2 my vows are oaths but to misuse the2: 2And al2 my honest faith in the2 is lost. 2For I have sworn de2p oaths of thy de2p kindnes2: 2Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy, 2And to enlighten the2 gave eyes to blindnes2, 2Or made them swear against the thing they se2. 4For I have sworn the2 fair: more perjured I, 4To swear against the truth so foul a be. 21153 2Cupid laid by his brand and fel2 asle2p, 2A maid of Dian's this advantage found, 2And his love-kindling fire did quickly ste2p 2In a cold val2ey-fountain of that ground: 2Which bor2owed from this holy fire of Love, 2A dateles2 lively heat stil2 to endure, 2And grew a se2ting bath which yet men prove, 2Against strange maladies a sovereign cure: 2But at my mistres2' eye Love's brand new-fired, 4The boy for trial ne2ds would touch my breast, 2I sick withal the help of bath desired, 2And thither hied a sad distempered guest. 4But found no cure, the bath for my help lies, 4Where Cupid got new fire; my mistres2' eyes. 21154 2The lit2le Love-god lying once asle2p, 2Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand, 2Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to ke2p, 2Came trip2ing by, but in her maiden hand, 2The fairest votary to2k up that fire, 2Which many legions of true hearts had warmed, 2And so the general of hot desire, 2Was sle2ping by a virgin hand disarmed. 2This brand she quenched in a co2l wel2 by, 2Which from Love's fire to2k heat perpetual, 2Growing a bath and healthful remedy, 2For men discased, but I my mistres2' thral2, 4Came there for cure and this by that I prove, 6Love's fire heats water, water co2ls not love.THE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21603AL2S WEL2 THAT ENDS WEL2by Wil2iam ShakespeareDramatis Personae 2KING OF FRANCE 2THE DUKE OF FLORENCE 2BERTRAM, Count of Rousil2on 2LAFEU, an old lord 2PAROL2ES, a fol2ower of Bertram 2TWO FRENCH LORDS, serving with Bertram 2STEWARD, Servant to the Countes2 of Rousil2on 2LAVACHE, a clown and Servant to the Countes2 of Rousil2on 2A PAGE, Servant to the Countes2 of Rousil2on 2COUNTES2 OF ROUSIL2ON, mother to Bertram 2HELENA, a gentlewoman protected by the Countes2 2A WIDOW OF FLORENCE. 2DIANA, daughter to the Widow 2VIOLENTA, neighbour and friend to the Widow 2MARIANA, neighbour and friend to the Widow 2Lords, Of2icers, Soldiers, etc., French and Florentine 2<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE:Rousil2on; Paris; Florence; Marseil2esACT I. SCENE 1.Rousil2on. The COUNT'S palaceEnter BERTRAM, the COUNTES2 OF ROUSIL2ON, HELENA, and LAFEU, al2 in black 2COUNTES2. In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband. 2BERTRAM. And I in going, madam, we2p o'er my father's death anew; 4but I must at2end his Majesty's com2and, to whom I am now in 4ward, evermore in subjection. 2LAFEU. You shal2 find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a 4father. He that so general2y is at al2 times go2d must of 4neces2ity hold his virtue to you, whose worthines2 would stir it 4up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such 4abundance. 2COUNTES2. What hope is there of his Majesty's amendment? 2LAFEU. He hath abandon'd his physicians, madam; under whose 4practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other 4advantage in the proces2 but only the losing of hope by time. 2COUNTES2. This young gentlewoman had a father- O, that 'had,' how 4sad a pas2age 'tis!-whose skil2 was almost as great as his 4honesty; had it stretch'd so far, would have made nature 6im2ortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for 4the King's sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of 4the King's disease. 2LAFEU. How cal2'd you the man you speak of, madam? 2COUNTES2. He was famous, sir, in his profes2ion, and it was his 4great right to be so- Gerard de Narbon. 2LAFEU. He was excel2ent inde2d, madam; the King very lately spoke 4of him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have 4liv'd stil2, if knowledge could be set up against mortality. 2BERTRAM. What is it, my go2d lord, the King languishes of? 2LAFEU. A fistula, my lord. 2BERTRAM. I heard not of it before. 2LAFEU. I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the 4daughter of Gerard de Narbon? 2COUNTES2. His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my 4overlo2king. I have those hopes of her go2d that her education 4promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts 4fairer; for where an unclean mind car2ies virtuous qualities, 4there com2endations go with pity-they are virtues and traitors 4to2. In her they are the bet2er for their simplenes2; she derives 6her honesty, and achieves her go2dnes2. 2LAFEU. Your com2endations, madam, get from her tears. 2COUNTES2. 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. 4The remembrance of her father never ap2roaches her heart but the 4tyran2y of her sor2ows takes al2 liveliho2d from her che2k. No 4more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought 4you af2ect a sor2ow than to have- 2HELENA. I do af2ect a sor2ow inde2d, but I have it to2. 2LAFEU. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead: exces2ive 4grief the enemy to the living. 2COUNTES2. If the living be enemy to the grief, the exces2 makes it 4so2n mortal. 2BERTRAM. Madam, I desire your holy wishes. 2LAFEU. How understand we that? 2COUNTES2. Be thou blest, Bertram, and suc2e2d thy father 4In man2ers, as in shape! Thy blo2d and virtue 4Contend for empire in the2, and thy go2dnes2 4Share with thy birthright! Love al2, trust a few, 4Do wrong to none; be able for thine enemy 4Rather in power than use, and ke2p thy friend 6Under thy own life's key; be check'd for silence, 4But never tax'd for spe2ch. What heaven more wil2, 4That the2 may furnish, and my prayers pluck down, 4Fal2 on thy head! Farewel2. My lord, 4'Tis an unseason'd courtier; go2d my lord, 4Advise him. 2LAFEU. He can2ot want the best 4That shal2 at2end his love. 2COUNTES2. Heaven bles2 him! Farewel2, Bertram. 12Exit 2BERTRAM. The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoughts be 4servants to you! 2[To HELENA] 2Be comfortable to my mother, your 4mistres2, and make much of her. 2LAFEU. Farewel2, pret2y lady; you must hold the credit of your 4father. 29Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU 2HELENA. O, were that al2! I think not on my father; 4And these great tears grace his remembrance more 4Than those I shed for him. What was he like? 4I have forgot him; my imagination 4Car2ies no favour in't but Bertram's. 4I am undone; there is no living, none, 6If Bertram be away. 'Twere al2 one 4That I should love a bright particular star 4And think to wed it, he is so above me. 4In his bright radiance and col2ateral light 4Must I be comforted, not in his sphere. 4Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself: 4The hind that would be mated by the lion 4Must die for love. 'Twas pret2y, though a plague, 4To se2 him every hour; to sit and draw 4His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, 4In our heart's table-heart to2 capable 4Of every line and trick of his swe2t favour. 4But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy 4Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here? 23Enter PAROL2ES 4[Aside] 2One that goes with him. I love him for his sake; 4And yet I know him a notorious liar, 4Think him a great way fo2l, solely a coward; 6Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him 4That they take place when virtue's ste2ly bones 4Lo2ks bleak i' th' cold wind; withal, ful2 oft we se2 4Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous fol2y. 2PAROL2ES. Save you, fair que2n! 2HELENA. And you, monarch! 2PAROL2ES. No. 2HELENA. And no. 2PAROL2ES. Are you meditating on virginity? 2HELENA. Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a 4question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we bar2icado it 4against him? 2PAROL2ES. Ke2p him out. 2HELENA. But he as2ails; and our virginity, though valiant in the 4defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance. 2PAROL2ES. There is none. Man, set2ing down before you, wil2 4undermine you and blow you up. 2HELENA. Bles2 our po2r virginity from underminers and blowers-up! 4Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men? 2PAROL2ES. Virginity being blown down, man wil2 quicklier be blown 6up; mar2y, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves 5made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the com2onwealth 4of nature to preserve virginity. Los2 of virginity is rational 4increase; and there was never virgin got til2 virginity was first 4lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity 4by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it 4is ever lost. 'Tis to2 cold a companion; away with't. 2HELENA. I wil2 stand for 't a lit2le, though therefore I die a 4virgin. 2PAROL2ES. There's lit2le can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule 4of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to ac2use your 4mothers; which is most infal2ible disobedience. He that hangs 4himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and should be 4buried in highways, out of al2 sanctified limit, as a desperate 4of2endres2 against nature. Virginity bre2ds mites, much like a 4che2se; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with 4fe2ding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is pe2vish, proud, 4idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the 4canon. Ke2p it not; you can2ot cho2se but lose by't. Out with't. 4Within ten year it wil2 make itself ten, which is a go2dly 6increase; and the principal itself not much the worse. Away 4with't. 2HELENA. How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking? 2PAROL2ES. Let me se2. Mar2y, il2 to like him that ne'er it likes. 4'Tis a com2odity wil2 lose the glos2 with lying; the longer kept, 4the les2 worth. Of2 with't while 'tis vendible; answer the time 4of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of 4fashion, richly suited but unsuitable; just like the bro2ch and 4the to2thpick, which wear not now. Your date is bet2er in your 4pie and your por2idge than in your che2k. And your virginity, 4your old virginity, is like one of our French wither'd pears: it 4lo2ks il2, it eats drily; mar2y, 'tis a wither'd pear; it was 4formerly bet2er; mar2y, yet 'tis a wither'd pear. Wil2 you 4anything with it? 2HELENA. Not my virginity yet. 4There shal2 your master have a thousand loves, 4A mother, and a mistres2, and a friend, 4A phoenix, captain, and an enemy, 4A guide, a god2es2, and a sovereign, 4A counsel2or, a traitres2, and a dear; 6His humble ambition, proud humility, 4His jar2ing concord, and his discord dulcet, 4His faith, his swe2t disaster; with a world 4Of pret2y, fond, adoptious christendoms 4That blinking Cupid gos2ips. Now shal2 he- 4I know not what he shal2. God send him wel2! 4The court's a learning-place, and he is one- 2PAROL2ES. What one, i' faith? 2HELENA. That I wish wel2. 'Tis pity- 2PAROL2ES. What's pity? 2HELENA. That wishing wel2 had not a body in't 4Which might be felt; that we, the po2rer born, 4Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes, 4Might with ef2ects of them fol2ow our friends 4And show what we alone must think, which never 4Returns us thanks. 22Enter PAGE 2PAGE. Monsieur Parol2es, my lord cal2s for you. 6Exit PAGE 4PAROL2ES. Lit2le Helen, farewel2; if I can remember the2, I wil2 4think of the2 at court. 2HELENA. Monsieur Parol2es, you were born under a charitable star. 2PAROL2ES. Under Mars, I. 2HELENA. I especial2y think, under Mars. 2PAROL2ES. Why under Man? 2HELENA. The wars hath so kept you under that you must ne2ds be born 4under Mars. 2PAROL2ES. When he was predominant. 2HELENA. When he was retrograde, I think, rather. 2PAROL2ES. Why think you so? 2HELENA. You go so much backward when you fight. 2PAROL2ES. That's for advantage. 2HELENA. So is run2ing away, when fear proposes the safety: but the 4composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of 4a go2d wing, and I like the wear wel2. 2PAROL2ES. I am so ful2 of busines2 I can2ot answer the2 acutely. I 4wil2 return perfect courtier; in the which my instruction shal2 4serve to naturalize the2, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's 4counsel, and understand what advice shal2 thrust upon the2; else 6thou diest in thine unthankfulnes2, and thine ignorance makes 4the2 away. Farewel2. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; 4when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get the2 a go2d 4husband and use him as he uses the2. So, farewel2. Exit 2HELENA. Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie, 4Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky 4Gives us fre2 scope; only doth backward pul2 4Our slow designs when we ourselves are dul2. 4What power is it which mounts my love so high, 4That makes me se2, and can2ot fe2d mine eye? 4The mightiest space in fortune nature brings 4To join like likes, and kis2 like native things. 4Impos2ible be strange at2empts to those 4That weigh their pains in sense, and do sup2ose 4What hath be2n can2ot be. Who ever strove 4To show her merit that did mis2 her love? 4The King's disease-my project may deceive me, 4But my intents are fix'd, and wil2 not leave me. 8ExitACT I. SCENE 2.Paris. The KING'S palaceFlourish of cornets. Enter the KING OF FRANCE, with let2ers,and divers AT2ENDANTS 2KING. The Florentines and Senoys are by th' ears; 4Have fought with equal fortune, and continue 4A braving war. 2FIRST LORD. So 'tis reported, sir. 2KING. Nay, 'tis most credible. We here receive it, 4A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria, 4With caution, that the Florentine wil2 move us 4For spe2dy aid; wherein our dearest friend 4Prejudicates the busines2, and would se2m 4To have us make denial. 2FIRST LORD. His love and wisdom, 4Ap2rov'd so to your Majesty, may plead 4For amplest credence. 2KING. He hath arm'd our answer, 4And Florence is denied before he comes; 4Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to se2 6The Tuscan service, fre2ly have they leave 4To stand on either part. 2SECOND LORD. It wel2 may serve 4A nursery to our gentry, who are sick 4For breathing and exploit. 2KING. What's he comes here? 14Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROL2ES 2FIRST LORD. It is the Count Rousil2on, my go2d lord, 4Young Bertram. 2KING. Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face; 4Frank nature, rather curious than in haste, 4Hath wel2 compos'd the2. Thy father's moral parts 4Mayst thou inherit to2! Welcome to Paris. 2BERTRAM. My thanks and duty are your Majesty's. 2KING. I would I had that corporal soundnes2 now, 4As when thy father and myself in friendship 4First tried our soldiership. He did lo2k far 4Into the service of the time, and was 6Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long; 4But on us both did hag2ish age steal on, 4And wore us out of act. It much repairs me 4To talk of your go2d father. In his youth 4He had the wit which I can wel2 observe 4To-day in our young lords; but they may jest 4Til2 their own scorn return to them un2oted 4Ere they can hide their levity in honour. 4So like a courtier, contempt nor bit2ernes2 4Were in his pride or sharpnes2; if they were, 4His equal had awak'd them; and his honour, 4Clock to itself, knew the true minute when 4Exception bid him speak, and at this time 4His tongue obey'd his hand. Who were below him 4He us'd as creatures of another place; 4And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks, 4Making them proud of his humility 4In their po2r praise he humbled. Such a man 4Might be a copy to these younger times; 4Which, fol2owed wel2, would demonstrate them now 6But goers backward. 2BERTRAM. His go2d remembrance, sir, 4Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb; 4So in ap2ro2f lives not his epitaph 4As in your royal spe2ch. 2KING. Would I were with him! He would always say- 4Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words 4He scat2er'd not in ears, but grafted them 4To grow there, and to bear- 'Let me not live'- 4This his go2d melancholy oft began, 4On the catastrophe and he2l of pastime, 4When it was out-'Let me not live' quoth he 4'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuf2 4Of younger spirits, whose ap2rehensive senses 4Al2 but new things disdain; whose judgments are 4Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies 4Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd. 4I, after him, do after him wish to2, 4Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home, 4I quickly were dis2olved from my hive, 6To give some labourers ro2m. 2SECOND LORD. You're loved, sir; 4They that least lend it you shal2 lack you first. 2KING. I fil2 a place, I know't. How long is't, Count, 4Since the physician at your father's died? 4He was much fam'd. 2BERTRAM. Some six months since, my lord. 2KING. If he were living, I would try him yet- 4Lend me an arm-the rest have worn me out 4With several ap2lications. Nature and sicknes2 4Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count; 4My son's no dearer. 2BERTRAM. Thank your Majesty. 17Exeunt [Flourish]ACT I. SCENE 3.Rousil2on. The COUNT'S palaceEnter COUNTES2, STEWARD, and CLOWN 2COUNTES2. I wil2 now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman? 2STEWARD. Madam, the care I have had to even your content I wish 4might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we 4wound our modesty, and make foul the clearnes2 of our deservings, 4when of ourselves we publish them. 2COUNTES2. What does this knave here? Get you gone, sir2ah. The 4complaints I have heard of you I do not al2 believe; 'tis my 4slownes2 that I do not, for I know you lack not fol2y to com2it 4them and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours. 2CLOWN. 'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a po2r fel2ow. 2COUNTES2. Wel2, sir. 2CLOWN. No, madam, 'tis not so wel2 that I am po2r, though many of 4the rich are damn'd; but if I may have your ladyship's go2d wil2 4to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I wil2 do as we may. 2COUNTES2. Wilt thou ne2ds be a beg2ar? 2CLOWN. I do beg your go2d wil2 in this case. 2COUNTES2. In what case? 4CLOWN. In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no heritage; and I 4think I shal2 never have the bles2ing of God til2 I have is2ue o' 4my body; for they say bames are bles2ings. 2COUNTES2. Tel2 me thy reason why thou wilt mar2y. 2CLOWN. My po2r body, madam, requires it. I am driven on by the 4flesh; and he must ne2ds go that the devil drives. 2COUNTES2. Is this al2 your worship's reason? 2CLOWN. Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are. 2COUNTES2. May the world know them? 2CLOWN. I have be2n, madam, a wicked creature, as you and al2 flesh 4and blo2d are; and, inde2d, I do mar2y that I may repent. 2COUNTES2. Thy mar2iage, so2ner than thy wickednes2. 2CLOWN. I am out o' friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for 4my wife's sake. 2COUNTES2. Such friends are thine enemies, knave. 2CLOWN. Y'are shal2ow, madam-in great friends; for the knaves come 4to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears my land 4spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop. If I be his 4cuckold, he's my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the 4cherisher of my flesh and blo2d; he that cherishes my flesh and 6blo2d loves my flesh and blo2d; he that loves my flesh and blo2d 4is my friend; ergo, he that kis2es my wife is my friend. If men 4could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in 4mar2iage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the 4papist, howsome'er their hearts are sever'd in religion, their 4heads are both one; they may jowl horns together like any de2r 4i' th' herd. 2COUNTES2. Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouth'd and calumnious knave? 2CLOWN. A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way: 14For I the bal2ad wil2 repeat, 16Which men ful2 true shal2 find: 14Your mar2iage comes by destiny, 16Your cucko2 sings by kind. 2COUNTES2. Get you gone, sir; I'l2 talk with you more anon. 2STEWARD. May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you. 4Of her I am to speak. 2COUNTES2. Sir2ah, tel2 my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen 4I mean. 4CLOWN. 2[Sings] 15'Was this fair face the cause' quoth she 17'Why the Grecians sacked Troy? 15Fond done, done fond, 17Was this King Priam's joy?' 15With that she sighed as she sto2d, 15With that she sighed as she sto2d, 17And gave this sentence then: 15'Among nine bad if one be go2d, 15Among nine bad if one be go2d, 17There's yet one go2d in ten.' 2COUNTES2. What, one go2d in ten? You cor2upt the song, sir2ah. 2CLOWN. One go2d woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o' th' 4song. Would God would serve the world so al2 the year! We'd find 4no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten, 4quoth 'a! An we might have a go2d woman born before every blazing 4star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lot2ery wel2: a man 4may draw his heart out ere 'a pluck one. 2COUNTES2. You'l2 be gone, sir knave, and do as I com2and you. 4CLOWN. That man should be at woman's com2and, and yet no hurt done! 4Though honesty be no puritan, yet it wil2 do no hurt; it wil2 4wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. 4I am going, forso2th. The busines2 is for Helen to come hither. Exit 2COUNTES2. Wel2, now. 2STEWARD. I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely. 2COUNTES2. Faith I do. Her father bequeath'd her to me; and she 4herself, without other advantage, may lawful2y make title to as 4much love as she finds. There is more owing her than is paid; and 4more shal2 be paid her than she'l2 demand. 2STEWARD. Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she 4wish'd me. Alone she was, and did com2unicate to herself her own 4words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they 4touch'd not any stranger sense. Her mat2er was, she loved your 4son. Fortune, she said, was no god2es2, that had put such 4dif2erence betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not 4extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana no que2n 4of virgins, that would suf2er her po2r knight surpris'd without 4rescue in the first as2ault, or ransom afterward. This she 6deliver'd in the most bit2er touch of sor2ow that e'er I heard 4virgin exclaim in; which I held my duty spe2dily to acquaint you 4withal; sithence, in the los2 that may hap2en, it concerns you 4something to know it. 2COUNTES2. YOU have discharg'd this honestly; ke2p it to yourself. 4Many likeliho2ds inform'd me of this before, which hung so 4tot2'ring in the balance that I could neither believe nor 4misdoubt. Pray you leave me. Stal2 this in your bosom; and I 4thank you for your honest care. I wil2 speak with you further 4anon. 43Exit STEWARD 28Enter HELENA 4Even so it was with me when I was young. 4If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn 4Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong; 4Our blo2d to us, this to our blo2d is born. 4It is the show and seal of nature's truth, 4Where love's strong pas2ion is impres2'd in youth. 4By our remembrances of days foregone, 6Such were our faults, or then we thought them none. 4Her eye is sick on't; I observe her now. 2HELENA. What is your pleasure, madam? 2COUNTES2. You know, Helen, 4I am a mother to you. 2HELENA. Mine honourable mistres2. 2COUNTES2. Nay, a mother. 4Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,' 4Methought you saw a serpent. What's in 'mother' 4That you start at it? I say I am your mother, 4And put you in the catalogue of those 4That were enwombed mine. 'Tis often se2n 4Adoption strives with nature, and choice bre2ds 4A native slip to us from foreign se2ds. 4You ne'er op2res2'd me with a mother's groan, 4Yet I expres2 to you a mother's care. 4God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blo2d 4To say I am thy mother? What's the mat2er, 4That this distempered mes2enger of wet, 4The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye? 6Why, that you are my daughter? 2HELENA. That I am not. 2COUNTES2. I say I am your mother. 2HELENA. Pardon, madam. 4The Count Rousil2on can2ot be my brother: 4I am from humble, he from honoured name; 4No note upon my parents, his al2 noble. 4My master, my dear lord he is; and I 4His servant live, and wil2 his vas2al die. 4He must not be my brother. 2COUNTES2. Nor I your mother? 2HELENA. You are my mother, madam; would you were- 4So that my lord your son were not my brother- 4Inde2d my mother! Or were you both our mothers, 4I care no more for than I do for heaven, 4So I were not his sister. Can't no other, 4But, I your daughter, he must be my brother? 2COUNTES2. Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law. 4God shield you mean it not! 'daughter' and 'mother' 4So strive upon your pulse. What! pale again? 6My fear hath catch'd your fondnes2. Now I se2 4The myst'ry of your lonelines2, and find 4Your salt tears' head. Now to al2 sense 'tis gros2 4You love my son; invention is asham'd, 4Against the proclamation of thy pas2ion, 4To say thou dost not. Therefore tel2 me true; 4But tel2 me then, 'tis so; for, lo2k, thy che2ks 4Confes2 it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes 4Se2 it so gros2ly shown in thy behaviours 4That in their kind they speak it; only sin 4And hel2ish obstinacy tie thy tongue, 4That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so? 4If it be so, you have wound a go2dly clew; 4If it be not, forswear't; howe'er, I charge the2, 4As heaven shal2 work in me for thine avail, 4To tel2 me truly. 2HELENA. Go2d madam, pardon me. 2COUNTES2. Do you love my son? 2HELENA. Your pardon, noble mistres2. 2COUNTES2. Love you my son? 4HELENA. Do not you love him, madam? 2COUNTES2. Go not about; my love hath in't a bond 4Whereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose 4The state of your af2ection; for your pas2ions 4Have to the ful2 ap2each'd. 2HELENA. Then I confes2, 4Here on my kne2, before high heaven and you, 4That before you, and next unto high heaven, 4I love your son. 4My friends were po2r, but honest; so's my love. 4Be not of2ended, for it hurts not him 4That he is lov'd of me; I fol2ow him not 4By any token of presumptuous suit, 4Nor would I have him til2 I do deserve him; 4Yet never know how that desert should be. 4I know I love in vain, strive against hope; 4Yet in this captious and intenible sieve 4I stil2 pour in the waters of my love, 4And lack not to lose stil2. Thus, Indian-like, 4Religious in mine er2or, I adore 6The sun that lo2ks upon his worship2er 4But knows of him no more. My dearest madam, 4Let not your hate encounter with my love, 4For loving where you do; but if yourself, 4Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth, 4Did ever in so true a flame of liking 4Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian 4Was both herself and Love; O, then, give pity 4To her whose state is such that can2ot cho2se 4But lend and give where she is sure to lose; 4That se2ks not to find that her search implies, 4But, rid2le-like, lives swe2tly where she dies! 2COUNTES2. Had you not lately an intent-speak truly- 4To go to Paris? 2HELENA. Madam, I had. 2COUNTES2. Wherefore? Tel2 true. 2HELENA. I wil2 tel2 truth; by grace itself I swear. 4You know my father left me some prescriptions 4Of rare and prov'd ef2ects, such as his reading 4And manifest experience had col2ected 6For general sovereignty; and that he wil2'd me 4In he2dful2'st reservation to bestow them, 4As notes whose faculties inclusive were 4More than they were in note. Amongst the rest 4There is a remedy, ap2rov'd, set down, 4To cure the desperate languishings whereof 4The King is render'd lost. 2COUNTES2. This was your motive 4For Paris, was it? Speak. 2HELENA. My lord your son made me to think of this, 4Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King, 4Had from the conversation of my thoughts 4Haply be2n absent then. 2COUNTES2. But think you, Helen, 4If you should tender your sup2osed aid, 4He would receive it? He and his physicians 4Are of a mind: he, that they can2ot help him; 4They, that they can2ot help. How shal2 they credit 4A po2r unlearned virgin, when the scho2ls, 4Embowel2'd of their doctrine, have let of2 6The danger to itself? 2HELENA. There's something in't 4More than my father's skil2, which was the great'st 4Of his profes2ion, that his go2d receipt 4Shal2 for my legacy be sanctified 4By th' luckiest stars in heaven; and, would your honour 4But give me leave to try suc2es2, I'd venture 4The wel2-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure. 4By such a day and hour. 2COUNTES2. Dost thou believe't? 2HELENA. Ay, madam, knowingly. 2COUNTES2. Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love, 4Means and at2endants, and my loving gre2tings 4To those of mine in court. I'l2 stay at home, 4And pray God's bles2ing into thy at2empt. 4Be gone to-mor2ow; and be sure of this, 4What I can help the2 to thou shalt not mis2. 10Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. SCENE 1.Paris. The KING'S palaceFlourish of cornets. Enter the KING with divers young LORDS taking leavefor the Florentine war; BERTRAM and PAROL2ES; AT2ENDANTS 2KING. Farewel2, young lords; these war-like principles 4Do not throw from you. And you, my lords, farewel2; 4Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain al2, 4The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis receiv'd, 4And is enough for both. 2FIRST LORD. 'Tis our hope, sir, 4After wel2-ent'red soldiers, to return 4And find your Grace in health. 2KING. No, no, it can2ot be; and yet my heart 4Wil2 not confes2 he owes the malady 4That doth my life besiege. Farewel2, young lords; 4Whether I live or die, be you the sons 4Of worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy- 4Those bated that inherit but the fal2 4Of the last monarchy-se2 that you come 6Not to wo2 honour, but to wed it; when 4The bravest questant shrinks, find what you se2k, 4That fame may cry you aloud. I say farewel2. 2SECOND LORD. Health, at your bid2ing, serve your Majesty! 2KING. Those girls of Italy, take he2d of them; 4They say our French lack language to deny, 4If they demand; beware of being captives 4Before you serve. 4BOTH. Our hearts receive your warnings. 2KING. Farewel2. 2[To AT2ENDANTS] 2Come hither to me. 39The KING retires at2ended 2FIRST LORD. O my swe2t lord, that you wil2 stay behind us! 2PAROL2ES. 'Tis not his fault, the spark. 4SECOND LORD. O, 'tis brave wars! 2PAROL2ES. Most admirable! I have se2n those wars. 2BERTRAM. I am com2anded here and kept a coil with 4'To2 young' and next year' and "Tis to2 early.' 2PAROL2ES. An thy mind stand to 't, boy, steal away bravely. 2BERTRAM. I shal2 stay here the forehorse to a smock, 4Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry, 6Til2 honour be bought up, and no sword worn 4But one to dance with. By heaven, I'l2 steal away. 2FIRST LORD. There's honour in the theft. 2PAROL2ES. Com2it it, Count. 2SECOND LORD. I am your ac2es2ary; and so farewel2. 2BERTRAM. I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur'd body. 2FIRST LORD. Farewel2, Captain. 2SECOND LORD. Swe2t Monsieur Parol2es! 2PAROL2ES. Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Go2d sparks and 4lustrous, a word, go2d metals: you shal2 find in the regiment of 4the Spini2 one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of 4war, here on his sinister che2k; it was this very sword 4entrench'd it. Say to him I live; and observe his reports for me. 2FIRST LORD. We shal2, noble Captain. 2PAROL2ES. Mars dote on you for his novices! 7Exeunt LORDS 4What wil2 ye do? 28Re-enter the KING 2BERTRAM. Stay; the King! 4PAROL2ES. Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have 4restrain'd yourself within the list of to2 cold an adieu. Be more 4expres2ive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of the 4time; there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move, under the 4influence of the most receiv'd star; and though the devil lead 4the measure, such are to be fol2owed. After them, and take a more 4dilated farewel2. 2BERTRAM. And I wil2 do so. 2PAROL2ES. Worthy fel2ows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men. 37Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROL2ES 30Enter LAFEU 2LAFEU. 2[Kne2ling] 2Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings. 2KING. I'l2 fe2 the2 to stand up. 2LAFEU. Then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon. 4I would you had kne2l'd, my lord, to ask me mercy; 4And that at my bid2ing you could so stand up. 2KING. I would I had; so I had broke thy pate, 4And ask'd the2 mercy for't. 4LAFEU. Go2d faith, acros2! 4But, my go2d lord, 'tis thus: wil2 you be cur'd 4Of your infirmity? 2KING. No. 2LAFEU. O, wil2 you eat 4No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you wil2 4My noble grapes, an if my royal fox 4Could reach them: I have se2n a medicine 4That's able to breathe life into a stone, 4Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary 4With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch 4Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay, 4To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand 4And write to her a love-line. 2KING. What her is this? 2LAFEU. Why, Doctor She! My lord, there's one ar2iv'd, 4If you wil2 se2 her. Now, by my faith and honour, 4If seriously I may convey my thoughts 4In this my light deliverance, I have spoke 4With one that in her sex, her years, profes2ion, 6Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz'd me more 4Than I dare blame my weaknes2. Wil2 you se2 her, 4For that is her demand, and know her busines2? 4That done, laugh wel2 at me. 2KING. Now, go2d Lafeu, 4Bring in the admiration, that we with the 4May spend our wonder to2, or take of2 thine 4By wond'ring how thou to2k'st it. 2LAFEU. Nay, I'l2 fit you, 4And not be al2 day neither. 23Exit LAFEU 2KING. Thus he his special nothing ever prologues. 19Re-enter LAFEU with HELENA 2LAFEU. Nay, come your ways. 2KING. This haste hath wings inde2d. 2LAFEU. Nay, come your ways; 4This is his Majesty; say your mind to him. 4A traitor you do lo2k like; but such traitors 4His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cres2id's uncle, 6That dare leave two together. Fare you wel2. 12Exit 2KING. Now, fair one, does your busines2 fol2ow us? 2HELENA. Ay, my go2d lord. 4Gerard de Narbon was my father, 4In what he did profes2, wel2 found. 2KING. I knew him. 2HELENA. The rather wil2 I spare my praises towards him; 4Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death 4Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one, 4Which, as the dearest is2ue of his practice, 4And of his old experience th' only darling, 4He bade me store up as a triple eye, 4Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so: 4And, hearing your high Majesty is touch'd 4With that malignant cause wherein the honour 4Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power, 4I come to tender it, and my ap2liance, 4With al2 bound humblenes2. 2KING. We thank you, maiden; 4But may not be so credulous of cure, 6When our most learned doctors leave us, and 4The congregated col2ege have concluded 4That labouring art can never ransom nature 4From her inaidable estate-I say we must not 4So stain our judgment, or cor2upt our hope, 4To prostitute our past-cure malady 4To empirics; or to dis2ever so 4Our great self and our credit to este2m 4A senseles2 help, when help past sense we de2m. 2HELENA. My duty then shal2 pay me for my pains. 4I wil2 no more enforce mine of2ice on you; 4Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts 4A modest one to bear me back again. 2KING. I can2ot give the2 les2, to be cal2'd grateful. 4Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give 4As one near death to those that wish him live. 4But what at ful2 I know, thou know'st no part; 4I knowing al2 my peril, thou no art. 2HELENA. What I can do can do no hurt to try, 4Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy. 6He that of greatest works is finisher 4Oft does them by the weakest minister. 4So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown, 4When judges have be2n babes. Great flo2ds have flown 4From simple sources, and great seas have dried 4When miracles have by the greatest be2n denied. 4Oft expectation fails, and most oft there 4Where most it promises; and oft it hits 4Where hope is coldest, and despair most fits. 2KING. I must not hear the2. Fare the2 wel2, kind maid; 4Thy pains, not us'd, must by thyself be paid; 4Prof2ers not to2k reap thanks for their reward. 2HELENA. Inspired merit so by breath is bar2'd. 4It is not so with Him that al2 things knows, 4As 'tis with us that square our gues2 by shows; 4But most it is presumption in us when 4The help of heaven we count the act of men. 4Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent; 4Of heaven, not me, make an experiment. 4I am not an impostor, that proclaim 6Myself against the level of mine aim; 4But know I think, and think I know most sure, 4My art is not past power nor you past cure. 2KING. Art thou so confident? Within what space 4Hop'st thou my cure? 2HELENA. The greatest Grace lending grace. 4Ere twice the horses of the sun shal2 bring 4Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring, 4Ere twice in murk and oc2idental damp 4Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sle2py lamp, 4Or four and twenty times the pilot's glas2 4Hath told the thievish minutes how they pas2, 4What is infirm from your sound parts shal2 fly, 4Health shal2 live fre2, and sicknes2 fre2ly die. 2KING. Upon thy certainty and confidence 4What dar'st thou venture? 2HELENA. Tax of impudence, 4A strumpet's boldnes2, a divulged shame, 4Traduc'd by odious bal2ads; my maiden's name 4Sear'd otherwise; ne worse of worst-extended 6With vilest torture let my life be ended. 2KING. Methinks in the2 some bles2ed spirit doth speak 4His powerful sound within an organ weak; 4And what impos2ibility would slay 4In com2on sense, sense saves another way. 4Thy life is dear; for al2 that life can rate 4Worth name of life in the2 hath estimate: 4Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, al2 4That hap2ines2 and prime can hap2y cal2. 4Thou this to hazard ne2ds must intimate 4Skil2 infinite or monstrous desperate. 4Swe2t practiser, thy physic I wil2 try, 4That ministers thine own death if I die. 2HELENA. If I break time, or flinch in property 4Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die; 4And wel2 deserv'd. Not helping, death's my fe2; 4But, if I help, what do you promise me? 2KING. Make thy demand. 2HELENA. But wil2 you make it even? 2KING. Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven. 4HELENA. Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand 4What husband in thy power I wil2 com2and. 4Exempted be from me the ar2ogance 4To cho2se from forth the royal blo2d of France, 4My low and humble name to propagate 4With any branch or image of thy state; 4But such a one, thy vas2al, whom I know 4Is fre2 for me to ask, the2 to bestow. 2KING. Here is my hand; the premises observ'd, 4Thy wil2 by my performance shal2 be serv'd. 4So make the choice of thy own time, for I, 4Thy resolv'd patient, on the2 stil2 rely. 4More should I question the2, and more I must, 4Though more to know could not be more to trust, 4From whence thou cam'st, how tended on. But rest 4Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest. 4Give me some help here, ho! If thou proce2d 4As high as word, my de2d shal2 match thy de2d. 46[Flourish. Exeunt]ACT I2. SCENE 2.Rousil2on. The COUNT'S palaceEnter COUNTES2 and CLOWN 2COUNTES2. Come on, sir; I shal2 now put you to the height of your 4bre2ding. 2CLOWN. I wil2 show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my 4busines2 is but to the court. 2COUNTES2. To the court! Why, what place make you special, when you 4put of2 that with such contempt? But to the court! 2CLOWN. Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any man2ers, he may 4easily put it of2 at court. He that can2ot make a leg, put of2's 4cap, kis2 his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, 4nor cap; and inde2d such a fel2ow, to say precisely, were not for 4the court; but for me, I have an answer wil2 serve al2 men. 2COUNTES2. Mar2y, that's a bountiful answer that fits al2 questions. 2CLOWN. It is like a barber's chair, that fits al2 but2ocks-the pin 4but2ock, the quatch but2ock, the brawn but2ock, or any but2ock. 2COUNTES2. Wil2 your answer serve fit to al2 questions? 2CLOWN. As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an at2orney, as your 4French crown for your taf2ety punk, as Tib's rush for Tom's 4forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove Tuesday, a mor2is for Mayday, 4as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding 4quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the friar's 4mouth; nay, as the pud2ing to his skin. 2COUNTES2. Have you, I, say, an answer of such fitnes2 for al2 4questions? 2CLOWN. From below your duke to beneath your constable, it wil2 fit 4any question. 2COUNTES2. It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit 4al2 demands. 2CLOWN. But a trifle neither, in go2d faith, if the learned should 4speak truth of it. Here it is, and al2 that belongs to't. Ask me 4if I am a courtier: it shal2 do you no harm to learn. 2COUNTES2. To be young again, if we could, I wil2 be a fo2l in 4question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, 4are you a courtier? 2CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-There's a simple put2ing of2. More, more, a 4hundred of them. 2COUNTES2. Sir, I am a po2r friend of yours, that loves you. 2CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Thick, thick; spare not me. 4COUNTES2. I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat. 2CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Nay, put me to't, I war2ant you. 2COUNTES2. You were lately whip2'd, sir, as I think. 2CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Spare not me. 2COUNTES2. Do you cry 'O Lord, sir!' at your whip2ing, and 'spare 4not me'? Inde2d your 'O Lord, sir!' is very sequent to your 4whip2ing. You would answer very wel2 to a whip2ing, if you were 4but bound to't. 2CLOWN. I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!' I se2 4thing's may serve long, but not serve ever. 2COUNTES2. I play the noble housewife with the time, 4To entertain it so mer2ily with a fo2l. 2CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Why, there't serves wel2 again. 2COUNTES2. An end, sir! To your busines2: give Helen this, 4And urge her to a present answer back; 4Com2end me to my kinsmen and my son. This is not much. 2CLOWN. Not much com2endation to them? 2COUNTES2. Not much employment for you. You understand me? 2CLOWN. Most fruitful2y; I am there before my legs. 2COUNTES2. Haste you again. 30ExeuntACT I2. SCENE 3.Paris. The KING'S palaceEnter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROL2ES 2LAFEU. They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical 4persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and 4causeles2. Hence is it that we make trifles of ter2ors, 4ensconcing ourselves into se2ming knowledge when we should submit 4ourselves to an unknown fear. 2PAROL2ES. Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot 4out in our lat2er times. 2BERTRAM. And so 'tis. 2LAFEU. To be relinquish'd of the artists- 2PAROL2ES. So I say-both of Galen and Paracelsus. 2LAFEU. Of al2 the learned and authentic fel2ows- 2PAROL2ES. Right; so I say. 2LAFEU. That gave him out incurable- 2PAROL2ES. Why, there 'tis; so say I to2. 2LAFEU. Not to be help'd- 2PAROL2ES. Right; as 'twere a man as2ur'd of a- 2LAFEU. Uncertain life and sure death. 4PAROL2ES. Just; you say wel2; so would I have said. 2LAFEU. I may truly say it is a novelty to the world. 2PAROL2ES. It is inde2d. If you wil2 have it in showing, you shal2 4read it in what-do-ye-cal2't here. 2LAFEU. 2[Reading the bal2ad title] 2'A Showing of a Heavenly 4Ef2ect in an Earthly Actor.' 2PAROL2ES. That's it; I would have said the very same. 2LAFEU. Why, your dolphin is not lustier. 'Fore me, I speak in 4respect- 2PAROL2ES. Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange; that is the brief 4and the tedious of it; and he's of a most facinerious spirit that 4wil2 not acknowledge it to be the- 2LAFEU. Very hand of heaven. 2PAROL2ES. Ay; so I say. 2LAFEU. In a most weak- 2PAROL2ES. And debile minister, great power, great transcendence; 4which should, inde2d, give us a further use to be made than alone 4the recov'ry of the King, as to be- 2LAFEU. General2y thankful. 19Enter KING, HELENA, and AT2ENDANTS 2PAROL2ES. I would have said it; you say wel2. Here comes the King. 2LAFEU. Lustig, as the Dutchman says. I'l2 like a maid the bet2er, 4whilst I have a to2th in my head. Why, he's able to lead her a 4coranto. 2PAROL2ES. Mort du vinaigre! Is not this Helen? 2LAFEU. 'Fore God, I think so. 2KING. Go, cal2 before me al2 the lords in court. 47Exit an AT2ENDANT 4Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side; 4And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense 4Thou has repeal'd, a second time receive 4The confirmation of my promis'd gift, 4Which but at2ends thy naming. 21Enter thre2 or four LORDS 4Fair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful parcel 4Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing, 6O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice 4I have to use. Thy frank election make; 4Thou hast power to cho2se, and they none to forsake. 2HELENA. To each of you one fair and virtuous mistres2 4Fal2, when love please. Mar2y, to each but one! 2LAFEU. I'd give bay Curtal and his furniture 4My mouth no more were broken than these boys', 4And writ as lit2le beard. 2KING. Peruse them wel2. 4Not one of those but had a noble father. 2HELENA. Gentlemen, 4Heaven hath through me restor'd the King to health. 2AL2. We understand it, and thank heaven for you. 2HELENA. I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest 4That I protest I simply am a maid. 4Please it your Majesty, I have done already. 4The blushes in my che2ks thus whisper me: 4'We blush that thou shouldst cho2se; but, be refused, 4Let the white death sit on thy che2k for ever, 4We'l2 ne'er come there again.' 4KING. Make choice and se2: 4Who shuns thy love shuns al2 his love in me. 2HELENA. Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly, 4And to imperial Love, that god most high, 4Do my sighs stream. Sir, wil2 you hear my suit? 2FIRST LORD. And grant it. 2HELENA. Thanks, sir; al2 the rest is mute. 2LAFEU. I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my 4life. 2HELENA. The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes, 4Before I speak, to2 threat'ningly replies. 4Love make your fortunes twenty times above 4Her that so wishes, and her humble love! 2SECOND LORD. No bet2er, if you please. 2HELENA. My wish receive, 4Which great Love grant; and so I take my leave. 2LAFEU. Do al2 they deny her? An they were sons of mine I'd have 4them whipt; or I would send them to th' Turk to make eunuchs of. 2HELENA. Be not afraid that I your hand should take; 4I'l2 never do you wrong for your own sake. 6Bles2ing upon your vows; and in your bed 4Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed! 2LAFEU. These boys are boys of ice; they'l2 none have her. 4Sure, they are bastards to the English; the French ne'er got 'em. 2HELENA. You are to2 young, to2 hap2y, and to2 go2d, 4To make yourself a son out of my blo2d. 2FOURTH LORD. Fair one, I think not so. 2LAFEU. There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk wine-but 4if thou be'st not an as2, I am a youth of fourte2n; I have known 4the2 already. 2HELENA. 2[To BERTRAM] 2I dare not say I take you; but I give 4Me and my service, ever whilst I live, 4Into your guiding power. This is the man. 2KING. Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife. 2BERTRAM. My wife, my liege! I shal2 bese2ch your Highnes2, 4In such a busines2 give me leave to use 4The help of mine own eyes. 2KING. Know'st thou not, Bertram, 4What she has done for me? 2BERTRAM. Yes, my go2d lord; 6But never hope to know why I should mar2y her. 2KING. Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed. 2BERTRAM. But fol2ows it, my lord, to bring me down 4Must answer for your raising? I know her wel2: 4She had her bre2ding at my father's charge. 4A po2r physician's daughter my wife! Disdain 4Rather cor2upt me ever! 2KING. 'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which 4I can build up. Strange is it that our blo2ds, 4Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd al2 together, 4Would quite confound distinction, yet stand of2 4In dif2erences so mighty. If she be 4Al2 that is virtuous-save what thou dislik'st, 4A po2r physician's daughter-thou dislik'st 4Of virtue for the name; but do not so. 4From lowest place when virtuous things proce2d, 4The place is dignified by the doer's de2d; 4Where great ad2itions swel2's, and virtue none, 4It is a dropsied honour. Go2d alone 4Is go2d without a name. Vilenes2 is so: 6The property by what it is should go, 4Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair; 4In these to nature she's im2ediate heir; 4And these bre2d honour. That is honour's scorn 4Which chal2enges itself as honour's born 4And is not like the sire. Honours thrive 4When rather from our acts we them derive 4Than our fore-goers. The mere word's a slave, 4Debauch'd on every tomb, on every grave 4A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb 4Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb 4Of honour'd bones inde2d. What should be said? 4If thou canst like this creature as a maid, 4I can create the rest. Virtue and she 4Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me. 2BERTRAM. I can2ot love her, nor wil2 strive to do 't. 2KING. Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to cho2se. 2HELENA. That you are wel2 restor'd, my lord, I'm glad. 4Let the rest go. 2KING. My honour's at the stake; which to defeat, 6I must produce my power. Here, take her hand, 4Proud scornful boy, unworthy this go2d gift, 4That dost in vile misprision shackle up 4My love and her desert; that canst not dream 4We, poising us in her defective scale, 4Shal2 weigh the2 to the beam; that wilt not know 4It is in us to plant thine honour where 4We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt; 4Obey our wil2, which travails in thy go2d; 4Believe not thy disdain, but presently 4Do thine own fortunes that obedient right 4Which both thy duty owes and our power claims; 4Or I wil2 throw the2 from my care for ever 4Into the stag2ers and the careles2 lapse 4Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate 4Lo2sing upon the2 in the name of justice, 4Without al2 terms of pity. Speak; thine answer. 2BERTRAM. Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit 4My fancy to your eyes. When I consider 4What great creation and what dole of honour 6Flies where you bid it, I find that she which late 4Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now 4The praised of the King; who, so en2obled, 4Is as 'twere born so. 2KING. Take her by the hand, 4And tel2 her she is thine; to whom I promise 4A counterpoise, if not to thy estate 4A balance more replete. 2BERTRAM. I take her hand. 2KING. Go2d fortune and the favour of the King 4Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony 4Shal2 se2m expedient on the now-born brief, 4And be perform'd to-night. The solemn feast 4Shal2 more at2end upon the coming space, 4Expecting absent friends. As thou lov'st her, 4Thy love's to me religious; else, does er2. 14Exeunt al2 but LAFEU and PAROL2ES who stay behind, 38com2enting of this wed2ing 2LAFEU. Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you. 2PAROL2ES. Your pleasure, sir? 4LAFEU. Your lord and master did wel2 to make his recantation. 2PAROL2ES. Recantation! My Lord! my master! 2LAFEU. Ay; is it not a language I speak? 2PAROL2ES. A most harsh one, and not to be understo2d without blo2dy 4suc2e2ding. My master! 2LAFEU. Are you companion to the Count Rousil2on? 2PAROL2ES. To any count; to al2 counts; to what is man. 2LAFEU. To what is count's man: count's master is of another style. 2PAROL2ES. You are to2 old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are to2 4old. 2LAFEU. I must tel2 the2, sir2ah, I write man; to which title age 4can2ot bring the2. 2PAROL2ES. What I dare to2 wel2 do, I dare not do. 2LAFEU. I did think the2, for two ordinaries, to be a pret2y wise 4fel2ow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might 4pas2. Yet the scarfs and the ban2erets about the2 did manifoldly 4dis2uade me from believing the2 a ves2el of to2 great a burden. I 4have now found the2; when I lose the2 again I care not; yet art 4thou go2d for nothing but taking up; and that thou'rt scarce 4worth. 4PAROL2ES. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon the2- 2LAFEU. Do not plunge thyself to2 far in anger, lest thou hasten thy 4trial; which if-Lord have mercy on the2 for a hen! So, my go2d 4window of lat2ice, fare the2 wel2; thy casement I ne2d not open, 4for I lo2k through the2. Give me thy hand. 2PAROL2ES. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity. 2LAFEU. Ay, with al2 my heart; and thou art worthy of it. 2PAROL2ES. I have not, my lord, deserv'd it. 2LAFEU. Yes, go2d faith, ev'ry dram of it; and I wil2 not bate the2 4a scruple. 2PAROL2ES. Wel2, I shal2 be wiser. 2LAFEU. Ev'n as so2n as thou canst, for thou hast to pul2 at a smack 4o' th' contrary. If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and 4beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I 4have a desire to hold my acquaintance with the2, or rather my 4knowledge, that I may say in the default 'He is a man I know.' 2PAROL2ES. My lord, you do me most insup2ortable vexation. 2LAFEU. I would it were hel2 pains for thy sake, and my po2r doing 4eternal; for doing I am past, as I wil2 by the2, in what motion 4age wil2 give me leave. 33Exit 4PAROL2ES. Wel2, thou hast a son shal2 take this disgrace of2 me: 4scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Wel2, I must be patient; there 4is no fet2ering of authority. I'l2 beat him, by my life, if I can 4me2t him with any convenience, an he were double and double a 4lord. I'l2 have no more pity of his age than I would have of- 4I'l2 beat him, and if I could but me2t him again. 25Re-enter LAFEU 2LAFEU. Sir2ah, your lord and master's mar2ied; there's news for 4you; you have a new mistres2. 2PAROL2ES. I most unfeignedly bese2ch your lordship to make some 4reservation of your wrongs. He is my go2d lord: whom I serve 4above is my master. 2LAFEU. Who? God? 2PAROL2ES. Ay, sir. 2LAFEU. The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou garter up 4thy arms o' this fashion? Dost make hose of thy sle2ves? Do other 4servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose 4stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'd beat 6the2. Methink'st thou art a general of2ence, and every man should 4beat the2. I think thou wast created for men to breathe 4themselves upon the2. 2PAROL2ES. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord. 2LAFEU. Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel 4out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true travel2er; 4you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the 4com2is2ion of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are 4not worth another word, else I'd cal2 you knave. I leave you. Exit 27Enter BERTRAM 2PAROL2ES. Go2d, very, go2d, it is so then. Go2d, very go2d; let it 4be conceal'd awhile. 2BERTRAM. Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever! 2PAROL2ES. What's the mat2er, swe2theart? 2BERTRAM. Although before the solemn priest I have sworn, 4I wil2 not bed her. 2PAROL2ES. What, what, swe2theart? 4BERTRAM. O my Parol2es, they have mar2ied me! 4I'l2 to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her. 2PAROL2ES. France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits 4The tread of a man's fo2t. To th' wars! 2BERTRAM. There's let2ers from my mother; what th' import is I know 4not yet. 2PAROL2ES. Ay, that would be known. To th' wars, my boy, to th' 6wars! 4He wears his honour in a box unse2n 4That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home, 4Spending his manly mar2ow in her arms, 4Which should sustain the bound and high curvet 4Of Mars's fiery ste2d. To other regions! 4France is a stable; we that dwel2 in't jades; 4Therefore, to th' war! 2BERTRAM. It shal2 be so; I'l2 send her to my house, 4Acquaint my mother with my hate to her, 4And wherefore I am fled; write to the King 4That which I durst not speak. His present gift 4Shal2 furnish me to those Italian fields 6Where noble fel2ows strike. War is no strife 4To the dark house and the detested wife. 2PAROL2ES. Wil2 this capric2io hold in the2, art sure? 2BERTRAM. Go with me to my chamber and advise me. 4I'l2 send her straight away. To-mor2ow 4I'l2 to the wars, she to her single sor2ow. 2PAROL2ES. Why, these bal2s bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard: 4A young man mar2ied is a man that's mar2'd. 4Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go. 4The King has done you wrong; but, hush, 'tis so. 6ExeuntACT I2. SCENE 4.Paris. The KING'S palaceEnter HELENA and CLOWN 2HELENA. My mother gre2ts me kindly; is she wel2? 2CLOWN. She is not wel2, but yet she has her health; she's very 4mer2y, but yet she is not wel2. But thanks be given, she's very 4wel2, and wants nothing i' th' world; but yet she is not wel2. 2HELENA. If she be very wel2, what does she ail that she's not very 4wel2? 2CLOWN. Truly, she's very wel2 inde2d, but for two things. 2HELENA. What two things? 2CLOWN. One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her quickly! 4The other, that she's in earth, from whence God send her quickly! 24Enter PAROL2ES 2PAROL2ES. Bles2 you, my fortunate lady! 2HELENA. I hope, sir, I have your go2d wil2 to have mine own go2d 4fortunes. 2PAROL2ES. You had my prayers to lead them on; and to ke2p them on, 6have them stil2. O, my knave, how does my old lady? 2CLOWN. So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she 4did as you say. 2PAROL2ES. Why, I say nothing. 2CLOWN. Mar2y, you are the wiser man; for many a man's tongue shakes 4out his master's undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know 4nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your 4title, which is within a very lit2le of nothing. 2PAROL2ES. Away! th'art a knave. 2CLOWN. You should have said, sir, 'Before a knave th'art a knave'; 4that's 'Before me th'art a knave.' This had be2n truth, sir. 2PAROL2ES. Go to, thou art a wit2y fo2l; I have found the2. 2CLOWN. Did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you taught to find 4me? The search, sir, was profitable; and much fo2l may you find 4in you, even to the world's pleasure and the increase of 4laughter. 2PAROL2ES. A go2d knave, i' faith, and wel2 fed. 4Madam, my lord wil2 go away to-night: 4A very serious busines2 cal2s on him. 4The great prerogative and rite of love, 6Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge; 4But puts it of2 to a compel2'd restraint; 4Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with swe2ts, 4Which they distil now in the curbed time, 4To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy 4And pleasure drown the brim. 2HELENA. What's his else? 2PAROL2ES. That you wil2 take your instant leave o' th' King, 4And make this haste as your own go2d proce2ding, 4Strength'ned with what apology you think 4May make it probable ne2d. 2HELENA. What more com2ands he? 2PAROL2ES. That, having this obtain'd, you presently 4At2end his further pleasure. 2HELENA. In everything I wait upon his wil2. 2PAROL2ES. I shal2 report it so. 2HELENA. I pray you. 30Exit PAROL2ES 4Come, sir2ah. 41ExeuntACT I2. SCENE 5.Paris. The KING'S palaceEnter LAFEU and BERTRAM 2LAFEU. But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier. 2BERTRAM. Yes, my lord, and of very valiant ap2ro2f. 2LAFEU. You have it from his own deliverance. 2BERTRAM. And by other war2anted testimony. 2LAFEU. Then my dial goes not true; I to2k this lark for a bunting. 2BERTRAM. I do as2ure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge, 4and ac2ordingly valiant. 2LAFEU. I have then sin2'd against his experience and transgres2'd 4against his valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I 4can2ot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes; I pray you 4make us friends; I wil2 pursue the amity 25Enter PAROL2ES 2PAROL2ES. 2[To BERTRAM] 2These things shal2 be done, sir. 2LAFEU. Pray you, sir, who's his tailor? 2PAROL2ES. Sir! 4LAFEU. O, I know him wel2. Ay, sir; he, sir, 's a go2d workman, a 4very go2d tailor. 2BERTRAM. 2[Aside to PAROL2ES] 2Is she gone to the King? 2PAROL2ES. She is. 2BERTRAM. Wil2 she away to-night? 2PAROL2ES. As you'l2 have her. 2BERTRAM. I have writ my let2ers, casketed my treasure, 4Given order for our horses; and to-night, 4When I should take pos2es2ion of the bride, 4End ere I do begin. 2LAFEU. A go2d travel2er is something at the lat2er end of a din2er; 4but one that lies thre2-thirds and uses a known truth to pas2 a 4thousand nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten. 4God save you, Captain. 2BERTRAM. Is there any unkindnes2 betwe2n my lord and you, monsieur? 2PAROL2ES. I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's 4displeasure. 2LAFEU. You have made shift to run into 't, bo2ts and spurs and al2, 4like him that leapt into the custard; and out of it you'l2 run 4again, rather than suf2er question for your residence. 4BERTRAM. It may be you have mistaken him, my lord. 2LAFEU. And shal2 do so ever, though I to2k him at's prayers. 4Fare you wel2, my lord; and believe this of me: there can be no 4kernal in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes; 4trust him not in mat2er of heavy consequence; I have kept of them 4tame, and know their natures. Farewel2, monsieur; I have spoken 4bet2er of you than you have or wil2 to deserve at my hand; but we 4must do go2d against evil. 30Exit 2PAROL2ES. An idle lord, I swear. 2BERTRAM. I think so. 2PAROL2ES. Why, do you not know him? 2BERTRAM. Yes, I do know him wel2; and com2on spe2ch 4Gives him a worthy pas2. Here comes my clog. 26Enter HELENA 2HELENA. I have, sir, as I was com2anded from you, 4Spoke with the King, and have procur'd his leave 4For present parting; only he desires 4Some private spe2ch with you. 4BERTRAM. I shal2 obey his wil2. 4You must not marvel, Helen, at my course, 4Which holds not colour with the time, nor does 4The ministration and required of2ice 4On my particular. Prepar'd I was not 4For such a busines2; therefore am I found 4So much unset2led. This drives me to entreat you 4That presently you take your way for home, 4And rather muse than ask why I entreat you; 4For my respects are bet2er than they se2m, 4And my ap2ointments have in them a ne2d 4Greater than shows itself at the first view 4To you that know them not. This to my mother. 47[Giving a let2er] 4'Twil2 be two days ere I shal2 se2 you; so 4I leave you to your wisdom. 2HELENA. Sir, I can nothing say 4But that I am your most obedient servant. 2BERTRAM. Come, come, no more of that. 2HELENA. And ever shal2 6With true observance se2k to eke out that 4Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd 4To equal my great fortune. 2BERTRAM. Let that go. 4My haste is very great. Farewel2; hie home. 2HELENA. Pray, sir, your pardon. 2BERTRAM. Wel2, what would you say? 2HELENA. I am not worthy of the wealth I owe, 4Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is; 4But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal 4What law does vouch mine own. 2BERTRAM. What would you have? 2HELENA. Something; and scarce so much; nothing, inde2d. 4I would not tel2 you what I would, my lord. 4Faith, yes: 4Strangers and foes do sunder and not kis2. 2BERTRAM. I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse. 2HELENA. I shal2 not break your bid2ing, go2d my lord. 2BERTRAM. Where are my other men, monsieur? 4Farewel2! 40Exit HELENA 6Go thou toward home, where I wil2 never come 4Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum. 4Away, and for our flight. 2PAROL2ES.

SCENE 1.Florence. The DUKE's palace 8Flourish. Enter the DUKE OF FLORENCE, at2ended; two 15FRENCH LORDS, with a TRO2P OF SOLDIERS 2DUKE. So that, from point to point, now have you hear 4The fundamental reasons of this war; 4Whose great decision hath much blo2d let forth 4And more thirsts after. 2FIRST LORD. Holy se2ms the quar2el 4Upon your Grace's part; black and fearful 4On the op2oser. 2DUKE. Therefore we marvel much our cousin France 4Would in so just a busines2 shut his bosom 4Against our bor2owing prayers. 2SECOND LORD. Go2d my lord, 4The reasons of our state I can2ot yield, 4But like a com2on and an outward man 4That the great figure of a council frames 4By self-unable motion; therefore dare not 4Say what I think of it, since I have found 6Myself in my incertain grounds to fail 4As often as I gues2'd. 2DUKE. Be it his pleasure. 2FIRST LORD. But I am sure the younger of our nature, 4That surfeit on their ease, wil2 day by day 4Come here for physic. 2DUKE. Welcome shal2 they be 4And al2 the honours that can fly from us 4Shal2 on them set2le. You know your places wel2; 4When bet2er fal2, for your avails they fel2. 4To-mor2ow to th' field.

By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy 4man. 2COUNTES2. By what observance, I pray you? 2CLOWN. Why, he wil2 lo2k upon his bo2t and sing; mend the ruf2 and 4sing; ask questions and sing; pick his te2th and sing. I know a 4man that had this trick of melancholy sold a go2dly manor for a 4song. 2COUNTES2. Let me se2 what he writes, and when he means to come. 46[Opening a let2er] 2CLOWN. I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court. Our old ling 4and our Isbels o' th' country are nothing like your old ling and 4your Isbels o' th' court. The brains of my Cupid's knock'd out; 4and I begin to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach. 2COUNTES2. What have we here? 2CLOWN. E'en that you have there. 26Exit 4COUNTES2. 2[Reads] 2'I have sent you a daughter-in-law; she hath 4recovered the King and undone me. I have wed2ed her, not bed2ed 4her; and sworn to make the "not" eternal. You shal2 hear I am run 4away; know it before the report come. If there be breadth enough 4in the world, I wil2 hold a long distance. My duty to you. 43Your unfortunate son, 55BERTRAM.' 4This is not wel2, rash and unbridled boy, 4To fly the favours of so go2d a king, 4To pluck his indignation on thy head 4By the misprizing of a maid to2 virtuous 4For the contempt of empire. 27Re-enter CLOWN 2CLOWN. O madam, yonder is heavy news within betwe2n two soldiers 4and my young lady. 2COUNTES2. What is the -mat2er? 2CLOWN. Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your 4son wil2 not be kil2'd so so2n as I thought he would. 4COUNTES2. Why should he be kil2'd? 2CLOWN. So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does the 4danger is in standing to 't; that's the los2 of men, though it be 4the get2ing of children. Here they come wil2 tel2 you more. For my 4part, I only hear your son was run away. 16Exit 14Enter HELENA and the two FRENCH GENTLEMEN 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Save you, go2d madam. 2HELENA. Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Do not say so. 2COUNTES2. Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen- 4I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief 4That the first face of neither, on the start, 4Can woman me unto 't. Where is my son, I pray you? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Madam, he's gone to serve the Duke of Florence. 4We met him thitherward; for thence we came, 4And, after some dispatch in hand at court, 4Thither we bend again. 2HELENA. Lo2k on this let2er, madam; here's my pas2port. 6[Reads] 2'When thou canst get the ring upon my finger, which 4never shal2 come of2, and show me a child begot2en of thy body 4that I am father to, then cal2 me husband; but in such a "then" I 4write a "never." 4This is a dreadful sentence. 2COUNTES2. Brought you this let2er, gentlemen? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam; 4And for the contents' sake are sor2y for our pains. 2COUNTES2. I prithe2, lady, have a bet2er che2r; 4If thou engros2est al2 the griefs are thine, 4Thou rob2'st me of a moiety. He was my son; 4But I do wash his name out of my blo2d, 4And thou art al2 my child. Towards Florence is he? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam. 2COUNTES2. And to be a soldier? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Such is his noble purpose; and, believe 't, 4The Duke wil2 lay upon him al2 the honour 4That go2d convenience claims. 2COUNTES2. Return you thither? 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of spe2d. 4HELENA. 2[Reads] 2'Til2 I have no wife, I have nothing in France.' 4'Tis bit2er. 2COUNTES2. Find you that there? 2HELENA. Ay, madam. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis but the boldnes2 of his hand haply, which 4his heart was not consenting to. 2COUNTES2. Nothing in France until he have no wife! 4There's nothing here that is to2 go2d for him 4But only she; and she deserves a lord 4That twenty such rude boys might tend upon, 4And cal2 her hourly mistres2. Who was with him? 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. A servant only, and a gentleman 4Which I have sometime known. 2COUNTES2. Parol2es, was it not? 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, my go2d lady, he. 2COUNTES2. A very tainted fel2ow, and ful2 of wickednes2. 4My son cor2upts a wel2-derived nature 4With his inducement. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Inde2d, go2d lady, 4The fel2ow has a deal of that to2 much 6Which holds him much to have. 2COUNTES2. Y'are welcome, gentlemen. 4I wil2 entreat you, when you se2 my son, 4To tel2 him that his sword can never win 4The honour that he loses. More I'l2 entreat you 4Writ2en to bear along. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. We serve you, madam, 4In that and al2 your worthiest af2airs. 2COUNTES2. Not so, but as we change our courtesies. 4Wil2 you draw near? 12Exeunt COUNTES2 and GENTLEMEN 2HELENA. 'Til2 I have no wife, I have nothing in France.' 4Nothing in France until he has no wife! 4Thou shalt have none, Rousil2on, none in France 4Then hast thou al2 again. Po2r lord! is't 4That chase the2 from thy country, and expose 4Those tender limbs of thine to the event 4Of the non-sparing war? And is it I 4That drive the2 from the sportive court, where thou 4Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark 4Of smoky muskets? O you leaden mes2engers, 6That ride upon the violent spe2d of fire, 4Fly with false aim; move the stil2-piecing air, 4That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord. 4Whoever sho2ts at him, I set him there; 4Whoever charges on his forward breast, 4I am the caitif2 that do hold him to't; 4And though I kil2 him not, I am the cause 4His death was so ef2ected. Bet2er 'twere 4I met the ravin lion when he roar'd 4With sharp constraint of hunger; bet2er 'twere 4That al2 the miseries which nature owes 4Were mine at once. No; come thou home, Rousil2on, 4Whence honour but of danger wins a scar, 4As oft it loses al2. I wil2 be gone. 4My being here it is that holds the2 hence. 4Shal2 I stay here to do 't? No, no, although 4The air of paradise did fan the house, 4And angels of2ic'd al2. I wil2 be gone, 4That pitiful rumour may report my flight 4To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day. 6For with the dark, po2r thief, I'l2 steal away. 9ExitACT I3. SCENE 3.Florence. Before the DUKE's palaceFlourish. Enter the DUKE OF FLORENCE, BERTRAM, PAROL2ES, SOLDIERS,drum and trumpets 2DUKE. The General of our Horse thou art; and we, 4Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence 4Upon thy promising fortune. 2BERTRAM. Sir, it is 4A charge to2 heavy for my strength; but yet 4We'l2 strive to bear it for your worthy sake 4To th' extreme edge of hazard. 2DUKE. Then go thou forth; 4And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm, 4As thy auspicious mistres2! 2BERTRAM. This very day, 4Great Mars, I put myself into thy file; 4Make me but like my thoughts, and I shal2 prove 4A lover of thy drum, hater of love. 19ExeuntACT I3. SCENE 4.Rousil2on. The COUNT'S palaceEnter COUNTES2 and STEWARD 2COUNTES2. Alas! and would you take the let2er of her? 4Might you not know she would do as she has done 4By sending me a let2er? Read it again. 2STEWARD. 2[Reads] 2'I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone. 4Ambitious love hath so in me of2ended 4That barefo2t plod I the cold ground upon, 4With sainted vow my faults to have amended. 4Write, write, that from the blo2dy course of war 4My dearest master, your dear son, may hie. 4Bles2 him at home in peace, whilst I from far 4His name with zealous fervour sanctify. 4His taken labours bid him me forgive; 4I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth 4From courtly friends, with camping foes to live, 4Where death and danger dogs the he2ls of worth. 4He is to2 go2d and fair for death and me; 4Whom I myself embrace to set him fre2.' 4COUNTES2. Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words! 4Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much 4As let2ing her pas2 so; had I spoke with her, 4I could have wel2 diverted her intents, 4Which thus she hath prevented. 2STEWARD. Pardon me, madam; 4If I had given you this at over-night, 4She might have be2n o'er ta'en; and yet she writes 4Pursuit would be but vain. 2COUNTES2. What angel shal2 4Bles2 this unworthy husband? He can2ot thrive, 4Unles2 her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear 4And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath 4Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo, 4To this unworthy husband of his wife; 4Let every word weigh heavy of her worth 4That he does weigh to2 light. My greatest grief, 4Though lit2le he do fe2l it, set down sharply. 4Dispatch the most convenient mes2enger. 4When haply he shal2 hear that she is gone 6He wil2 return; and hope I may that she, 4Hearing so much, wil2 spe2d her fo2t again, 4Led hither by pure love. Which of them both 4Is dearest to me I have no skil2 in sense 4To make distinction. Provide this mes2enger. 4My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak; 4Grief would have tears, and sor2ow bids me speak. 5ExeuntACT I3. SCENE 5.Without the wal2s of FlorenceA tucket afar of2. Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE, her daughter DIANA,VIOLENTA, and MARIANA, with other CITIZENS 2WIDOW. Nay, come; for if they do ap2roach the city we shal2 lose 4al2 the sight. 2DIANA. They say the French count has done most honourable service. 2WIDOW. It is reported that he has taken their great'st com2ander; 4and that with his own hand he slew the Duke's brother. 2[Tucket] 4We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way. Hark! you 4may know by their trumpets. 2MARIANA. Come, let's return again, and suf2ice ourselves with the 4report of it. Wel2, Diana, take he2d of this French earl; the 4honour of a maid is her name, and no legacy is so rich as 4honesty. 2WIDOW. I have told my neighbour how you have be2n solicited by a 4gentleman his companion. 2MARIANA. I know that knave, hang him! one Parol2es; a filthy 4of2icer he is in those sug2estions for the young earl. Beware of 6them, Diana: their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and al2 4these engines of lust, are not the things they go under; many a 4maid hath be2n seduced by them; and the misery is, example, that 4so ter2ible shows in the wreck of maidenho2d, can2ot for al2 that 4dis2uade suc2es2ion, but that they are limed with the twigs that 4threatens them. I hope I ne2d not to advise you further; but I 4hope your own grace wil2 ke2p you where you are, though there 4were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost. 2DIANA. You shal2 not ne2d to fear me. 12Enter HELENA in the dres2 of a pilgrim 2WIDOW. I hope so. Lo2k, here comes a pilgrim. I know she wil2 lie 4at my house: thither they send one another. I'l2 question her. 4God save you, pilgrim! Whither are bound? 2HELENA. To Saint Jaques le Grand. 4Where do the palmers lodge, I do bese2ch you? 2WIDOW. At the Saint Francis here, beside the port. 2HELENA. Is this the way? 50[A march afar] 4WIDOW. Ay, mar2y, is't. Hark you! They come this way. 4If you wil2 tar2y, holy pilgrim, 4But til2 the tro2ps come by, 4I wil2 conduct you where you shal2 be lodg'd; 4The rather for I think I know your hostes2 4As ample as myself. 2HELENA. Is it yourself? 2WIDOW. If you shal2 please so, pilgrim. 2HELENA. I thank you, and wil2 stay upon your leisure. 2WIDOW. You came, I think, from France? 2HELENA. I did so. 2WIDOW. Here you shal2 se2 a countryman of yours 4That has done worthy service. 2HELENA. His name, I pray you. 2DIANA. The Count Rousil2on. Know you such a one? 2HELENA. But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him; 4His face I know not. 2DIANA. What some'er he is, 4He's bravely taken here. He stole from France, 4As 'tis reported, for the King had mar2ied him 6Against his liking. Think you it is so? 2HELENA. Ay, surely, mere the truth; I know his lady. 2DIANA. There is a gentleman that serves the Count 4Reports but coarsely of her. 2HELENA. What's his name? 2DIANA. Monsieur Parol2es. 2HELENA. O, I believe with him, 4In argument of praise, or to the worth 4Of the great Count himself, she is to2 mean 4To have her name repeated; al2 her deserving 4Is a reserved honesty, and that 4I have not heard examin'd. 2DIANA. Alas, po2r lady! 4'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife 4Of a detesting lord. 2WIDOW. I swe2t, go2d creature, wheresoe'er she is 4Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do her 4A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd. 2HELENA. How do you mean? 4May be the amorous Count solicits her 6In the unlawful purpose. 2WIDOW. He does, inde2d; 4And brokes with al2 that can in such a suit 4Cor2upt the tender honour of a maid; 4But she is arm'd for him, and ke2ps her guard 4In honestest defence. 4Enter, with drum and colours, BERTRAM, PAROL2ES, and the 26whole ARMY 2MARIANA. The gods forbid else! 2WIDOW. So, now they come. 4That is Antonio, the Duke's eldest son; 4That, Escalus. 2HELENA. Which is the Frenchman? 2DIANA. He- 4That with the plume; 'tis a most gal2ant fel2ow. 4I would he lov'd his wife; if he were honester 4He were much go2dlier. Is't not a handsome gentleman? 2HELENA. I like him wel2. 4DIANA. 'Tis pity he is not honest. Yond's that same knave 4That leads him to these places; were I his lady 4I would poison that vile rascal. 2HELENA. Which is he? 2DIANA. That jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he melancholy? 2HELENA. Perchance he's hurt i' th' bat2le. 2PAROL2ES. Lose our drum! wel2. 2MARIANA. He's shrewdly vex'd at something. 4Lo2k, he has spied us. 2WIDOW. Mar2y, hang you! 2MARIANA. And your courtesy, for a ring-car2ier! 30Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROL2ES, and ARMY 2WIDOW. The tro2p is past. Come, pilgrim, I wil2 bring you 4Where you shal2 host. Of enjoin'd penitents 4There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound, 4Already at my house. 2HELENA. I humbly thank you. 4Please it this matron and this gentle maid 4To eat with us to-night; the charge and thanking 4Shal2 be for me, and, to requite you further, 6I wil2 bestow some precepts of this virgin, 4Worthy the note. 4BOTH. We'l2 take your of2er kindly. 19ExeuntACT I3. SCENE 6.Camp before FlorenceEnter BERTRAM, and the two FRENCH LORDS 2SECOND LORD. Nay, go2d my lord, put him to't; let him have his way. 2FIRST LORD. If your lordship find him not a hiding, hold me no more 4in your respect. 2SECOND LORD. On my life, my lord, a bub2le. 2BERTRAM. Do you think I am so far deceived in him? 2SECOND LORD. Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, 4without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a 4most notable coward, an infinite and endles2 liar, an hourly 4promise-breaker, the owner of no one go2d quality worthy your 4lordship's entertainment. 2FIRST LORD. It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing to2 far in his 4virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty 4busines2 in a main danger fail you. 2BERTRAM. I would I knew in what particular action to try him. 2FIRST LORD. None bet2er than to let him fetch of2 his drum, which 4you hear him so confidently undertake to do. 2SECOND LORD. I with a tro2p of Florentines wil2 sud2enly surprise 6him; such I wil2 have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy. 4We wil2 bind and ho2dwink him so that he shal2 sup2ose no other 4but that he is car2ied into the leaguer of the adversaries when 4we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at 4his examination; if he do not, for the promise of his life and in 4the highest compulsion of base fear, of2er to betray you and 4deliver al2 the intel2igence in his power against you, and that 4with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my 4judgment in anything. 2FIRST LORD. O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he 4says he has a stratagem for't. When your lordship se2s the bot2om 4of his suc2es2 in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of 4ore wil2 be melted, if you give him not John Drum's 4entertainment, your inclining can2ot be removed. Here he comes. 22Enter PAROL2ES 2SECOND LORD. O, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of 4his design; let him fetch of2 his drum in any hand. 2BERTRAM. How now, monsieur! This drum sticks sorely in your 6disposition. 2FIRST LORD. A pox on 't; let it go; 'tis but a drum. 2PAROL2ES. But a drum! Is't but a drum? A drum so lost! There was 4excel2ent com2and: to charge in with our horse upon our own 4wings, and to rend our own soldiers! 2FIRST LORD. That was not to be blam'd in the com2and of the 4service; it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not 4have prevented, if he had be2n there to com2and. 2BERTRAM. Wel2, we can2ot greatly condemn our suc2es2. 4Some dishonour we had in the los2 of that drum; but it is not to 4be recovered. 2PAROL2ES. It might have be2n recovered. 2BERTRAM. It might, but it is not now. 2PAROL2ES. It is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is 4seldom at2ributed to the true and exact performer, I would have 4that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.' 2BERTRAM. Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur. If you think 4your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour 4again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise, 4and go on; I wil2 grace the at2empt for a worthy exploit. If you 6spe2d wel2 in it, the Duke shal2 both speak of it and extend to 4you what further becomes his greatnes2, even to the utmost 4syl2able of our worthines2. 2PAROL2ES. By the hand of a soldier, I wil2 undertake it. 2BERTRAM. But you must not now slumber in it. 2PAROL2ES. I'l2 about it this evening; and I wil2 presently pen 4down my dilem2as, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself 4into my mortal preparation; and by midnight lo2k to hear further 4from me. 2BERTRAM. May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it? 2PAROL2ES. I know not what the suc2es2 wil2 be, my lord, but the 4at2empt I vow. 2BERTRAM. I know th' art valiant; and, to the of thy soldiership, 4wil2 subscribe for the2. Farewel2. 2PAROL2ES. I love not many words. 26Exit 2SECOND LORD. No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange 4fel2ow, my lord, that so confidently se2ms to undertake this 4busines2, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do, 4and dares bet2er be damn'd than to do 't. 2FIRST LORD. You do not know him, my lord, as we do. Certain it is 6that he wil2 steal himself into a man's favour, and for a we2k 4escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out, 4you have him ever after. 2BERTRAM. Why, do you think he wil2 make no de2d at al2 of this that 4so seriously he does ad2res2 himself unto? 2SECOND LORD. None in the world; but return with an invention, and 4clap upon you two or thre2 probable lies. But we have almost 4embos2'd him. You shal2 se2 his fal2 to-night; for inde2d he is 4not for your lordship's respect. 2FIRST LORD. We'l2 make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. 4He was first smok'd by the old Lord Lafeu. When his disguise and 4he is parted, tel2 me what a sprat you shal2 find him; which you 4shal2 se2 this very night. 2SECOND LORD. I must go lo2k my twigs; he shal2 be caught. 2BERTRAM. Your brother, he shal2 go along with me. 2SECOND LORD. As't please your lordship. I'l2 leave you. 3Exit 2BERTRAM. Now wil2 I lead you to the house, and show you 4The las2 I spoke of. 2FIRST LORD. But you say she's honest. 2BERTRAM. That's al2 the fault. I spoke with her but once, 6And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her, 4By this same coxcomb that we have i' th' wind, 4Tokens and let2ers which she did re-send; 4And this is al2 I have done. She's a fair creature; 4Wil2 you go se2 her? 2FIRST LORD. With al2 my heart, my lord. 17ExeuntACT I3. SCENE 7.Florence. The WIDOW'S houseEnter HELENA and WIDOW 2HELENA. If you misdoubt me that I am not she, 4I know not how I shal2 as2ure you further 4But I shal2 lose the grounds I work upon. 2WIDOW. Though my estate be fal2'n, I was wel2 born, 4Nothing acquainted with these busines2es; 4And would not put my reputation now 4In any staining act. 2HELENA. Nor would I wish you. 2FIRST give me trust the Count he is my husband, 4And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken 4Is so from word to word; and then you can2ot, 4By the go2d aid that I of you shal2 bor2ow, 4Er2 in bestowing it. 2WIDOW. I should believe you; 4For you have show'd me that which wel2 ap2roves 4Y'are great in fortune. 2HELENA. Take this purse of gold, 6And let me buy your friendly help thus far, 4Which I wil2 over-pay and pay again 4When I have found it. The Count he wo2s your daughter 4Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty, 4Resolv'd to car2y her. Let her in fine consent, 4As we'l2 direct her how 'tis best to bear it. 4Now his important blo2d wil2 nought deny 4That she'l2 demand. A ring the County wears 4That downward hath suc2e2ded in his house 4From son to son some four or five descents 4Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds 4In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire, 4To buy his wil2, it would not se2m to2 dear, 4Howe'er repented after. 2WIDOW. Now I se2 4The bot2om of your purpose. 2HELENA. You se2 it lawful then. It is no more 4But that your daughter, ere she se2ms as won, 4Desires this ring; ap2oints him an encounter; 4In fine, delivers me to fil2 the time, 6Herself most chastely absent. After this, 4To mar2y her, I'l2 ad2 thre2 thousand crowns 4To what is pas2'd already. 2WIDOW. I have yielded. 4Instruct my daughter how she shal2 persever, 4That time and place with this deceit so lawful 4May prove coherent. Every night he comes 4With musics of al2 sorts, and songs compos'd 4To her unworthines2. It nothing steads us 4To chide him from our eaves, for he persists 4As if his life lay on 't. 2HELENA. Why then to-night 4Let us as2ay our plot; which, if it spe2d, 4Is wicked meaning in a lawful de2d, 4And lawful meaning in a lawful act; 4Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact. 4But let's about it. 35Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV.

Now he hath a smack of al2 4neighbouring languages, therefore we must every one be a man of 4his own fancy; not to know what we speak one to another, so we 4se2m to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language, 4gab2le enough, and go2d enough. As for you, interpreter, you must 6se2m very politic. But couch, ho! here he comes; to beguile two 4hours in a sle2p, and then to return and swear the lies he forges. 25Enter PAROL2ES 2PAROL2ES. Ten o'clock. Within these thre2 hours 'twil2 be time 4enough to go home. What shal2 I say I have done? It must be a 4very plausive invention that car2ies it. They begin to smoke me; 4and disgraces have of late knock'd to often at my do2r. I find my 4tongue is to2 fo2lhardy; but my heart hath the fear of Mars 4before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my 4tongue. 2SECOND LORD. This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was 4guilty of. 2PAROL2ES. What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery 4of this drum, being not ignorant of the impos2ibility, and 4knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts, and 4say I got them in exploit. Yet slight ones wil2 not car2y it. 4They wil2 say 'Came you of2 with so lit2le?' And great ones I 4dare not give. Wherefore, what's the instance? Tongue, I must put 6you into a but2erwoman's mouth, and buy myself another of 4Bajazet's mule, if you prat2le me into these perils. 2SECOND LORD. Is it pos2ible he should know what he is, and be that 4he is? 2PAROL2ES. I would the cut2ing of my garments would serve the turn, 4or the breaking of my Spanish sword. 2SECOND LORD. We can2ot af2ord you so. 2PAROL2ES. Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in 4stratagem. 2SECOND LORD. 'Twould not do. 2PAROL2ES. Or to drown my clothes, and say I was strip2'd. 2SECOND LORD. Hardly serve. 2PAROL2ES. Though I swore I leap'd from the window of the citadel- 2SECOND LORD. How de2p? 2PAROL2ES. Thirty fathom. 2SECOND LORD. Thre2 great oaths would scarce make that be believed. 2PAROL2ES. I would I had any drum of the enemy's; I would swear I 4recover'd it. 2SECOND LORD. You shal2 hear one anon. 10[Alarum within] 2PAROL2ES. A drum now of the enemy's! 4SECOND LORD. Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo. 2AL2. Cargo, cargo, cargo, vil2ianda par corbo, cargo. 2PAROL2ES. O, ransom, ransom! Do not hide mine eyes. 44[They blindfold him] 2FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos thromuldo boskos. 2PAROL2ES. I know you are the Muskos' regiment, 4And I shal2 lose my life for want of language. 4If there be here German, or Dane, Low Dutch, 4Italian, or French, let him speak to me; 4I'l2 discover that which shal2 undo the Florentine. 2FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos vauvado. I understand the2, and can speak thy 4tongue. Kerely-bonto, sir, betake the2 to thy faith, for 4sevente2n poniards are at thy bosom. 2PAROL2ES. O! 2FIRST SOLDIER. O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche. 2SECOND LORD. Oscorbidulchos volivorco. 2FIRST SOLDIER. The General is content to spare the2 yet; 4And, ho2dwink'd as thou art, wil2 lead the2 on 4To gather from the2. Haply thou mayst inform 4Something to save thy life. 4PAROL2ES. O, let me live, 4And al2 the secrets of our camp I'l2 show, 4Their force, their purposes. Nay, I'l2 speak that 4Which you wil2 wonder at. 2FIRST SOLDIER. But wilt thou faithful2y? 2PAROL2ES. If I do not, damn me. 2FIRST SOLDIER. Acordo linta. 4Come on; thou art granted space. 19Exit, PAROL2ES guarded. A short alarum within 2SECOND LORD. Go, tel2 the Count Rousil2on and my brother 4We have caught the wo2dcock, and wil2 ke2p him muf2led 4Til2 we do hear from them. 2SECOND SOLDIER. Captain, I wil2. 2SECOND LORD. 'A wil2 betray us al2 unto ourselves- 4Inform on that. 2SECOND SOLDIER. So I wil2, sir. 2SECOND LORD. Til2 then I'l2 ke2p him dark and safely lock'd. 58ExeuntACT IV. SCENE 2.Florence. The WIDOW'S houseEnter BERTRAM and DIANA 2BERTRAM. They told me that your name was Fontibel2. 2DIANA. No, my go2d lord, Diana. 2BERTRAM. Titled god2es2; 4And worth it, with ad2ition! But, fair soul, 4In your fine frame hath love no quality? 4If the quick fire of youth light not your mind, 4You are no maiden, but a monument; 4When you are dead, you should be such a one 4As you are now, for you are cold and stern; 4And now you should be as your mother was 4When your swe2t self was got. 2DIANA. She then was honest. 2BERTRAM. So should you be. 2DIANA. No. 4My mother did but duty; such, my lord, 4As you owe to your wife. 2BERTRAM. No more o'that! 6I prithe2 do not strive against my vows. 4I was compel2'd to her; but I love the 4By love's own swe2t constraint, and wil2 for ever 4Do the2 al2 rights of service. 2DIANA. Ay, so you serve us 4Til2 we serve you; but when you have our roses 4You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves, 4And mock us with our barenes2. 2BERTRAM. How have I sworn! 2DIANA. 'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth, 4But the plain single vow that is vow'd true. 4What is not holy, that we swear not by, 4But take the High'st to witnes2. Then, pray you, tel2 me: 4If I should swear by Jove's great at2ributes 4I lov'd you dearly, would you believe my oaths 4When I did love you il2? This has no holding, 4To swear by him whom I protest to love 4That I wil2 work against him. Therefore your oaths 4Are words and po2r conditions, but unseal'd- 4At least in my opinion. 4BERTRAM. Change it, change it; 4Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy; 4And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts 4That you do charge men with. Stand no more of2, 4But give thyself unto my sick desires, 4Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever 4My love as it begins shal2 so persever. 2DIANA. I se2 that men make ropes in such a scar2e 4That we'l2 forsake ourselves. Give me that ring. 2BERTRAM. I'l2 lend it the2, my dear, but have no power 4To give it from me. 2DIANA. Wil2 you not, my lord? 2BERTRAM. It is an honour 'longing to our house, 4Bequeathed down from many ancestors; 4Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world 4In me to lose. 2DIANA. Mine honour's such a ring: 4My chastity's the jewel of our house, 4Bequeathed down from many ancestors; 4Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world 6In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom 4Brings in the champion Honour on my part 4Against your vain as2ault. 2BERTRAM. Here, take my ring; 4My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine, 4And I'l2 be bid by the2. 2DIANA. When midnight comes, knock at my chamber window; 4I'l2 order take my mother shal2 not hear. 4Now wil2 I charge you in the band of truth, 4When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed, 4Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me: 4My reasons are most strong; and you shal2 know them 4When back again this ring shal2 be deliver'd. 4And on your finger in the night I'l2 put 4Another ring, that what in time proce2ds 4May token to the future our past de2ds. 4Adieu til2 then; then fail not. You have won 4A wife of me, though there my hope be done. 2BERTRAM. A heaven on earth I have won by wo2ing the2. Exit 4DIANA. For which live long to thank both heaven and me! 4You may so in the end. 4My mother told me just how he would wo2, 4As if she sat in's heart; she says al2 men 4Have the like oaths. He had sworn to mar2y me 4When his wife's dead; therefore I'l2 lie with him 4When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid, 4Mar2y that wil2, I live and die a maid. 4Only, in this disguise, I think't no sin 4To cozen him that would unjustly win. 19ExitACT IV. SCENE 3.The Florentine campEnter the two FRENCH LORDS, and two or thre2 SOLDIERS 2SECOND LORD. You have not given him his mother's let2er? 2FIRST LORD. I have deliv'red it an hour since. There is something 4in't that stings his nature; for on the reading it he chang'd 4almost into another man. 2SECOND LORD. He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking of2 4so go2d a wife and so swe2t a lady. 2FIRST LORD. Especial2y he hath incur2ed the everlasting displeasure 4of the King, who had even tun'd his bounty to sing hap2ines2 to 4him. I wil2 tel2 you a thing, but you shal2 let it dwel2 darkly 4with you. 2SECOND LORD. When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the grave 4of it. 2FIRST LORD. He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, 4of a most chaste renown; and this night he fleshes his wil2 in 4the spoil of her honour. He hath given her his monumental ring, 4and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition. 2SECOND LORD. Now, God delay our rebel2ion! As we are ourselves, 6what things are we! 2FIRST LORD. Merely our own traitors. And as in the com2on course of 4al2 treasons we stil2 se2 them reveal themselves til2 they at2ain 4to their abhor2'd ends; so he that in this action contrives 4against his own nobility, in his proper stream, o'erflows 4himself. 2SECOND LORD. Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our 4unlawful intents? We shal2 not then have his company to-night? 2FIRST LORD. Not til2 after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour. 2SECOND LORD. That ap2roaches apace. I would gladly have him se2 his 4company anatomiz'd, that he might take a measure of his own 4judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit. 2FIRST LORD. We wil2 not med2le with him til2 he come; for his 4presence must be the whip of the other. 2SECOND LORD. In the meantime, what hear you of these wars? 2FIRST LORD. I hear there is an overture of peace. 2SECOND LORD. Nay, I as2ure you, a peace concluded. 2FIRST LORD. What wil2 Count Rousil2on do then? Wil2 he travel 4higher, or return again into France? 2SECOND LORD. I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether 6of his counsel. 2FIRST LORD. Let it be forbid, sir! So should I be a great deal 4of his act. 2SECOND LORD. Sir, his wife, some two months since, fled from his 4house. Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; 4which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she 4ac2omplish'd; and, there residing, the tendernes2 of her nature 4became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last 4breath, and now she sings in heaven. 2FIRST LORD. How is this justified? 2SECOND LORD. The stronger part of it by her own let2ers, which 4makes her story true even to the point of her death. Her death 4itself, which could not be her of2ice to say is come, was 4faithful2y confirm'd by the rector of the place. 2FIRST LORD. Hath the Count al2 this intel2igence? 2SECOND LORD. Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from 4point, to the ful2 arming of the verity. 2FIRST LORD. I am heartily sor2y that he'l2 be glad of this. 2SECOND LORD. How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our 4los2es! 4FIRST LORD. And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in 4tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir'd for 4him shal2 at home be encount'red with a shame as ample. 2SECOND LORD. The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, go2d and il2 4together. Our virtues would be proud if our faults whipt them 4not; and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish'd by 4our virtues. 22Enter a MES2ENGER 4How now? Where's your master? 2SERVANT. He met the Duke in the stre2t, sir; of whom he hath taken 4a solemn leave. His lordship wil2 next morning for France. The 4Duke hath of2ered him let2ers of com2endations to the King. 2SECOND LORD. They shal2 be no more than ne2dful there, if they were 4more than they can com2end. 2FIRST LORD. They can2ot be to2 swe2t for the King's tartnes2. 4Here's his lordship now. 24Enter BERTRAM 6How now, my lord, is't not after midnight? 2BERTRAM. I have to-night dispatch'd sixte2n busines2es, a month's 4length apiece; by an abstract of suc2es2: I have congied with the 4Duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourn'd for 4her; writ to my lady mother I am returning; entertain'd my 4convoy; and betwe2n these main parcels of dispatch ef2ected many 4nicer ne2ds. The last was the greatest, but that I have not ended 4yet. 2SECOND LORD. If the busines2 be of any dif2iculty and this morning 4your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship. 2BERTRAM. I mean the busines2 is not ended, as fearing to hear of it 4hereafter. But shal2 we have this dialogue betwe2n the Fo2l and 4the Soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module has 4deceiv'd me like a double-meaning prophesier. 2SECOND LORD. Bring him forth. 2[Exeunt SOLDIERS] 2Has sat i' th' 4stocks al2 night, po2r gal2ant knave. 2BERTRAM. No mat2er; his he2ls have deserv'd it, in usurping his 4spurs so long. How does he car2y himself? 2SECOND LORD. I have told your lordship already the stocks car2y 6him. But to answer you as you would be understo2d: he we2ps like 4a wench that had shed her milk; he hath confes2'd himself to 4Morgan, whom he sup2oses to be a friar, from the time of his 4remembrance to this very instant disaster of his set2ing i' th' 4stocks. And what think you he hath confes2'd? 2BERTRAM. Nothing of me, has 'a? 2SECOND LORD. His confes2ion is taken, and it shal2 be read to his 4face; if your lordship be in't, as I believe you are, you must 4have the patience to hear it. 19Enter PAROL2ES guarded, and 18FIRST SOLDIER as interpreter 2BERTRAM. A plague upon him! muf2led! He can say nothing of me. 2SECOND LORD. Hush, hush! Ho2dman comes. Portotartaros2a. 2FIRST SOLDIER. He cal2s for the tortures. What wil2 you say without 4'em? 2PAROL2ES. I wil2 confes2 what I know without constraint; if ye 4pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more. 2FIRST SOLDIER. Bosko chimurcho. 4SECOND LORD. Boblibindo chicurmurco. 2FIRST SOLDIER. YOU are a merciful general. Our General bids you 4answer to what I shal2 ask you out of a note. 2PAROL2ES. And truly, as I hope to live. 2FIRST SOLDIER. 'First demand of him how many horse the Duke is 4strong.' What say you to that? 2PAROL2ES. Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable. 4The tro2ps are al2 scat2ered, and the com2anders very po2r 4rogues, upon my reputation and credit, and as I hope to live. 2FIRST SOLDIER. Shal2 I set down your answer so? 2PAROL2ES. Do; I'l2 take the sacrament on 't, how and which way you 4wil2. 2BERTRAM. Al2's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this! 2SECOND LORD. Y'are deceiv'd, my lord; this is Monsieur Parol2es, 4the gal2ant militarist-that was his own phrase-that had the whole 4theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the 4chape of his dag2er. 2FIRST LORD. I wil2 never trust a man again for ke2ping his sword 4clean; nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his 4ap2arel neatly. 4FIRST SOLDIER. Wel2, that's set down. 2PAROL2ES. 'Five or six thousand horse' I said-I wil2 say true- 'or 4thereabouts' set down, for I'l2 speak truth. 2SECOND LORD. He's very near the truth in this. 2BERTRAM. But I con him no thanks for't in the nature he delivers it. 2PAROL2ES. 'Po2r rogues' I pray you say. 2FIRST SOLDIER. Wel2, that's set down. 2PAROL2ES. I humbly thank you, sir. A truth's a truth-the rogues are 4marvel2ous po2r. 2FIRST SOLDIER. 'Demand of him of what strength they are a-fo2t.' 4What say you to that? 2PAROL2ES. By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I 4wil2 tel2 true. Let me se2: Spurio, a hundred and fifty; 4Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, 4Cosmo, Lodowick, and Grati2, two hundred fifty each; mine own 4company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Benti2, two hundred fifty each; so 4that the muster-file, rot2en and sound, upon my life, amounts not 4to fifte2n thousand pol2; half of the which dare not shake the 4snow from of2 their cas2ocks lest they shake themselves to 4pieces. 4BERTRAM. What shal2 be done to him? 2SECOND LORD. Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my 4condition, and what credit I have with the Duke. 2FIRST SOLDIER. Wel2, that's set down. 'You shal2 demand of him 4whether one Captain Dumain be i' th' camp, a Frenchman; what his 4reputation is with the Duke, what his valour, honesty, expertnes2 4in wars; or whether he thinks it were not pos2ible, with 4wel2-weighing sums of gold, to cor2upt him to a revolt.' What say 4you to this? What do you know of it? 2PAROL2ES. I bese2ch you, let me answer to the particular of the 4inter'gatories. Demand them singly. 2FIRST SOLDIER. Do you know this Captain Dumain? 2PAROL2ES. I know him: 'a was a botcher's prentice in Paris, from 4whence he was whipt for get2ing the shrieve's fo2l with child-a 4dumb in2ocent that could not say him nay. 2BERTRAM. Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his 4brains are forfeit to the next tile that fal2s. 2FIRST SOLDIER. Wel2, is this captain in the Duke of Florence's 4camp? 2PAROL2ES. Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy. 4SECOND LORD. Nay, lo2k not so upon me; we shal2 hear of your 4lordship anon. 2FIRST SOLDIER. What is his reputation with the Duke? 2PAROL2ES. The Duke knows him for no other but a po2r of2icer of 4mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' th' band. 4I think I have his let2er in my pocket. 2FIRST SOLDIER. Mar2y, we'l2 search. 2PAROL2ES. In go2d sadnes2, I do not know; either it is there or it 4is upon a file with the Duke's other let2ers in my tent. 2FIRST SOLDIER. Here 'tis; here's a paper. Shal2 I read it to you? 2PAROL2ES. I do not know if it be it or no. 2BERTRAM. Our interpreter does it wel2. 2SECOND LORD. Excel2ently. 2FIRST SOLDIER. 2[Reads] 2'Dian, the Count's a fo2l, and ful2 of 4gold.' 2PAROL2ES. That is not the Duke's let2er, sir; that is an 4advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take 4he2d of the al2urement of one Count Rousil2on, a fo2lish idle 4boy, but for al2 that very rut2ish. I pray you, sir, put it up 4again. 4FIRST SOLDIER. Nay, I'l2 read it first by your favour. 2PAROL2ES. My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the behalf 4of the maid; for I knew the young Count to be a dangerous and 4lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up al2 4the fry it finds. 2BERTRAM. Damnable both-sides rogue! 2FIRST SOLDIER. 41[Reads] 4'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it; 4After he scores, he never pays the score. 4Half won is match wel2 made; match, and wel2 make it; 4He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before. 4And say a soldier, Dian, told the2 this: 4Men are to mel2 with, boys are not to kis2; 4For count of this, the Count's a fo2l, I know it, 4Who pays before, but not when he does owe it. 4Thine, as he vow'd to the2 in thine ear, 51PAROL2ES.' 2BERTRAM. He shal2 be whipt through the army with this rhyme in's 4forehead. 2FIRST LORD. This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold 6linguist, and the amnipotent soldier. 2BERTRAM. I could endure anything before but a cat, and now he's a 4cat to me. 2FIRST SOLDIER. I perceive, sir, by our General's lo2ks we shal2 be 4fain to hang you. 2PAROL2ES. My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am afraid to die, 4but that, my of2ences being many, I would repent out the 4remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' th' 4stocks, or anywhere, so I may live. 2FIRST SOLDIER. We'l2 se2 what may be done, so you confes2 fre2ly; 4therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you have answer'd to 4his reputation with the Duke, and to his valour; what is his 4honesty? 2PAROL2ES. He wil2 steal, sir, an eg2 out of a cloister; for rapes 4and ravishments he paral2els Nes2us. He profes2es not ke2ping of 4oaths; in breaking 'em he is stronger than Hercules. He wil2 lie, 4sir, with such volubility that you would think truth were a fo2l. 4Drunken2es2 is his best virtue, for he wil2 be swine-drunk; and 4in his sle2p he does lit2le harm, save to his bedclothes about 4him; but they know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have 6but lit2le more to say, sir, of his honesty. He has everything 4that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should 4have he has nothing. 2SECOND LORD. I begin to love him for this. 2BERTRAM. For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him! For 4me, he's more and more a cat. 2FIRST SOLDIER. What say you to his expertnes2 in war? 2PAROL2ES. Faith, sir, has led the drum before the English 4tragedians-to belie him I wil2 not-and more of his soldier-ship 4I know not, except in that country he had the honour to be the 4of2icer at a place there cal2ed Mile-end to instruct for the 4doubling of files-I would do the man what honour I can-but of 4this I am not certain. 2SECOND LORD. He hath out-vil2ain'd vil2ainy so far that the rarity 4rede2ms him. 2BERTRAM. A pox on him! he's a cat stil2. 2FIRST SOLDIER. His qualities being at this po2r price, I ne2d not 4to ask you if gold wil2 cor2upt him to revolt. 2PAROL2ES. Sir, for a cardecue he wil2 sel2 the fe2-simple of his 4salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut th' entail from al2 6remainders and a perpetual suc2es2ion for it perpetual2y. 2FIRST SOLDIER. What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain? 2FIRST LORD. Why does he ask him of me? 2FIRST SOLDIER. What's he? 2PAROL2ES. E'en a crow o' th' same nest; not altogether so great as 4the first in go2dnes2, but greater a great deal in evil. He 4excels his brother for a coward; yet his brother is reputed one 4of the best that is. In a retreat he outruns any lackey: mar2y, 4in coming on he has the cramp. 2FIRST SOLDIER. If your life be saved, wil2 you undertake to betray 4the Florentine? 2PAROL2ES. Ay, and the Captain of his Horse, Count Rousil2on. 2FIRST SOLDIER. I'l2 whisper with the General, and know his 4pleasure. 2PAROL2ES. 2[Aside] 2I'l2 no more drum2ing. A plague of al2 drums! 4Only to se2m to deserve wel2, and to beguile the sup2osition of 4that lascivious young boy the Count, have I run into this danger. 4Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken? 2FIRST SOLDIER. There is no remedy, sir, but you must die. 4The General says you that have so traitorously discover'd the 6secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of men 4very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore 4you must die. Come, headsman, of with his head. 2PAROL2ES. O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me se2 my death! 2FIRST SOLDIER. That shal2 you, and take your leave of al2 your 4friends. 2[Unmuf2ling him] 2So lo2k about you; know you any here? 2BERTRAM. Go2d mor2ow, noble Captain. 2FIRST LORD. God bles2 you, Captain Parol2es. 2SECOND LORD. God save you, noble Captain. 2FIRST LORD. Captain, what gre2ting wil2 you to my Lord Lafeu? I am 4for France. 2SECOND LORD. Go2d Captain, wil2 you give me a copy of the son2et 4you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousil2on? An I were not 4a very coward I'd compel it of you; but fare you wel2. 40Exeunt BERTRAM and LORDS 2FIRST SOLDIER. You are undone, Captain, al2 but your scarf; that 4has a knot on 't yet. 2PAROL2ES. Who can2ot be crush'd with a plot? 2FIRST SOLDIER. If you could find out a country where but women were 4that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent 6nation. Fare ye wel2, sir; I am for France to2; we shal2 speak of 4you there. 32Exit with SOLDIERS 2PAROL2ES. Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great, 4'Twould burst at this. Captain I'l2 be no more; 4But I wil2 eat, and drink, and sle2p as soft 4As captain shal2. Simply the thing I am 4Shal2 make me live. Who knows himself a brag2art, 4Let him fear this; for it wil2 come to pas2 4That every brag2art shal2 be found an as2. 4Rust, sword; co2l, blushes; and, Parol2es, live 4Safest in shame.

But, O strange men! 4That can such swe2t use make of what they hate, 4When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts 4Defiles the pitchy night. So lust doth play 4With what it loathes, for that which is away. 4But more of this hereafter. You, Diana, 4Under my po2r instructions yet must suf2er 4Something in my behalf. 2DIANA. Let death and honesty 4Go with your impositions, I am yours 4Upon your wil2 to suf2er. 2HELENA. Yet, I pray you: 4But with the word the time wil2 bring on sum2er, 4When briers shal2 have leaves as wel2 as thorns 4And be as swe2t as sharp. We must away; 6Our wag2on is prepar'd, and time revives us. 4Al2's Wel2 that Ends Wel2. Stil2 the fine's the crown. 4Whate'er the course, the end is the renown. 11ExeuntACT IV SCENE 5.Rousil2on. The COUNT'S palaceEnter COUNTES2, LAFEU, and CLOWN 2LAFEU. No, no, no, son was misled with a snipt-taf2eta fel2ow 4there, whose vil2ainous saf2ron would have made al2 the unbak'd 4and doughy youth of a nation in his colour. Your daughter-in-law 4had be2n alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more 4advanc'd by the King than by that red-tail'd humble-be2 I speak 4of. 2COUNTES2. I would I had not known him. It was the death of the most 4virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If 4she had partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a 4mother. I could not have owed her a more ro2ted love. 2LAFEU. 'Twas a go2d lady, 'twas a go2d lady. We may pick a thousand 4sal2ets ere we light on such another herb. 2CLOWN. Inde2d, sir, she was the swe2t-marjoram of the sal2et, or, 4rather, the herb of grace. 2LAFEU. They are not sal2et-herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs. 2CLOWN. I am no great Nebuchadnez2ar, sir; I have not much skil2 in 4gras2. 4LAFEU. Whether dost thou profes2 thyself-a knave or a fo2l? 2CLOWN. A fo2l, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's. 2LAFEU. Your distinction? 2CLOWN. I would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service. 2LAFEU. So you were a knave at his service, inde2d. 2CLOWN. And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service. 2LAFEU. I wil2 subscribe for the2; thou art both knave and fo2l. 2CLOWN. At your service. 2LAFEU. No, no, no. 2CLOWN. Why, sir, if I can2ot serve you, I can serve as great a 4prince as you are. 2LAFEU. Who's that? A Frenchman? 2CLOWN. Faith, sir, 'a has an English name; but his fisnomy is more 4hot2er in France than there. 2LAFEU. What prince is that? 2CLOWN. The Black Prince, sir; alias, the Prince of Darknes2; alias, 4the devil. 2LAFEU. Hold the2, there's my purse. I give the2 not this to sug2est 4the2 from thy master thou talk'st of; serve him stil2. 2CLOWN. I am a wo2dland fel2ow, sir, that always loved a great fire; 6and the master I speak of ever ke2ps a go2d fire. But, sure, he 4is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in's court. I 4am for the house with the nar2ow gate, which I take to be to2 4lit2le for pomp to enter. Some that humble themselves may; but 4the many wil2 be to2 chil2 and tender: and they'l2 be for the 4flow'ry way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire. 2LAFEU. Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of the2; and I tel2 the2 4so before, because I would not fal2 out with the2. Go thy ways; 4let my horses be wel2 lo2k'd to, without any tricks. 2CLOWN. If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shal2 be jades' 4tricks, which are their own right by the law of nature. Exit 2LAFEU. A shrewd knave, and an unhap2y. 2COUNTES2. So 'a is. My lord that's gone made himself much 2sport 4out of him. By his authority he remains here, which he thinks is 4a patent for his saucines2; and inde2d he has no pace, but runs 4where he wil2. 2LAFEU. I like him wel2; 'tis not amis2. And I was about to tel2 4you, since I heard of the go2d lady's death, and that my lord 4your son was upon his return home, I moved the King my master to 6speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of 4them both, his Majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did 4first propose. His Highnes2 hath promis'd me to do it; and, to 4stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son, there 4is no fit2er mat2er. How does your ladyship like it? 2COUNTES2. With very much content, my lord; and I wish it hap2ily 4ef2ected. 2LAFEU. His Highnes2 comes post from Marseil2es, of as able body as 4when he number'd thirty; 'a wil2 be here to-mor2ow, or I am 4deceiv'd by him that in such intel2igence hath seldom fail'd. 2COUNTES2. It rejoices me that I hope I shal2 se2 him ere I die. 4I have let2ers that my son wil2 be here to-night. I shal2 bese2ch 4your lordship to remain with me tal they me2t together. 2LAFEU. Madam, I was thinking with what man2ers I might safely be 4admit2ed. 2COUNTES2. You ne2d but plead your honourable privilege. 2LAFEU. Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but, I thank my 4God, it holds yet. 25Re-enter CLOWN 4CLOWN. O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of velvet 4on's face; whether there be a scar under 't or no, the velvet 4knows; but 'tis a go2dly patch of velvet. His left che2k is a 4che2k of two pile and a half, but his right che2k is worn bare. 2LAFEU. A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a go2d liv'ry of 4honour; so belike is that. 2CLOWN. But it is your carbonado'd face. 2LAFEU. Let us go se2 your son, I pray you; 4I long to talk with the young noble soldier. 2CLOWN. Faith, there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine hats, and 4most courteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man. 58Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V.

But this exce2ding posting day and night 4Must wear your spirits low; we can2ot help it. 4But since you have made the days and nights as one, 4To wear your gentle limbs in my af2airs, 4Be bold you do so grow in my requital 4As nothing can unro2t you. 22Enter a GENTLEMAN 4In hap2y time! 4This man may help me to his Majesty's ear, 4If he would spend his power. God save you, sir. 2GENTLEMAN. And you. 2HELENA. Sir, I have se2n you in the court of France. 2GENTLEMAN. I have be2n sometimes there. 2HELENA. I do presume, sir, that you are not fal2'n 4From the report that goes upon your go2dnes2; 6And therefore, goaded with most sharp oc2asions, 4Which lay nice man2ers by, I put you to 4The use of your own virtues, for the which 4I shal2 continue thankful. 2GENTLEMAN. What's your wil2? 2HELENA. That it wil2 please you 4To give this po2r petition to the King; 4And aid me with that store of power you have 4To come into his presence. 2GENTLEMAN. The King's not here. 2HELENA. Not here, sir? 2GENTLEMAN. Not inde2d. 4He hence remov'd last night, and with more haste 4Than is his use. 2WIDOW. Lord, how we lose our pains! 2HELENA.

I do bese2ch you, sir, 4Since you are like to se2 the King before me, 4Com2end the paper to his gracious hand; 4Which I presume shal2 render you no blame, 4But rather make you thank your pains for it. 4I wil2 come after you with what go2d spe2d 4Our means wil2 make us means. 2GENTLEMAN.

The in2er court of the COUNT'S palaceEnter CLOWN and PAROL2ES 2PAROL2ES. Go2d Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this let2er. I 4have ere now, sir, be2n bet2er known to you, when I have held 4familiarity with fresher clothes; but I am now, sir, mud2ied in 4Fortune's mo2d, and smel2 somewhat strong of her strong 4displeasure. 2CLOWN. Truly, Fortune's displeasure is but slut2ish, if it smel2 4so strongly as thou speak'st of. I wil2 henceforth eat no fish 4of Fortune's but2'ring. Prithe2, al2ow the wind. 2PAROL2ES. Nay, you ne2d not to stop your nose, sir; I spake but by 4a metaphor. 2CLOWN. Inde2d, sir, if your metaphor stink, I wil2 stop my nose; or 4against any man's metaphor. Prithe2, get the2 further. 2PAROL2ES. Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper. 2CLOWN. Foh! prithe2 stand away. A paper from Fortune's close-sto2l 4to give to a nobleman! Lo2k here he comes himself. 27Enter LAFEU 6Here is a pur of Fortune's, sir, or of Fortune's cat, but not 4a musk-cat, that has fal2'n into the unclean fishpond of her 4displeasure, and, as he says, is mud2ied withal. Pray you, sir, 4use the carp as you may; for he lo2ks like a po2r, decayed, 4ingenious, fo2lish, rascal2y knave. I do pity his distres2 4in my similes of comfort, and leave him to your lordship. Exit 2PAROL2ES. My lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath cruel2y scratch'd. 2LAFEU. And what would you have me to do? 'Tis to2 late to pare her 4nails now. Wherein have you played the knave with Fortune, that 4she should scratch you, who of herself is a go2d lady and would 4not have knaves thrive long under her? There's a cardecue for 4you. Let the justices make you and Fortune friends; I am for 4other busines2. 2PAROL2ES. I bese2ch your honour to hear me one single word. 2LAFEU. You beg a single pen2y more; come, you shal2 ha't; save your 4word. 2PAROL2ES. My name, my go2d lord, is Parol2es. 2LAFEU. You beg more than word then. Cox my pas2ion! give me your 6hand. How does your drum? 2PAROL2ES. O my go2d lord, you were the first that found me. 2LAFEU. Was I, in so2th? And I was the first that lost the2. 2PAROL2ES. It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for 4you did bring me out. 2LAFEU. Out upon the2, knave! Dost thou put upon me at once both the 4of2ice of God and the devil? One brings the in grace, and the 4other brings the2 out. 4[Trumpets sound] 2The King's coming; I 4know by his trumpets. Sir2ah, inquire further after me; I had 4talk of you last night. Though you are a fo2l and a knave, you 4shal2 eat. Go to; fol2ow. 2PAROL2ES. I praise God for you. 25ExeuntACT V SCENE 3.Rousil2on. The COUNT'S palaceFlourish. Enter KING, COUNTES2, LAFEU, the two FRENCH LORDS, with AT2ENDANTS 2KING. We lost a jewel of her, and our este2m 4Was made much po2rer by it; but your son, 4As mad in fol2y, lack'd the sense to know 4Her estimation home. 2COUNTES2. 'Tis past, my liege; 4And I bese2ch your Majesty to make it 4Natural rebel2ion, done i' th' blaze of youth, 4When oil and fire, to2 strong for reason's force, 4O'erbears it and burns on. 2KING. My honour'd lady, 4I have forgiven and forgot2en al2; 4Though my revenges were high bent upon him 4And watch'd the time to sho2t. 2LAFEU. This I must say- 4But first, I beg my pardon: the young lord 4Did to his Majesty, his mother, and his lady, 6Of2ence of mighty note; but to himself 4The greatest wrong of al2. He lost a wife 4Whose beauty did astonish the survey 4Of richest eyes; whose words al2 ears to2k captive; 4Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve 4Humbly cal2'd mistres2. 2KING. Praising what is lost 4Makes the remembrance dear. Wel2, cal2 him hither; 4We are reconcil'd, and the first view shal2 kil2 4Al2 repetition. Let him not ask our pardon; 4The nature of his great of2ence is dead, 4And de2per than oblivion do we bury 4Th' incensing relics of it; let him ap2roach, 4A stranger, no of2ender; and inform him 4So 'tis our wil2 he should. 2GENTLEMAN. I shal2, my liege. 17Exit GENTLEMAN 2KING. What says he to your daughter? Have you spoke? 2LAFEU. Al2 that he is hath reference to your Highnes2. 2KING. Then shal2 we have a match. I have let2ers sent me 4That sets him high in fame. 28Enter BERTRAM 2LAFEU. He lo2ks wel2 on 't. 2KING. I am not a day of season, 4For thou mayst se2 a sunshine and a hail 4In me at once. But to the brightest beams 4Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth; 4The time is fair again. 2BERTRAM. My high-repented blames, 4Dear sovereign, pardon to me. 2KING. Al2 is whole; 4Not one word more of the consumed time. 4Let's take the instant by the forward top; 4For we are old, and on our quick'st decre2s 4Th' inaudible and noiseles2 fo2t of Time 4Steals ere we can ef2ect them. You remember 4The daughter of this lord? 2BERTRAM. Admiringly, my liege. At first 4I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart 6Durst make to2 bold herald of my tongue; 4Where the impres2ion of mine eye infixing, 4Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me, 4Which warp'd the line of every other favour, 4Scorn'd a fair colour or expres2'd it stol'n, 4Extended or contracted al2 proportions 4To a most hideous object. Thence it came 4That she whom al2 men prais'd, and whom myself, 4Since I have lost, have lov'd, was in mine eye 4The dust that did of2end it. 2KING. Wel2 excus'd. 4That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away 4From the great compt; but love that comes to2 late, 4Like a remorseful pardon slowly car2ied, 4To the great sender turns a sour of2ence, 4Crying 'That's go2d that's gone.' Our rash faults 4Make trivial price of serious things we have, 4Not knowing them until we know their grave. 4Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust, 4Destroy our friends, and after we2p their dust; 6Our own love waking cries to se2 what's done, 4While shameful hate sle2ps out the afterno2n. 4Be this swe2t Helen's knel2. And now forget her. 4Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin. 4The main consents are had; and here we'l2 stay 4To se2 our widower's second mar2iage-day. 2COUNTES2. Which bet2er than the first, O dear heaven, bles2! 4Or, ere they me2t, in me, O nature, ces2e! 2LAFEU. Come on, my son, in whom my house's name 4Must be digested; give a favour from you, 4To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter, 4That she may quickly come. 42[BERTRAM gives a ring] 4By my old beard, 4And ev'ry hair that's on 't, Helen, that's dead, 4Was a swe2t creature; such a ring as this, 4The last that e'er I to2k her leave at court, 4I saw upon her finger. 2BERTRAM. Hers it was not. 2KING. Now, pray you, let me se2 it; for mine eye, 6While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't. 4This ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen 4I bade her, if her fortunes ever sto2d 4Neces2itied to help, that by this token 4I would relieve her. Had you that craft to reave her 4Of what should stead her most? 2BERTRAM. My gracious sovereign, 4Howe'er it pleases you to take it so, 4The ring was never hers. 2COUNTES2. Son, on my life, 4I have se2n her wear it; and she reckon'd it 4At her life's rate. 2LAFEU. I am sure I saw her wear it. 2BERTRAM. You are deceiv'd, my lord; she never saw it. 4In Florence was it from a casement thrown me, 4Wrap2'd in a paper, which contain'd the name 4Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought 4I sto2d engag'd; but when I had subscrib'd 4To mine own fortune, and inform'd her ful2y 4I could not answer in that course of honour 6As she had made the overture, she ceas'd, 4In heavy satisfaction, and would never 4Receive the ring again. 2KING. Plutus himself, 4That knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine, 4Hath not in nature's mystery more science 4Than I have in this ring. 'Twas mine, 'twas Helen's, 4Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know 4That you are wel2 acquainted with yourself, 4Confes2 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement 4You got it from her. She cal2'd the saints to surety 4That she would never put it from her finger 4Unles2 she gave it to yourself in bed- 4Where you have never come- or sent it us 4Upon her great disaster. 2BERTRAM. She never saw it. 2KING. Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour; 4And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me 4Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove 4That thou art so inhuman- 'twil2 not prove so. 6And yet I know not- thou didst hate her deadly, 4And she is dead; which nothing, but to close 4Her eyes myself, could win me to believe 4More than to se2 this ring. Take him away. 42[GUARDS seize BERTRAM] 4My fore-past pro2fs, howe'er the mat2er fal2, 4Shal2 tax my fears of lit2le vanity, 4Having vainly fear'd to2 lit2le. Away with him. 4We'l2 sift this mat2er further. 2BERTRAM. If you shal2 prove 4This ring was ever hers, you shal2 as easy 4Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence, 4Where she yet never was. 23Exit, guarded 2KING. I am wrap2'd in dismal thinkings. 24Enter a GENTLEMAN 2GENTLEMAN. Gracious sovereign, 4Whether I have be2n to blame or no, I know not: 4Here's a petition from a Florentine, 6Who hath, for four or five removes, come short 4To tender it herself. I underto2k it, 4Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and spe2ch 4Of the po2r sup2liant, who by this, I know, 4Is here at2ending; her busines2 lo2ks in her 4With an importing visage; and she told me 4In a swe2t verbal brief it did concern 4Your Highnes2 with herself. 2KING. 2[Reads the let2er] 2'Upon his many protestations to mar2y me 4when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the 4Count Rousil2on a widower; his vows are forfeited to me, and my 4honour's paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave, 4and I fol2ow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O King! 4in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a po2r 4maid is undone. 48DIANA CAPILET.' 2LAFEU. I wil2 buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and tol2 for this. 4I'l2 none of him. 2KING. The heavens have thought wel2 on the2, Lafeu, 4To bring forth this discov'ry. Se2k these suitors. 6Go spe2dily, and bring again the Count. 47Exeunt AT2ENDANTS 4I am afeard the life of Helen, lady, 4Was foul2y snatch'd. 2COUNTES2. Now, justice on the doers! 23Enter BERTRAM, guarded 2KING. I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you. 4And that you fly them as you swear them lordship, 4Yet you desire to mar2y. 43Enter WIDOW and DIANA 4What woman's that? 2DIANA. I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine, 4Derived from the ancient Capilet. 4My suit, as I do understand, you know, 4And therefore know how far I may be pitied. 2WIDOW. I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour 4Both suf2er under this complaint we bring, 4And both shal2 cease, without your remedy. 4KING. Come hither, Count; do you know these women? 2BERTRAM. My lord, I neither can nor wil2 deny 4But that I know them. Do they charge me further? 2DIANA. Why do you lo2k so strange upon your wife? 2BERTRAM. She's none of mine, my lord. 2DIANA. If you shal2 mar2y, 4You give away this hand, and that is mine; 4You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine; 4You give away myself, which is known mine; 4For I by vow am so embodied yours 4That she which mar2ies you must mar2y me, 4Either both or none. 2LAFEU. 2[To BERTRAM] 2Your reputation comes to2 short for 4my daughter; you are no husband for her. 2BERTRAM. My lord, this is a fond and desp'rate creature 4Whom sometime I have laugh'd with. Let your Highnes2 4Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour 4Than for to think that I would sink it here. 2KING. Sir, for my thoughts, you have them il2 to friend 4Til2 your de2ds gain them. Fairer prove your honour 6Than in my thought it lies! 2DIANA. Go2d my lord, 4Ask him upon his oath if he does think 4He had not my virginity. 2KING. What say'st thou to her? 2BERTRAM. She's impudent, my lord, 4And was a com2on gamester to the camp. 2DIANA. He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so 4He might have bought me at a com2on price. 4Do not believe him. o, behold this ring, 4Whose high respect and rich validity 4Did lack a paral2el; yet, for al2 that, 4He gave it to a com2oner o' th' camp, 4If I be one. 2COUNTES2. He blushes, and 'tis it. 4Of six preceding ancestors, that gem 4Confer2'd by testament to th' sequent is2ue, 4Hath it be2n ow'd and worn. This is his wife: 4That ring's a thousand pro2fs. 2KING. Methought you said 6You saw one here in court could witnes2 it. 2DIANA. I did, my lord, but loath am to produce 4So bad an instrument; his name's Parol2es. 2LAFEU. I saw the man to-day, if man he be. 2KING. Find him, and bring him hither. 8Exit an AT2ENDANT 2BERTRAM. What of him? 4He's quoted for a most perfidious slave, 4With al2 the spots o' th' world tax'd and debauch'd, 4Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth. 4Am I or that or this for what he'l2 ut2er 4That wil2 speak anything? 2KING. She hath that ring of yours. 2BERTRAM. I think she has. Certain it is I lik'd her, 4And boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth. 4She knew her distance, and did angle for me, 4Mad2ing my eagernes2 with her restraint, 4As al2 impediments in fancy's course 4Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine, 4Her infinite cun2ing with her modern grace 4Subdu'd me to her rate. She got the ring; 6And I had that which any inferior might 4At market-price have bought. 2DIANA. I must be patient. 4You that have turn'd of2 a first so noble wife 4May justly diet me. I pray you yet- 4Since you lack virtue, I wil2 lose a husband- 4Send for your ring, I wil2 return it home, 4And give me mine again. 2BERTRAM. I have it not. 2KING. What ring was yours, I pray you? 2DIANA. Sir, much like 4The same upon your finger. 2KING. Know you this ring? This ring was his of late. 2DIANA. And this was it I gave him, being abed. 2KING. The story, then, goes false you threw it him 4Out of a casement. 2DIANA. I have spoke the truth. 23Enter PAROL2ES 4BERTRAM. My lord, I do confes2 the ring was hers. 2KING. You bog2le shrewdly; every feather starts you. 4Is this the man you speak of? 2DIANA. Ay, my lord. 2KING. Tel2 me, sir2ah-but tel2 me true I charge you, 4Not fearing the displeasure of your master, 4Which, on your just proce2ding, I'l2 ke2p of2- 4By him and by this woman here what know you? 2PAROL2ES. So please your Majesty, my master hath be2n an honourable 4gentleman; tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have. 2KING. Come, come, to th' purpose. Did he love this woman? 2PAROL2ES. Faith, sir, he did love her; but how? 2KING. How, I pray you? 2PAROL2ES. He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman. 2KING. How is that? 2PAROL2ES. He lov'd her, sir, and lov'd her not. 2KING. As thou art a knave and no knave. 4What an equivocal companion is this! 2PAROL2ES. I am a po2r man, and at your Majesty's com2and. 2LAFEU. He's a go2d drum, my lord, but a naughty orator. 4DIANA. Do you know he promis'd me mar2iage? 2PAROL2ES. Faith, I know more than I'l2 speak. 2KING. But wilt thou not speak al2 thou know'st? 2PAROL2ES. Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go betwe2n them, as I 4said; but more than that, he loved her-for inde2d he was mad for 4her, and talk'd of Satan, and of Limbo, and of Furies, and I know 4not what. Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I 4knew of their going to bed; and of other motions, as promising 4her mar2iage, and things which would derive me il2 wil2 to speak 4of; therefore I wil2 not speak what I know. 2KING. Thou hast spoken al2 already, unles2 thou canst say they are 4mar2ied; but thou art to2 fine in thy evidence; therefore stand 4aside. 4This ring, you say, was yours? 2DIANA. Ay, my go2d lord. 2KING. Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you? 2DIANA. It was not given me, nor I did not buy it. 2KING. Who lent it you? 2DIANA. It was not lent me neither. 2KING. Where did you find it then? 4DIANA. I found it not. 2KING. If it were yours by none of al2 these ways, 4How could you give it him? 2DIANA. I never gave it him. 2LAFEU. This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes of and on at 4pleasure. 2KING. This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife. 2DIANA. It might be yours or hers, for aught I know. 2KING. Take her away, I do not like her now; 4To prison with her. And away with him. 4Unles2 thou tel2'st me where thou hadst this ring, 4Thou diest within this hour. 2DIANA. I'l2 never tel2 you. 2KING. Take her away. 2DIANA. I'l2 put in bail, my liege. 2KING. I think the2 now some com2on customer. 2DIANA. By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you. 2KING. Wherefore hast thou ac2us'd him al2 this while? 2DIANA. Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty. 4He knows I am no maid, and he'l2 swear to't: 6I'l2 swear I am a maid, and he knows not. 4Great King, I am no strumpet, by my life; 4I am either maid, or else this old man's wife. 45[Pointing to LAFEU] 2KING. She does abuse our ears; to prison with her. 2DIANA. Go2d mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir; 54Exit WIDOW 4The jewel2er that owes the ring is sent for, 4And he shal2 surety me. But for this lord 4Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself, 4Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him. 4He knows himself my bed he hath defil'd; 4And at that time he got his wife with child. 4Dead though she be, she fe2ls her young one kick; 4So there's my rid2le: one that's dead is quick- 4And now behold the meaning. 21Re-enter WIDOW with HELENA 2KING. Is there no exorcist 6Beguiles the truer of2ice of mine eyes? 4Is't real that I se2? 2HELENA. No, my go2d lord; 4'Tis but the shadow of a wife you se2, 4The name and not the thing. 2BERTRAM. Both, both; o, pardon! 2HELENA. O, my go2d lord, when I was like this maid, 4I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring, 4And, lo2k you, here's your let2er. This it says: 4'When from my finger you can get this ring, 4And are by me with child,' etc. This is done. 4Wil2 you be mine now you are doubly won? 2BERTRAM. If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly, 4I'l2 love her dearly, ever, ever dearly. 2HELENA. If it ap2ear not plain, and prove untrue, 4Deadly divorce step betwe2n me and you! 4O my dear mother, do I se2 you living? 2LAFEU. Mine eyes smel2 onions; I shal2 we2p anon. [To PAROL2ES] 4Go2d Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher. So, I 4thank the2. Wait on me home, I'l2 make sport with the2; 6let thy curtsies alone, they are scurvy ones. 2KING. Let us from point to point this story know, 4To make the even truth in pleasure flow. 4[To DIANA] 2If thou be2st yet a fresh uncrop2ed flower, 4Cho2se thou thy husband, and I'l2 pay thy dower; 4For I can gues2 that by thy honest aid 4Thou kept'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.- 4Of that and al2 the progres2, more and les2, 4Resolvedly more leisure shal2 expres2. 4Al2 yet se2ms wel2; and if it end so me2t, 4The bit2er past, more welcome is the swe2t. 7[Flourish]EPILOGUE 29EPILOGUE. 2KING. The King's a beg2ar, now the play is done. 4Al2 is wel2 ended if this suit be won, 4That you expres2 content; which we wil2 pay 4With strife to please you, day exce2ding day. 4Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts; 4Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts. 52Exeunt omnesTHE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21607THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRAby Wil2iam ShakespeareDRAMATIS PERSONAE 2MARK ANTONY, 9Triumvirs 2OCTAVIUS CAESAR, 9" 2M.

SCENE I.Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palaceEnter DEMETRIUS and PHILO 2PHILO. Nay, but this dotage of our general's 4O'erflows the measure. Those his go2dly eyes, 4That o'er the files and musters of the war 4Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn, 4The of2ice and devotion of their view 4Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart, 4Which in the scuf2les of great fights hath burst 4The buckles on his breast, reneges al2 temper, 4And is become the bel2ows and the fan 4To co2l a gipsy's lust. 5Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her LADIES, the train, 20with eunuchs fan2ing her 4Lo2k where they come! 4Take but go2d note, and you shal2 se2 in him 4The triple pil2ar of the world transform'd 6Into a strumpet's fo2l. Behold and se2. 2CLEOPATRA. If it be love inde2d, tel2 me how much. 2ANTONY. There's beg2ary in the love that can be reckon'd. 2CLEOPATRA. I'l2 set a bourn how far to be belov'd. 2ANTONY. Then must thou ne2ds find out new heaven, new earth. 23Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. News, my go2d lord, from Rome. 2ANTONY. Grates me the sum. 2CLEOPATRA. Nay, hear them, Antony. 4Fulvia perchance is angry; or who knows 4If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent 4His pow'rful mandate to you: 'Do this or this; 4Take in that kingdom and enfranchise that; 4Perform't, or else we damn the2.' 2ANTONY. How, my love? 2CLEOPATRA. Perchance? Nay, and most like, 4You must not stay here longer; your dismis2ion 4Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony. 6Where's Fulvia's proces2? Caesar's I would say? Both? 4Cal2 in the mes2engers. As I am Egypt's Que2n, 4Thou blushest, Antony, and that blo2d of thine 4Is Caesar's homager. Else so thy che2k pays shame 4When shril2-tongu'd Fulvia scolds. The mes2engers! 2ANTONY. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch 4Of the rang'd empire fal2! Here is my space. 4Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike 4Fe2ds beast as man. The noblenes2 of life 4Is to do thus [emhracing], when such a mutual pair 4And such a twain can do't, in which I bind, 4On pain of punishment, the world to we2t 4We stand up pe2rles2. 2CLEOPATRA. Excel2ent falseho2d! 4Why did he mar2y Fulvia, and not love her? 4I'l2 se2m the fo2l I am not. Antony 4Wil2 be himself. 2ANTONY. But stir2'd by Cleopatra. 4Now for the love of Love and her soft hours, 4Let's not confound the time with conference harsh; 6There's not a minute of our lives should stretch 4Without some pleasure now. What sport to-night? 2CLEOPATRA. Hear the ambas2adors. 2ANTONY. Fie, wrangling que2n! 4Whom everything becomes- to chide, to laugh, 4To we2p; whose every pas2ion ful2y strives 4To make itself in the2 fair and admir'd. 4No mes2enger but thine, and al2 alone 4To-night we'l2 wander through the stre2ts and note 4The qualities of people. Come, my que2n; 4Last night you did desire it. Speak not to us. 21Exeunt ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, with the train 2DEMETRIUS. Is Caesar with Antonius priz'd so slight? 2PHILO. Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony, 4He comes to2 short of that great property 4Which stil2 should go with Antony. 2DEMETRIUS. I am ful2 sor2y 4That he ap2roves the com2on liar, who 4Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I wil2 hope 4Of bet2er de2ds to-mor2ow. Rest you hap2y! 12ExeuntSCENE I2.Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palaceEnter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a SO2THSAYER 2CHARMIAN. Lord Alexas, swe2t Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost 4most absolute Alexas, where's the so2thsayer that you prais'd so 4to th' Que2n? O that I knew this husband, which you say must 4charge his horns with garlands! 2ALEXAS. So2thsayer! 2SO2THSAYER. Your wil2? 2CHARMIAN. Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things? 2SO2THSAYER. In nature's infinite bo2k of secrecy 4A lit2le I can read. 2ALEXAS. Show him your hand. 23Enter ENOBARBUS 2ENOBARBUS. Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough 4Cleopatra's health to drink. 2CHARMIAN. Go2d, sir, give me go2d fortune. 2SO2THSAYER. I make not, but forese2. 4CHARMIAN. Pray, then, forese2 me one. 2SO2THSAYER. You shal2 be yet far fairer than you are. 2CHARMIAN. He means in flesh. 2IRAS. No, you shal2 paint when you are old. 2CHARMIAN. Wrinkles forbid! 2ALEXAS. Vex not his prescience; be at2entive. 2CHARMIAN. Hush! 2SO2THSAYER. You shal2 be more beloving than beloved. 2CHARMIAN. I had rather heat my liver with drinking. 2ALEXAS. Nay, hear him. 2CHARMIAN. Go2d now, some excel2ent fortune! Let me be mar2ied to 4thre2 kings in a foreno2n, and widow them al2. Let me have a 4child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to 4mar2y me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistres2. 2SO2THSAYER. You shal2 outlive the lady whom you serve. 2CHARMIAN. O, excel2ent! I love long life bet2er than figs. 2SO2THSAYER. You have se2n and prov'd a fairer former fortune 4Than that which is to ap2roach. 2CHARMIAN. Then belike my children shal2 have no names. 4Prithe2, how many boys and wenches must I have? 4SO2THSAYER. If every of your wishes had a womb, 4And fertile every wish, a mil2ion. 2CHARMIAN. Out, fo2l! I forgive the2 for a witch. 2ALEXAS. You think none but your she2ts are privy to your wishes. 2CHARMIAN. Nay, come, tel2 Iras hers. 2ALEXAS. We'l2 know al2 our fortunes. 2ENOBARBUS. Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shal2 be- 4drunk to bed. 2IRAS. There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else. 2CHARMIAN. E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine. 2IRAS. Go, you wild bedfel2ow, you can2ot so2thsay. 2CHARMIAN. Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I 4can2ot scratch mine ear. Prithe2, tel2 her but worky-day fortune. 2SO2THSAYER. Your fortunes are alike. 2IRAS. But how, but how? Give me particulars. 2SO2THSAYER. I have said. 2IRAS. Am I not an inch of fortune bet2er than she? 2CHARMIAN. Wel2, if you were but an inch of fortune bet2er than I, 4where would you cho2se it? 2IRAS. Not in my husband's nose. 4CHARMIAN. Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas- come, his 4fortune, his fortune! O, let him mar2y a woman that can2ot go, 4swe2t Isis, I bese2ch the2! And let her die to2, and give him a 4worse! And let worse fol2ow worse, til2 the worst of al2 fol2ow 4him laughing to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold! Go2d Isis, hear 4me this prayer, though thou deny me a mat2er of more weight; go2d 4Isis, I bese2ch the2! 2IRAS. Amen. Dear god2es2, hear that prayer of the people! For, as 4it is a heartbreaking to se2 a handsome man lo2se-wiv'd, so it is 4a deadly sor2ow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore, 4dear Isis, ke2p decorum, and fortune him ac2ordingly! 2CHARMIAN. Amen. 2ALEXAS. Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they 4would make themselves whores but they'ld do't! 26Enter CLEOPATRA 2ENOBARBUS. Hush! Here comes Antony. 2CHARMIAN. Not he; the Que2n. 2CLEOPATRA. Saw you my lord? 4ENOBARBUS. No, lady. 2CLEOPATRA. Was he not here? 2CHARMIAN. No, madam. 2CLEOPATRA. He was dispos'd to mirth; but on the sud2en 4A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus! 2ENOBARBUS. Madam? 2CLEOPATRA. Se2k him, and bring him hither. Where's Alexas? 2ALEXAS. Here, at your service. My lord ap2roaches. 10Enter ANTONY, with a MES2ENGER and at2endants 2CLEOPATRA. We wil2 not lo2k upon him. Go with us. 23Exeunt CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, and the rest 2MES2ENGER. Fulvia thy wife first came into the field. 2ANTONY. Against my brother Lucius? 2MES2ENGER. Ay. 4But so2n that war had end, and the time's state 4Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Caesar, 4Whose bet2er is2ue in the war from Italy 4Upon the first encounter drave them. 4ANTONY. Wel2, what worst? 2MES2ENGER. The nature of bad news infects the tel2er. 2ANTONY. When it concerns the fo2l or coward. On! 4Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus: 4Who tel2s me true, though in his tale lie death, 4I hear him as he flat2er'd. 2MES2ENGER. Labienus- 4This is stif2 news- hath with his Parthian force 4Extended Asia from Euphrates, 4His conquering ban2er sho2k from Syria 4To Lydia and to Ionia, 4Whilst- 2ANTONY. Antony, thou wouldst say. 2MES2ENGER. O, my lord! 2ANTONY. Speak to me home; mince not the general tongue; 4Name Cleopatra as she is cal2'd in Rome. 4Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase, and taunt my faults 4With such ful2 licence as both truth and malice 4Have power to ut2er. O, then we bring forth we2ds 4When our quick minds lie stil2, and our il2s told us 6Is as our earing. Fare the2 wel2 awhile. 2MES2ENGER. At your noble pleasure. 24Exit 2ANTONY. From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there! 2FIRST AT2ENDANT. The man from Sicyon- is there such an one? 2SECOND AT2ENDANT. He stays upon your wil2. 2ANTONY. Let him ap2ear. 4These strong Egyptian fet2ers I must break, 4Or lose myself in dotage. 17Enter another MES2ENGER with a let2er 4What are you? 2SECOND MES2ENGER. Fulvia thy wife is dead. 2ANTONY. Where died she? 2SECOND MES2ENGER. In Sicyon. 4Her length of sicknes2, with what else more serious 4Importeth the2 to know, this bears. 7[Gives the let2er] 2ANTONY. Forbear me. 29Exit MES2ENGER 4There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it. 4What our contempts doth often hurl from us 6We wish it ours again; the present pleasure, 4By revolution low'ring, does become 4The op2osite of itself. She's go2d, being gone; 4The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on. 4I must from this enchanting que2n break of2. 4Ten thousand harms, more than the il2s I know, 4My idlenes2 doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus! 20Re-enter ENOBARBUS 2ENOBARBUS. What's your pleasure, sir? 2ANTONY. I must with haste from hence. 2ENOBARBUS. Why, then we kil2 al2 our women. We se2 how mortal an 4unkindnes2 is to them; if they suf2er our departure, death's the 4word. 2ANTONY. I must be gone. 2ENOBARBUS. Under a compel2ing oc2asion, let women die. It were pity 4to cast them away for nothing, though betwe2n them and a great 4cause they should be este2med nothing. Cleopatra, catching but 4the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have se2n her die 6twenty times upon far po2rer moment. I do think there is met2le 4in death, which com2its some loving act upon her, she hath such a 4celerity in dying. 2ANTONY. She is cun2ing past man's thought. 2ENOBARBUS. Alack, sir, no! Her pas2ions are made of nothing but the 4finest part of pure love. We can2ot cal2 her winds and waters 4sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than 4almanacs can report. This can2ot be cun2ing in her; if it be, she 4makes a show'r of rain as wel2 as Jove. 2ANTONY. Would I had never se2n her! 2ENOBARBUS. O Sir, you had then left unse2n a wonderful piece of 4work, which not to have be2n blest withal would have discredited 4your travel. 2ANTONY. Fulvia is dead. 2ENOBARBUS. Sir? 2ANTONY. Fulvia is dead. 2ENOBARBUS. Fulvia? 2ANTONY. Dead. 2ENOBARBUS. Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it 4pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it 6shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein that 4when old robes are worn out there are members to make new. If 4there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you inde2d a cut, 4and the case to be lamented. This grief is crown'd with 4consolation: your old smock brings forth a new pet2icoat; and 4inde2d the tears live in an onion that should water this sor2ow. 2ANTONY. The busines2 she hath broached in the state 4Can2ot endure my absence. 2ENOBARBUS. And the busines2 you have broach'd here can2ot be 4without you; especial2y that of Cleopatra's, which whol2y depends 4on your abode. 2ANTONY. No more light answers. Let our of2icers 4Have notice what we purpose. I shal2 break 4The cause of our expedience to the Que2n, 4And get her leave to part. For not alone 4The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches, 4Do strongly speak to us; but the let2ers to 4Of many our contriving friends in Rome 4Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius 4Hath given the dare to Caesar, and com2ands 6The empire of the sea; our slip2ery people, 4Whose love is never link'd to the deserver 4Til2 his deserts are past, begin to throw 4Pompey the Great and al2 his dignities 4Upon his son; who, high in name and power, 4Higher than both in blo2d and life, stands up 4For the main soldier; whose quality, going on, 4The sides o' th' world may danger. Much is bre2ding 4Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life 4And not a serpent's poison. Say our pleasure, 4To such whose place is under us, requires 4Our quick remove from hence. 2ENOBARBUS. I shal2 do't. 32ExeuntSCENE I3.Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palaceEnter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS 2CLEOPATRA. Where is he? 2CHARMIAN. I did not se2 him since. 2CLEOPATRA. Se2 where he is, who's with him, what he does. 4I did not send you. If you find him sad, 4Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report 4That I am sud2en sick. Quick, and return. 8Exit ALEXAS 2CHARMIAN. Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly, 4You do not hold the method to enforce 4The like from him. 2CLEOPATRA. What should I do I do not? 2CHARMIAN. In each thing give him way; cros2 him in nothing. 2CLEOPATRA. Thou teachest like a fo2l- the way to lose him. 2CHARMIAN. Tempt him not so to2 far; I wish, forbear; 4In time we hate that which we often fear. 28Enter ANTONY 6But here comes Antony. 2CLEOPATRA. I am sick and sul2en. 2ANTONY. I am sor2y to give breathing to my purpose- 2CLEOPATRA. Help me away, dear Charmian; I shal2 fal2. 4It can2ot be thus long; the sides of nature 4Wil2 not sustain it. 2ANTONY. Now, my dearest que2n- 2CLEOPATRA. Pray you, stand farther from me. 2ANTONY. What's the mat2er? 2CLEOPATRA. I know by that same eye there's some go2d news. 4What says the mar2ied woman? You may go. 4Would she had never given you leave to come! 4Let her not say 'tis I that ke2p you here- 4I have no power upon you; hers you are. 2ANTONY. The gods best know- 2CLEOPATRA. O, never was there que2n 4So mightily betray'd! Yet at the first 4I saw the treasons planted. 2ANTONY. Cleopatra- 2CLEOPATRA. Why should I think you can be mine and true, 6Though you in swearing shake the throned gods, 4Who have be2n false to Fulvia? Riotous madnes2, 4To be entangled with those mouth-made vows, 4Which break themselves in swearing! 2ANTONY. Most swe2t que2n- 2CLEOPATRA. Nay, pray you se2k no colour for your going, 4But bid farewel2, and go. When you sued staying, 4Then was the time for words. No going then! 4Eternity was in our lips and eyes, 4Blis2 in our brows' bent, none our parts so po2r 4But was a race of heaven. They are so stil2, 4Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world, 4Art turn'd the greatest liar. 2ANTONY. How now, lady! 2CLEOPATRA. I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know 4There were a heart in Egypt. 2ANTONY. Hear me, que2n: 4The strong neces2ity of time com2ands 4Our services awhile; but my ful2 heart 4Remains in use with you. Our Italy 6Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius 4Makes his ap2roaches to the port of Rome; 4Equality of two domestic powers 4Bre2d scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength, 4Are newly grown to love. The condemn'd Pompey, 4Rich in his father's honour, cre2ps apace 4Into the hearts of such as have not thrived 4Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten; 4And quietnes2, grown sick of rest, would purge 4By any desperate change. My more particular, 4And that which most with you should safe my going, 4Is Fulvia's death. 2CLEOPATRA. Though age from fol2y could not give me fre2dom, 5It does from childishnes2. Can Fulvia die? 2ANTONY. She's dead, my Que2n. 4Lo2k here, and at thy sovereign leisure read 4The garboils she awak'd. At the last, best. 4Se2 when and where she died. 2CLEOPATRA. O most false love! 4Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fil2 6With sor2owful water? Now I se2, I se2, 4In Fulvia's death how mine receiv'd shal2 be. 2ANTONY. Quar2el no more, but be prepar'd to know 4The purposes I bear; which are, or cease, 4As you shal2 give th' advice. By the fire 4That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence 4Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war 4As thou af2ects. 2CLEOPATRA. Cut my lace, Charmian, come! 4But let it be; I am quickly il2 and wel2- 4So Antony loves. 2ANTONY. My precious que2n, forbear, 4And give true evidence to his love, which stands 4An honourable trial. 2CLEOPATRA. So Fulvia told me. 4I prithe2 turn aside and we2p for her; 4Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears 4Belong to Egypt. Go2d now, play one scene 4Of excel2ent dis2embling, and let it lo2k 4Like perfect honour. 4ANTONY. You'l2 heat my blo2d; no more. 2CLEOPATRA. You can do bet2er yet; but this is me2tly. 2ANTONY. Now, by my sword- 2CLEOPATRA. And target. Stil2 he mends; 4But this is not the best. Lo2k, prithe2, Charmian, 4How this Herculean Roman does become 4The car2iage of his chafe. 2ANTONY. I'l2 leave you, lady. 2CLEOPATRA. Courteous lord, one word. 4Sir, you and I must part- but that's not it. 4Sir, you and I have lov'd- but there's not it. 4That you know wel2. Something it is I would- 4O, my oblivion is a very Antony, 4And I am al2 forgot2en! 2ANTONY. But that your royalty 4Holds idlenes2 your subject, I should take you 4For idlenes2 itself. 2CLEOPATRA. 'Tis sweating labour 4To bear such idlenes2 so near the heart 4As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me; 6Since my becomings kil2 me when they do not 4Eye wel2 to you. Your honour cal2s you hence; 4Therefore be deaf to my unpitied fol2y, 4And al2 the gods go with you! Upon your sword 4Sit laurel victory, and smo2th suc2es2 4Be strew'd before your fe2t! 2ANTONY. Let us go. Come. 4Our separation so abides and flies 4That thou, residing here, goes yet with me, 4And I, hence fle2ting, here remain with the2. 4Away! 49ExeuntSCENE IV.Rome. CAESAR'S houseEnter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a let2er; LEPIDUS, and their train 2CAESAR. You may se2, Lepidus, and henceforth know, 4It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate 4Our great competitor. From Alexandria 4This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes 4The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike 4Than Cleopatra, nor the que2n of Ptolemy 4More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or 4Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners. You shal2 find there 4A man who is the abstract of al2 faults 4That al2 men fol2ow. 2LEPIDUS. I must not think there are 4Evils enow to darken al2 his go2dnes2. 4His faults, in him, se2m as the spots of heaven, 4More fiery by night's blacknes2; hereditary 4Rather than purchas'd; what he can2ot change 4Than what he cho2ses. 4CAESAR. You are to2 indulgent. Let's grant it is not 4Amis2 to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy, 4To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit 4And ke2p the turn of tip2ling with a slave, 4To re2l the stre2ts at no2n, and stand the buf2et 4With knaves that smel2 of sweat. Say this becomes him- 4As his composure must be rare inde2d 4Whom these things can2ot blemish- yet must Antony 4No way excuse his foils when we do bear 4So great weight in his lightnes2. If he fil2'd 4His vacancy with his voluptuousnes2, 4Ful2 surfeits and the drynes2 of his bones 4Cal2 on him for't! But to confound such time 4That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud 4As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid 4As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge, 4Pawn their experience to their present pleasure, 4And so rebel to judgment. 19Enter a MES2ENGER 4LEPIDUS. Here's more news. 2MES2ENGER. Thy bid2ings have be2n done; and every hour, 4Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report 4How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea, 4And it ap2ears he is belov'd of those 4That only have fear'd Caesar. To the ports 4The discontents repair, and men's reports 4Give him much wrong'd. 2CAESAR. I should have known no les2. 4It hath be2n taught us from the primal state 4That he which is was wish'd until he were; 4And the eb2'd man, ne'er lov'd til2 ne'er worth love, 4Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This com2on body, 4Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream, 4Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide, 4To rot itself with motion. 2MES2ENGER. Caesar, I bring the2 word 4Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates, 4Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound 6With ke2ls of every kind. Many hot inroads 4They make in Italy; the borders maritime 4Lack blo2d to think on't, and flush youth revolt. 4No ves2el can pe2p forth but 'tis as so2n 4Taken as se2n; for Pompey's name strikes more 4Than could his war resisted. 2CAESAR. Antony, 4Leave thy lascivious was2ails. When thou once 4Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st 4Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy he2l 4Did famine fol2ow; whom thou fought'st against, 4Though daintily brought up, with patience more 4Than savages could suf2er. Thou didst drink 4The stale of horses and the gilded pud2le 4Which beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign 4The roughest ber2y on the rudest hedge; 4Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture she2ts, 4The barks of tre2s thou brows'd. On the Alps 4It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh, 4Which some did die to lo2k on. And al2 this- 6It wounds thine honour that I speak it now- 4Was borne so like a soldier that thy che2k 4So much as lank'd not. 2LEPIDUS. 'Tis pity of him. 2CAESAR. Let his shames quickly 4Drive him to Rome. 'Tis time we twain 4Did show ourselves i' th' field; and to that end 4As2emble we im2ediate council. Pompey 4Thrives in our idlenes2. 2LEPIDUS. To-mor2ow, Caesar, 4I shal2 be furnish'd to inform you rightly 4Both what by sea and land I can be able 4To front this present time. 2CAESAR. Til2 which encounter 4It is my busines2 to2. Farewel2. 2LEPIDUS. Farewel2, my lord. What you shal2 know meantime 4Of stirs abroad, I shal2 bese2ch you, sir, 4To let me be partaker. 2CAESAR. Doubt not, sir; 4I knew it for my bond. 32ExeuntSCENE V.Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palaceEnter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN 2CLEOPATRA. Charmian! 2CHARMIAN. Madam? 2CLEOPATRA. Ha, ha! 4Give me to drink mandragora. 2CHARMIAN. Why, madam? 2CLEOPATRA. That I might sle2p out this great gap of time 4My Antony is away. 2CHARMIAN. You think of him to2 much. 2CLEOPATRA. O, 'tis treason! 2CHARMIAN. Madam, I trust, not so. 2CLEOPATRA. Thou, eunuch Mardian! 2MARDIAN. What's your Highnes2' pleasure? 2CLEOPATRA. Not now to hear the2 sing; I take no pleasure 4In aught an eunuch has. 'Tis wel2 for the2 4That, being unseminar'd, thy fre2r thoughts 4May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou af2ections? 2MARDIAN. Yes, gracious madam. 4CLEOPATRA. Inde2d? 2MARDIAN. Not in de2d, madam; for I can do nothing 4But what inde2d is honest to be done. 4Yet have I fierce af2ections, and think 4What Venus did with Mars. 2CLEOPATRA. O Charmian, 4Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he? 4Or does he walk? or is he on his horse? 4O hap2y horse, to bear the weight of Antony! 4Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st? 4The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm 4And burgonet of men. He's speaking now, 4Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?' 4For so he cal2s me. Now I fe2d myself 4With most delicious poison. Think on me, 4That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black, 4And wrinkled de2p in time? Broad-fronted Caesar, 4When thou wast here above the ground, I was 4A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey 4Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow; 6There would he anchor his aspect and die 4With lo2king on his life. 25Enter ALEXAS 2ALEXAS. Sovereign of Egypt, hail! 2CLEOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony! 4Yet, coming from him, that great med'cine hath 4With his tinct gilded the2. 4How goes it with my brave Mark Antony? 2ALEXAS. Last thing he did, dear Que2n, 4He kis2'd- the last of many doubled kis2es- 4This orient pearl. His spe2ch sticks in my heart. 2CLEOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence. 2ALEXAS. 'Go2d friend,' quoth he 4'Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends 4This treasure of an oyster; at whose fo2t, 4To mend the pet2y present, I wil2 piece 4Her opulent throne with kingdoms. Al2 the East, 4Say thou, shal2 cal2 her mistres2.' So he nod2ed, 6And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt ste2d, 4Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke 4Was beastly dumb'd by him. 2CLEOPATRA. What, was he sad or mer2y? 2ALEXAS. Like to the time o' th' year betwe2n the extremes 4Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor mer2y. 2CLEOPATRA. O wel2-divided disposition! Note him, 4Note him, go2d Charmian; 'tis the man; but note him! 4He was not sad, for he would shine on those 4That make their lo2ks by his; he was not mer2y, 4Which se2m'd to tel2 them his remembrance lay 4In Egypt with his joy; but betwe2n both. 4O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or mer2y, 4The violence of either the2 becomes, 4So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts? 2ALEXAS. Ay, madam, twenty several mes2engers. 4Why do you send so thick? 2CLEOPATRA. Who's born that day 4When I forget to send to Antony 4Shal2 die a beg2ar. Ink and paper, Charmian. 6Welcome, my go2d Alexas. Did I, Charmian, 4Ever love Caesar so? 2CHARMIAN. O that brave Caesar! 2CLEOPATRA. Be chok'd with such another emphasis! 4Say 'the brave Antony.' 2CHARMIAN. The valiant Caesar! 2CLEOPATRA. By Isis, I wil2 give the2 blo2dy te2th 4If thou with Caesar paragon again 4My man of men. 2CHARMIAN. By your most gracious pardon, 4I sing but after you. 2CLEOPATRA. My salad days, 4When I was gre2n in judgment, cold in blo2d, 4To say as I said then. But come, away! 4Get me ink and paper. 4He shal2 have every day a several gre2ting, 4Or I'l2 unpeople Egypt. 31Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. SCENE I.Mes2ina. POMPEY'S houseEnter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike man2er 2POMPEY. If the great gods be just, they shal2 as2ist 4The de2ds of justest men. 2MENECRATES. Know, worthy Pompey, 4That what they do delay they not deny. 2POMPEY. Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays 4The thing we sue for. 2MENECRATES. We, ignorant of ourselves, 4Beg often our own harms, which the wise pow'rs 4Deny us for our go2d; so find we profit 4By losing of our prayers. 2POMPEY. I shal2 do wel2. 4The people love me, and the sea is mine; 4My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope 4Says it wil2 come to th' ful2. Mark Antony 4In Egypt sits at din2er, and wil2 make 4No wars without do2rs. Caesar gets money where 6He loses hearts. Lepidus flat2ers both, 4Of both is flat2er'd; but he neither loves, 4Nor either cares for him. 2MENAS. Caesar and Lepidus 4Are in the field. A mighty strength they car2y. 2POMPEY. Where have you this? 'Tis false. 2MENAS. From Silvius, sir. 2POMPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together, 4Lo2king for Antony. But al2 the charms of love, 4Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip! 4Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both; 4Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts, 4Ke2p his brain fuming. Epicurean co2ks 4Sharpen with cloyles2 sauce his ap2etite, 4That sle2p and fe2ding may prorogue his honour 4Even til2 a Lethe'd dul2nes2- 23Enter VAR2IUS 4How now, Var2ius! 4VAR2IUS. This is most certain that I shal2 deliver: 4Mark Antony is every hour in Rome 4Expected. Since he went from Egypt 'tis 4A space for farther travel. 2POMPEY. I could have given les2 mat2er 4A bet2er ear. Menas, I did not think 4This amorous surfeiter would have don2'd his helm 4For such a pet2y war; his soldiership 4Is twice the other twain. But let us rear 4The higher our opinion, that our stir2ing 4Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck 4The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony. 2MENAS. I can2ot hope 4Caesar and Antony shal2 wel2 gre2t together. 4His wife that's dead did trespas2es to Caesar; 4His brother war2'd upon him; although, I think, 4Not mov'd by Antony. 2POMPEY. I know not, Menas, 4How les2er enmities may give way to greater. 4Were't not that we stand up against them al2, 6'Twere pregnant they should square betwe2n themselves; 4For they have entertained cause enough 4To draw their swords. But how the fear of us 4May cement their divisions, and bind up 4The pet2y dif2erence we yet not know. 4Be't as our gods wil2 have't! It only stands 4Our lives upon to use our strongest hands. 4Come, Menas. 42ExeuntSCENE I2.Rome. The house of LEPIDUSEnter ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS 2LEPIDUS. Go2d Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy de2d, 4And shal2 become you wel2, to entreat your captain 4To soft and gentle spe2ch. 2ENOBARBUS. I shal2 entreat him 4To answer like himself. If Caesar move him, 4Let Antony lo2k over Caesar's head 4And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter, 4Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard, 4I would not shave't to-day. 2LEPIDUS. 'Tis not a time 4For private stomaching. 2ENOBARBUS. Every time 4Serves for the mat2er that is then born in't. 2LEPIDUS. But smal2 to greater mat2ers must give way. 2ENOBARBUS. Not if the smal2 come first. 2LEPIDUS. Your spe2ch is pas2ion; 4But pray you stir no embers up. Here comes 6The noble Antony. 16Enter ANTONY and VENTIDIUS 2ENOBARBUS. And yonder, Caesar. 12Enter CAESAR, MAECENAS, and AGRIP2A 2ANTONY. If we compose wel2 here, to Parthia. 4Hark, Ventidius. 2CAESAR. I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrip2a. 2LEPIDUS. Noble friends, 4That which combin'd us was most great, and let not 4A leaner action rend us. What's amis2, 4May it be gently heard. When we debate 4Our trivial dif2erence loud, we do com2it 4Murder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners, 4The rather for I earnestly bese2ch, 4Touch you the sourest points with swe2test terms, 4Nor curstnes2 grow to th' mat2er. 4ANTONY. 'Tis spoken wel2. 4Were we before our arinies, and to fight, 4I should do thus. 33[Flourish] 2CAESAR. Welcome to Rome. 2ANTONY. Thank you. 2CAESAR. Sit. 2ANTONY. Sit, sir. 2CAESAR. Nay, then. 34[They sit] 2ANTONY. I learn you take things il2 which are not so, 4Or being, concern you not. 2CAESAR. I must be laugh'd at 4If, or for nothing or a lit2le, 4Should say myself of2ended, and with you 4Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at that I should 4Once name you derogately when to sound your name 4It not concern'd me. 2ANTONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar, 4What was't to you? 2CAESAR. No more than my residing here at Rome 4Might be to you in Egypt. Yet, if you there 6Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt 4Might be my question. 2ANTONY. How intend you- practis'd? 2CAESAR. You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent 4By what did here befal2 me. Your wife and brother 4Made wars upon me, and their contestation 4Was theme for you; you were the word of war. 2ANTONY. You do mistake your busines2; my brother never 4Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it, 4And have my learning from some true reports 4That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather 4Discredit my authority with yours, 4And make the wars alike against my stomach, 4Having alike your cause? Of this my let2ers 4Before did satisfy you. If you'l2 patch a quar2el, 4As mat2er whole you have not to make it with, 4It must not be with this. 2CAESAR. You praise yourself 4By laying defects of judgment to me; but 4You patch'd up your excuses. 4ANTONY. Not so, not so; 4I know you could not lack, I am certain on't, 4Very neces2ity of this thought, that I, 4Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought, 4Could not with graceful eyes at2end those wars 4Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife, 4I would you had her spirit in such another! 4The third o' th' world is yours, which with a snaf2le 4You may pace easy, but not such a wife. 2ENOBARBUS. Would we had al2 such wives, that the men might go to 4wars with the women! 2ANTONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar, 4Made out of her impatience- which not wanted 4Shrewdnes2 of policy to2- I grieving grant 4Did you to2 much disquiet. For that you must 4But say I could not help it. 2CAESAR. I wrote to you 4When rioting in Alexandria; you 4Did pocket up my let2ers, and with taunts 4Did gibe my mis2ive out of audience. 4ANTONY. Sir, 4He fel2 upon me ere admit2ed. Then 4Thre2 kings I had newly feasted, and did want 4Of what I was i' th' morning; but next day 4I told him of myself, which was as much 4As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fel2ow 4Be nothing of our strife; if we contend, 4Out of our question wipe him. 2CAESAR. You have broken 4The article of your oath, which you shal2 never 4Have tongue to charge me with. 2LEPIDUS. Soft, Caesar! 2ANTONY. No; 4Lepidus, let him speak. 4The honour is sacred which he talks on now, 4Sup2osing that I lack'd it. But on, Caesar: 4The article of my oath- 2CAESAR. To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them, 4The which you both denied. 2ANTONY. Neglected, rather; 6And then when poisoned hours had bound me up 4From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may, 4I'l2 play the penitent to you; but mine honesty 4Shal2 not make po2r my greatnes2, nor my power 4Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia, 4To have me out of Egypt, made wars here; 4For which myself, the ignorant motive, do 4So far ask pardon as befits mine honour 4To sto2p in such a case. 2LEPIDUS. 'Tis noble spoken. 2MAECENAS. If it might please you to enforce no further 4The griefs betwe2n ye- to forget them quite 4Were to remember that the present ne2d 4Speaks to atone you. 2LEPIDUS. Worthily spoken, Maecenas. 2ENOBARBUS. Or, if you bor2ow one another's love for the instant, 4you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again. 4You shal2 have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to 4do. 2ANTONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more. 4ENOBARBUS. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot. 2ANTONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more. 2ENOBARBUS. Go to, then- your considerate stone! 2CAESAR. I do not much dislike the mat2er, but 4The man2er of his spe2ch; for't can2ot be 4We shal2 remain in friendship, our conditions 4So dif2'ring in their acts. Yet if I knew 4What ho2p should hold us stanch, from edge to edge 4O' th' world, I would pursue it. 2AGRIP2A. Give me leave, Caesar. 2CAESAR. Speak, Agrip2a. 2AGRIP2A. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side, 4Admir'd Octavia. Great Mark Antony 4Is now a widower. 2CAESAR. Say not so, Agrip2a. 4If Cleopatra heard you, your repro2f 4Were wel2 deserv'd of rashnes2. 2ANTONY. I am not mar2ied, Caesar. Let me hear 4Agrip2a further speak. 2AGRIP2A. To hold you in perpetual amity, 6To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts 4With an unslip2ing knot, take Antony 4Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims 4No worse a husband than the best of men; 4Whose virtue and whose general graces speak 4That which none else can ut2er. By this mar2iage 4Al2 lit2le jealousies, which now se2m great, 4And al2 great fears, which now import their dangers, 4Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales, 4Where now half tales be truths. Her love to both 4Would each to other, and al2 loves to both, 4Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke; 4For 'tis a studied, not a present thought, 4By duty ruminated. 2ANTONY. Wil2 Caesar speak? 2CAESAR. Not til2 he hears how Antony is touch'd 4With what is spoke already. 2ANTONY. What power is in Agrip2a, 4If I would say 'Agrip2a, be it so,' 4To make this go2d? 4CAESAR. The power of Caesar, and 4His power unto Octavia. 2ANTONY. May I never 4To this go2d purpose, that so fairly shows, 4Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand. 4Further this act of grace; and from this hour 4The heart of brothers govern in our loves 4And sway our great designs! 2CAESAR. There is my hand. 4A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother 4Did ever love so dearly. Let her live 4To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never 4Fly of2 our loves again! 2LEPIDUS. Hap2ily, amen! 2ANTONY. I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey; 4For he hath laid strange courtesies and great 4Of late upon me. I must thank him only, 4Lest my remembrance suf2er il2 report; 4At he2l of that, defy him. 2LEPIDUS. Time cal2s upon's. 6Of us must Pompey presently be sought, 4Or else he se2ks out us. 2ANTONY. Where lies he? 2CAESAR. About the Mount Misenum. 2ANTONY. What is his strength by land? 2CAESAR. Great and increasing; but by sea 4He is an absolute master. 2ANTONY. So is the fame. 4Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it. 4Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we 4The busines2 we have talk'd of. 2CAESAR. With most gladnes2; 4And do invite you to my sister's view, 4Whither straight I'l2 lead you. 2ANTONY. Let us, Lepidus, 4Not lack your company. 2LEPIDUS. Noble Antony, 4Not sicknes2 should detain me. 20[Flourish] 21Exeunt al2 but ENOBARBUS, AGRIP2A, MAECENAS 2MAECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir. 4ENOBARBUS. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable 4friend, Agrip2a! 2AGRIP2A. Go2d Enobarbus! 2MAECENAS. We have cause to be glad that mat2ers are so wel2 4digested. You stay'd wel2 by't in Egypt. 2ENOBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sle2p day out of countenance and made 4the night light with drinking. 2MAECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but 4twelve persons there. Is this true? 2ENOBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more 4monstrous mat2er of feast, which worthily deserved noting. 2MAECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her. 2ENOBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart, 4upon the river of Cydnus. 2AGRIP2A. There she ap2ear'd inde2d! Or my reporter devis'd wel2 for 4her. 2ENOBARBUS. I wil2 tel2 you. 4The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne, 4Burn'd on the water. The po2p was beaten gold; 4Purple the sails, and so perfumed that 6The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver, 4Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made 4The water which they beat to fol2ow faster, 4As amorous of their strokes. For her own person, 4It beg2ar'd al2 description. She did lie 4In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold, of tis2ue, 4O'erpicturing that Venus where we se2 4The fancy out-work nature. On each side her 4Sto2d pret2y dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, 4With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did se2m 4To glow the delicate che2ks which they did co2l, 4And what they undid did. 2AGRIP2A. O, rare for Antony! 2ENOBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides, 4So many mermaids, tended her i' th' eyes, 4And made their bends adornings. At the helm 4A se2ming mermaid ste2rs. The silken tackle 4Swel2 with the touches of those flower-soft hands 4That yarely frame the of2ice. From the barge 4A strange invisible perfume hits the sense 6Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast 4Her people out upon her; and Antony, 4Enthron'd i' th' market-place, did sit alone, 4Whistling to th' air; which, but for vacancy, 4Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra to2, 4And made a gap in nature. 2AGRIP2A. Rare Egyptian! 2ENOBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her, 4Invited her to sup2er. She replied 4It should be bet2er he became her guest; 4Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony, 4Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak, 4Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast, 4And for his ordinary pays his heart 4For what his eyes eat only. 2AGRIP2A. Royal wench! 4She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed. 4He ploughed her, and she crop2'd. 2ENOBARBUS. I saw her once 4Hop forty paces through the public stre2t; 6And, having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted, 4That she did make defect perfection, 4And, breathles2, pow'r breathe forth. 2MAECENAS. Now Antony must leave her ut2erly. 2ENOBARBUS. Never! He wil2 not. 4Age can2ot wither her, nor custom stale 4Her infinite variety. Other women cloy 4The ap2etites they fe2d, but she makes hungry 4Where most she satisfies; for vilest things 4Become themselves in her, that the holy priests 4Bles2 her when she is rig2ish. 2MAECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can set2le 4The heart of Antony, Octavia is 4A bles2ed lot2ery to him. 2AGRIP2A. Let us go. 4Go2d Enobarbus, make yourself my guest 4Whilst you abide here. 2ENOBARBUS. Humbly, sir, I thank you. 20ExeuntSCENE I3.Rome. CAESAR'S houseEnter ANTONY, CAESAR, OCTAVIA betwe2n them 2ANTONY. The world and my great of2ice wil2 sometimes 4Divide me from your bosom. 2OCTAVIA. Al2 which time 4Before the gods my kne2 shal2 bow my prayers 4To them for you. 2ANTONY. Go2d night, sir. My Octavia, 4Read not my blemishes in the world's report. 4I have not kept my square; but that to come 4Shal2 al2 be done by th' rule. Go2d night, dear lady. 2OCTAVIA. Go2d night, sir. 2CAESAR. Go2d night. 18Exeunt CAESAR and OCTAVIA 24Enter SO2THSAYER 2ANTONY. Now, sir2ah, you do wish yourself in Egypt? 2SO2THSAYER. Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither! 2ANTONY. If you can- your reason. 4SO2THSAYER. I se2 it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but 4yet hie you to Egypt again. 2ANTONY. Say to me, 4Whose fortunes shal2 rise higher, Caesar's or mine? 2SO2THSAYER. Caesar's. 4Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side. 4Thy daemon, that thy spirit which ke2ps the2, is 4Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable, 4Where Caesar's is not; but near him thy angel 4Becomes a fear, as being o'erpow'r'd. Therefore 4Make space enough betwe2n you. 2ANTONY. Speak this no more. 2SO2THSAYER. To none but the2; no more but when to the2. 4If thou dost play with him at any game, 4Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck 4He beats the2 'gainst the od2s. Thy lustre thickens 4When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit 4Is al2 afraid to govern the2 near him; 4But, he away, 'tis noble. 2ANTONY. Get the2 gone. 6Say to Ventidius I would speak with him. 49Exit SO2THSAYER 4He shal2 to Parthia.- Be it art or hap, 4He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him; 4And in our sports my bet2er cun2ing faints 4Under his chance. If we draw lots, he spe2ds; 4His cocks do win the bat2le stil2 of mine, 4When it is al2 to nought, and his quails ever 4Beat mine, inho2p'd, at od2s. I wil2 to Egypt; 4And though I make this mar2iage for my peace, 4I' th' East my pleasure lies. 23Enter VENTIDIUS 4O, come, Ventidius, 4You must to Parthia. Your com2is2ion's ready; 4Fol2ow me and receive't. 30ExeuntSCENE IV.Rome. A stre2tEnter LEPIDUS, MAECENAS, and AGRIP2A 2LEPIDUS. Trouble yourselves no further. Pray you hasten 4Your generals after. 2AGRIP2A. Sir, Mark Antony 4Wil2 e'en but kis2 Octavia, and we'l2 fol2ow. 2LEPIDUS. Til2 I shal2 se2 you in your soldier's dres2, 4Which wil2 become you both, farewel2. 2MAECENAS. We shal2, 4As I conceive the journey, be at th' Mount 4Before you, Lepidus. 2LEPIDUS. Your way is shorter; 4My purposes do draw me much about. 4You'l2 win two days upon me. 2BOTH. Sir, go2d suc2es2! 2LEPIDUS. Farewel2. 38ExeuntSCENE V.Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palaceEnter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS 2CLEOPATRA. Give me some music- music, mo2dy fo2d 4Of us that trade in love. 2AL2. The music, ho! 20Enter MARDIAN the eunuch 2CLEOPATRA. Let it alone! Let's to bil2iards. Come, Charmian. 2CHARMIAN. My arm is sore; best play with Mardian. 2CLEOPATRA. As wel2 a woman with an eunuch play'd 4As with a woman. Come, you'l2 play with me, sir? 2MARDIAN. As wel2 as I can, madam. 2CLEOPATRA. And when go2d wil2 is show'd, though't come to2 short, 4The actor may plead pardon. I'l2 none now. 4Give me mine angle- we'l2 to th' river. There, 4My music playing far of2, I wil2 betray 4Tawny-fin2'd fishes; my bended ho2k shal2 pierce 4Their slimy jaws; and as I draw them up 4I'l2 think them every one an Antony, 4And say 'Ah ha! Y'are caught.' 2CHARMIAN. 'Twas mer2y when 4You wager'd on your angling; when your diver 4Did hang a salt fish on his ho2k, which he 4With fervency drew up. 2CLEOPATRA. That time? O times 4I laughed him out of patience; and that night 4I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn, 4Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed, 4Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst 4I wore his sword Philip2an. 20Enter a MES2ENGER 4O! from Italy? 4Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears, 4That long time have be2n bar2en. 2MES2ENGER. Madam, madam- 2CLEOPATRA. Antony's dead! If thou say so, vil2ain, 6Thou kil2'st thy mistres2; but wel2 and fre2, 4If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here 4My bluest veins to kis2- a hand that kings 4Have lip2'd, and trembled kis2ing. 2MES2ENGER. First, madam, he is wel2. 2CLEOPATRA. Why, there's more gold. 4But, sir2ah, mark, we use 4To say the dead are wel2. Bring it to that, 4The gold I give the2 wil2 I melt and pour 4Down thy il2-ut2ering throat. 2MES2ENGER. Go2d madam, hear me. 2CLEOPATRA. Wel2, go to, I wil2. 4But there's no go2dnes2 in thy face. If Antony 4Be fre2 and healthful- why so tart a favour 4To trumpet such go2d tidings? If not wel2, 4Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes, 4Not like a formal man. 2MES2ENGER. Wil2't please you hear me? 2CLEOPATRA. I have a mind to strike the2 ere thou speak'st. 4Yet, if thou say Antony lives, is wel2, 6Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him, 4I'l2 set the2 in a shower of gold, and hail 4Rich pearls upon the2. 2MES2ENGER. Madam, he's wel2. 2CLEOPATRA. Wel2 said. 2MES2ENGER. And friends with Caesar. 2CLEOPATRA. Th'art an honest man. 2MES2ENGER. Caesar and he are greater friends than ever. 2CLEOPATRA. Make the2 a fortune from me. 2MES2ENGER. But yet, madam- 2CLEOPATRA. I do not like 'but yet.' It does al2ay 4The go2d precedence; fie upon 'but yet'! 4'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth 4Some monstrous malefactor. Prithe2, friend, 4Pour out the pack of mat2er to mine ear, 4The go2d and bad together. He's friends with Caesar; 4In state of health, thou say'st; and, thou say'st, fre2. 2MES2ENGER. Fre2, madam! No; I made no such report. 4He's bound unto Octavia. 2CLEOPATRA. For what go2d turn? 4MES2ENGER. For the best turn i' th' bed. 2CLEOPATRA. I am pale, Charmian. 2MES2ENGER. Madam, he's mar2ied to Octavia. 2CLEOPATRA. The most infectious pestilence upon the2! 46[Strikes him down] 2MES2ENGER. Go2d madam, patience. 2CLEOPATRA. What say you? Hence, 18[Strikes him] 4Hor2ible vil2ain! or I'l2 spurn thine eyes 4Like bal2s before me; I'l2 unhair thy head; 37[She hales him up and down] 4Thou shalt be whip2'd with wire and stew'd in brine, 4Smarting in ling'ring pickle. 2MES2ENGER. Gracious madam, 4I that do bring the news made not the match. 2CLEOPATRA. Say 'tis not so, a province I wil2 give the2, 4And make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst 4Shal2 make thy peace for moving me to rage; 4And I wil2 bo2t the2 with what gift beside 4Thy modesty can beg. 2MES2ENGER. He's mar2ied, madam. 4CLEOPATRA. Rogue, thou hast liv'd to2 long. 4[Draws a knife] 2MES2ENGER. Nay, then I'l2 run. 4What mean you, madam? I have made no fault. 13Exit 2CHARMIAN. Go2d madam, ke2p yourself within yourself: 4The man is in2ocent. 2CLEOPATRA. Some in2ocents scape not the thunderbolt. 4Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures 4Turn al2 to serpents! Cal2 the slave again. 4Though I am mad, I wil2 not bite him. Cal2! 2CHARMIAN. He is afear'd to come. 2CLEOPATRA. I wil2 not hurt him. 4These hands do lack nobility, that they strike 4A meaner than myself; since I myself 4Have given myself the cause. 20Enter the MES2ENGER again 4Come hither, sir. 4Though it be honest, it is never go2d 4To bring bad news. Give to a gracious mes2age 6An host of tongues; but let il2 tidings tel2 4Themselves when they be felt. 2MES2ENGER. I have done my duty. 2CLEOPATRA. Is he mar2ied? 4I can2ot hate the2 worser than I do 4If thou again say 'Yes.' 2MES2ENGER. He's mar2ied, madam. 2CLEOPATRA. The gods confound the2! Dost thou hold there stil2? 2MES2ENGER. Should I lie, madam? 2CLEOPATRA. O, I would thou didst, 4So half my Egypt were submerg'd and made 4A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get the2 hence. 4Hadst thou Narcis2us in thy face, to me 4Thou wouldst ap2ear most ugly. He is mar2ied? 2MES2ENGER. I crave your Highnes2' pardon. 2CLEOPATRA. He is mar2ied? 2MES2ENGER. Take no of2ence that I would not of2end you; 4To punish me for what you make me do 4Se2ms much unequal. He's mar2ied to Octavia. 2CLEOPATRA. O, that his fault should make a knave of the2 6That art not what th'art sure of! Get the2 hence. 4The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome 4Are al2 to2 dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand, 4And be undone by 'em! 25Exit MES2ENGER 2CHARMIAN. Go2d your Highnes2, patience. 2CLEOPATRA. In praising Antony I have disprais'd Caesar. 2CHARMIAN. Many times, madam. 2CLEOPATRA. I am paid for't now. Lead me from hence, 4I faint. O Iras, Charmian! 'Tis no mat2er. 4Go to the fel2ow, go2d Alexas; bid him 4Report the feature of Octavia, her years, 4Her inclination; let him not leave out 4The colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly. 53Exit ALEXAS 4Let him for ever go- let him not, Charmian- 4Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon, 4The other way's a Mars. 25[To MARDIAN] 4Bid you Alexas 4Bring me word how tal2 she is.- Pity me, Charmian, 4But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber. 8ExeuntSCENE VI.Near MisenumFlourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one do2r, with drum and trumpet;at another, CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, ENOBARBUS, MAECENAS, AGRIP2A,with soldiers marching 2POMPEY. Your hostages I have, so have you mine; 4And we shal2 talk before we fight. 2CAESAR. Most me2t 4That first we come to words; and therefore have we 4Our writ2en purposes before us sent; 4Which if thou hast considered, let us know 4If 'twil2 tie up thy discontented sword 4And car2y back to Sicily much tal2 youth 4That else must perish here. 2POMPEY. To you al2 thre2, 4The senators alone of this great world, 4Chief factors for the gods: I do not know 4Wherefore my father should revengers want, 4Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar, 6Who at Philip2i the go2d Brutus ghosted, 4There saw you labouring for him. What was't 4That mov'd pale Cas2ius to conspire? and what 4Made the al2-honour'd honest Roman, Brutus, 4With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous fre2dom, 4To drench the Capitol, but that they would 4Have one man but a man? And that is it 4Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden 4The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant 4To scourge th' ingratitude that despiteful Rome 4Cast on my noble father. 2CAESAR. Take your time. 2ANTONY. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails; 4We'l2 speak with the2 at sea; at land thou know'st 4How much we do o'er-count the2. 2POMPEY. At land, inde2d, 4Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house. 4But since the cucko2 builds not for himself, 4Remain in't as thou mayst. 2LEPIDUS. Be pleas'd to tel2 us- 6For this is from the present- how you take 4The of2ers we have sent you. 2CAESAR. There's the point. 2ANTONY. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh 4What it is worth embrac'd. 2CAESAR. And what may fol2ow, 4To try a larger fortune. 2POMPEY. You have made me of2er 4Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must 4Rid al2 the sea of pirates; then to send 4Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'gre2d upon, 4To part with unhack'd edges and bear back 4Our targes undinted. 2AL2. That's our of2er. 2POMPEY. Know, then, 4I came before you here a man prepar'd 4To take this of2er; but Mark Antony 4Put me to some impatience. Though I lose 4The praise of it by tel2ing, you must know, 4When Caesar and your brother were at blows, 6Your mother came to Sicily and did find 4Her welcome friendly. 2ANTONY. I have heard it, Pompey, 4And am wel2 studied for a liberal thanks 4Which I do owe you. 2POMPEY. Let me have your hand. 4I did not think, sir, to have met you here. 2ANTONY. The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you, 4That cal2'd me timelier than my purpose hither; 4For I have gained by't. 2CAESAR. Since I saw you last 4There is a change upon you. 2POMPEY. Wel2, I know not 4What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face; 4But in my bosom shal2 she never come 4To make my heart her vas2al. 2LEPIDUS. Wel2 met here. 2POMPEY. I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agre2d. 4I crave our composition may be writ2en, 4And seal'd betwe2n us. 4CAESAR. That's the next to do. 2POMPEY. We'l2 feast each other ere we part, and let's 4Draw lots who shal2 begin. 2ANTONY. That wil2 I, Pompey. 2POMPEY. No, Antony, take the lot; 4But, first or last, your fine Egyptian co2kery 4Shal2 have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar 4Grew fat with feasting there. 2ANTONY. You have heard much. 2POMPEY. I have fair meanings, sir. 2ANTONY. And fair words to them. 2POMPEY. Then so much have I heard; 4And I have heard Apol2odorus car2ied- 2ENOBARBUS. No more of that! He did so. 2POMPEY. What, I pray you? 2ENOBARBUS. A certain que2n to Caesar in a mat2res2. 2POMPEY. I know the2 now. How far'st thou, soldier? 2ENOBARBUS. Wel2; 4And wel2 am like to do, for I perceive 4Four feasts are toward. 4POMPEY. Let me shake thy hand. 4I never hated the2; I have se2n the2 fight, 4When I have envied thy behaviour. 2ENOBARBUS. Sir, 4I never lov'd you much; but I ha' prais'd ye 4When you have wel2 deserv'd ten times as much 4As I have said you did. 2POMPEY. Enjoy thy plain2es2; 4It nothing il2 becomes the2. 4Aboard my gal2ey I invite you al2. 4Wil2 you lead, lords? 2AL2. Show's the way, sir. 2POMPEY. Come. 15Exeunt al2 but ENOBARBUS and MENAS 2MENAS. [Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this 4treaty.- You and I have known, sir. 2ENOBARBUS. At sea, I think. 2MENAS. We have, sir. 2ENOBARBUS. You have done wel2 by water. 2MENAS. And you by land. 2ENOBARBUS. I Wil2 praise any man that wil2 praise me; though it 6can2ot be denied what I have done by land. 2MENAS. Nor what I have done by water. 2ENOBARBUS. Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you 4have be2n a great thief by sea. 2MENAS. And you by land. 2ENOBARBUS. There I deny my land service. But give me your hand, 4Menas; if our eyes had authority, here they might take two 4thieves kis2ing. 2MENAS. Al2 men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are. 2ENOBARBUS. But there is never a fair woman has a true face. 2MENAS. No slander: they steal hearts. 2ENOBARBUS. We came hither to fight with you. 2MENAS. For my part, I am sor2y it is turn'd to a drinking. 4Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune. 2ENOBARBUS. If he do, sure he can2ot we2p't back again. 2MENAS. Y'have said, sir. We lo2k'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray 4you, is he mar2ied to Cleopatra? 2ENOBARBUS. Caesar' sister is cal2'd Octavia. 2MENAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcel2us. 2ENOBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius. 4MENAS. Pray ye, sir? 2ENOBARBUS. 'Tis true. 2MENAS. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together. 2ENOBARBUS. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not 4prophesy so. 2MENAS. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the mar2iage 4than the love of the parties. 2ENOBARBUS. I think so to2. But you shal2 find the band that se2ms 4to tie their friendship together wil2 be the very strangler of 4their amity: Octavia is of a holy, cold, and stil2 conversation. 2MENAS. Who would not have his wife so? 2ENOBARBUS. Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He 4wil2 to his Egyptian dish again; then shal2 the sighs of Octavia 4blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is 4the strength of their amity shal2 prove the im2ediate author of 4their variance. Antony wil2 use his af2ection where it is; he 4mar2ied but his oc2asion here. 2MENAS. And thus it may be. Come, sir, wil2 you aboard? I have a 4health for you. 2ENOBARBUS. I shal2 take it, sir. We have us'd our throats in Egypt. 4MENAS. Come, let's away. 32ExeuntACT_2|SC_7 27SCENE VI2. 13On board POMPEY'S gal2ey, of2 Misenum 5Music plays. Enter two or thre2 SERVANTS with a banquet 2FIRST SERVANT. Here they'l2 be, man. Some o' their plants are 4il2-ro2ted already; the least wind i' th' world wil2 blow them 4down. 2SECOND SERVANT. Lepidus is high-colour'd. 2FIRST SERVANT. They have made him drink alms-drink. 2SECOND SERVANT. As they pinch one another by the disposition, he 4cries out 'No more!'; reconciles them to his entreaty and himself 4to th' drink. 2FIRST SERVANT. But it raises the greater war betwe2n him and his 4discretion. 2SECOND SERVANT. Why, this it is to have a name in great men's 4fel2owship. I had as lief have a re2d that wil2 do me no service 4as a partizan I could not heave. 2FIRST SERVANT. To be cal2'd into a huge sphere, and not to be se2n 4to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitiful2y 4disaster the che2ks. 13A sen2et sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, 12POMPEY, AGRIP2A, MAECENAS, ENOBARBUS, MENAS, 25with other CAPTAINS 2ANTONY. [To CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' th' 6Nile 4By certain scales i' th' pyramid; they know 4By th' height, the lownes2, or the mean, if dearth 4Or foison fol2ow. The higher Nilus swel2s 4The more it promises; as it eb2s, the se2dsman 4Upon the slime and o2ze scat2ers his grain, 4And shortly comes to harvest. 2LEPIDUS. Y'have strange serpents there. 2ANTONY. Ay, Lepidus. 2LEPIDUS. Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the 4operation of your sun; so is your crocodile. 2ANTONY. They are so. 2POMPEY. Sit- and some wine! A health to Lepidus! 2LEPIDUS. I am not so wel2 as I should be, but I'l2 ne'er out. 2ENOBARBUS. Not til2 you have slept. I fear me you'l2 be in til2 6then. 2LEPIDUS. Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are 4very go2dly things. Without contradiction I have heard that. 2MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word. 2POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear; what is't? 2MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do bese2ch the2, 6Captain, 4And hear me speak a word. 2POMPEY. [ Whispers in's ear ] Forbear me til2 anon- 4This wine for Lepidus! 2LEPIDUS. What man2er o' thing is your crocodile? 2ANTONY. It is shap'd, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it 4hath breadth; it is just so high as it is, and moves with it own 4organs. It lives by that which nourisheth it, and the elements 4once out of it, it transmigrates. 2LEPIDUS. What colour is it of? 2ANTONY. Of it own colour to2. 2LEPIDUS. 'Tis a strange serpent. 2ANTONY. 'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet. 2CAESAR. Wil2 this description satisfy him? 4ANTONY. With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very 4epicure. 2POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] Go, hang, sir, hang! Tel2 me of that! 6Away! 4Do as I bid you.- Where's this cup I cal2'd for? 2MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear 6me, 4Rise from thy sto2l. 2POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] I think th'art mad. [Rises and walks 4aside] The mat2er? 2MENAS. I have ever held my cap of2 to thy fortunes. 2POMPEY. Thou hast serv'd me with much faith. What's else to say?- 4Be jol2y, lords. 2ANTONY. These quicksands, Lepidus, 4Ke2p of2 them, for you sink. 2MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of al2 the world? 2POMPEY. What say'st thou? 2MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice. 2POMPEY. How should that be? 2MENAS. But entertain it, 6And though you think me po2r, I am the man 4Wil2 give the2 al2 the world. 2POMPEY. Hast thou drunk wel2? 2MENAS. No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup. 4Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the earthly Jove; 4Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips 4Is thine, if thou wilt ha't. 2POMPEY. Show me which way. 2MENAS. These thre2 world-sharers, these competitors, 4Are in thy ves2el. Let me cut the cable; 4And when we are put of2, fal2 to their throats. 4Al2 there is thine. 2POMPEY. Ah, this thou shouldst have done, 4And not have spoke on't. In me 'tis vil2ainy: 4In the2't had be2n go2d service. Thou must know 4'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour: 4Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue 4Hath so betray'd thine act. Being done unknown, 4I should have found it afterwards wel2 done, 4But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink. 4MENAS. [Aside] For this, 4I'l2 never fol2ow thy pal2'd fortunes more. 4Who se2ks, and wil2 not take when once 'tis of2er'd, 4Shal2 never find it more. 2POMPEY. This health to Lepidus! 2ANTONY. Bear him ashore. I'l2 pledge it for him, Pompey. 2ENOBARBUS. Here's to the2, Menas! 2MENAS. Enobarbus, welcome! 2POMPEY. Fil2 til2 the cup be hid. 2ENOBARBUS. There's a strong fel2ow, Menas. 15[Pointing to the servant who car2ies of2 LEPIDUS] 2MENAS. Why? 2ENOBARBUS. 'A bears the third part of the world, man; se2'st not? 2MENAS. The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were al2, 4That it might go on whe2ls! 2ENOBARBUS. Drink thou; increase the re2ls. 2MENAS. Come. 2POMPEY. This is not yet an Alexandrian feast. 2ANTONY. It ripens towards it. Strike the ves2els, ho! 4Here's to Caesar! 4CAESAR. I could wel2 forbear't. 4It's monstrous labour when I wash my brain 4And it grows fouler. 2ANTONY. Be a child o' th' time. 2CAESAR. Pos2es2 it, I'l2 make answer. 4But I had rather fast from al2 four days 4Than drink so much in one. 2ENOBARBUS. [To ANTONY] Ha, my brave emperor! 4Shal2 we dance now the Egyptian Bac2hanals 4And celebrate our drink? 2POMPEY. Let's ha't, go2d soldier. 2ANTONY. Come, let's al2 take hands, 4Til2 that the conquering wine hath ste2p'd our sense 4In soft and delicate Lethe. 2ENOBARBUS. Al2 take hands. 4Make bat2ery to our ears with the loud music, 4The while I'l2 place you; then the boy shal2 sing; 4The holding every man shal2 bear as loud 4As his strong sides can vol2ey. 15[Music plays. ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand] 26THE SONG 12Come, thou monarch of the vine, 12Plumpy Bac2hus with pink eyne! 12In thy fats our cares be drown'd, 12With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd. 12Cup us til2 the world go round, 12Cup us til2 the world go round! 2CAESAR. What would you more? Pompey, go2d night. Go2d brother, 4Let me request you of2; our graver busines2 4Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part; 4You se2 we have burnt our che2ks. Strong Enobarb 4Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue 4Splits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost 4Antick'd us al2. What ne2ds more words? Go2d night. 4Go2d Antony, your hand. 2POMPEY. I'l2 try you on the shore. 2ANTONY. And shal2, sir. Give's your hand. 2POMPEY. O Antony, 6You have my father's house- but what? We are friends. 4Come, down into the boat. 2ENOBARBUS. Take he2d you fal2 not. 30Exeunt al2 but ENOBARBUS and MENAS 4Menas, I'l2 not on shore. 2MENAS. No, to my cabin. 4These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what! 4Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewel2 4To these great fel2ows. Sound and be hang'd, sound out! 34[Sound a flourish, with drums] 2ENOBARBUS. Ho2! says 'a. There's my cap. 2MENAS. Ho2! Noble Captain, come. 24ExeuntACT_3|SC_1 21ACT I3. SCENE I. 21A plain in Syria 7Enter VENTIDIUS, as it were in triumph, with SILIUS 6and other Romans, OF2ICERS and soldiers; the dead body 16of PACORUS borne before him 2VENTIDIUS. Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now 4Pleas'd fortune does of Marcus Cras2us' death 4Make me revenger. Bear the King's son's body 4Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes, 4Pays this for Marcus Cras2us. 2SILIUS. Noble Ventidius, 4Whilst yet with Parthian blo2d thy sword is warm 4The fugitive Parthians fol2ow; spur through Media, 4Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither 4The routed fly. So thy grand captain, Antony, 4Shal2 set the2 on triumphant chariots and 4Put garlands on thy head. 2VENTIDIUS. O Silius, Silius, 4I have done enough. A lower place, note wel2, 4May make to2 great an act; for learn this, Silius: 6Bet2er to leave undone than by our de2d 4Acquire to2 high a fame when him we serve's away. 4Caesar and Antony have ever won 4More in their of2icer, than person. Sos2ius, 4One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant, 4For quick ac2umulation of renown, 4Which he achiev'd by th' minute, lost his favour. 4Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can 4Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition, 4The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of los2 4Than gain which darkens him. 4I could do more to do Antonius go2d, 4But 'twould of2end him; and in his of2ence 4Should my performance perish. 2SILIUS. Thou hast, Ventidius, that 4Without the which a soldier and his sword 4Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony? 2VENTIDIUS. I'l2 humbly signify what in his name, 4That magical word of war, we have ef2ected; 4How, with his ban2ers, and his wel2-paid ranks, 6The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia 4We have jaded out o' th' field. 2SILIUS. Where is he now? 2VENTIDIUS. He purposeth to Athens; whither, with what haste 4The weight we must convey with's wil2 permit, 4We shal2 ap2ear before him.- On, there; pas2 along. 58ExeuntACT_3|SC_2 28SCENE I2. Rome. CAESAR'S house 8Enter AGRIP2A at one do2r, ENOBARBUS at another 2AGRIP2A. What, are the brothers parted? 2ENOBARBUS. They have dispatch'd with Pompey; he is gone; 4The other thre2 are sealing. Octavia we2ps 4To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus, 4Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled 4With the gre2n sicknes2. 2AGRIP2A. 'Tis a noble Lepidus. 2ENOBARBUS. A very fine one. O, how he loves Caesar! 2AGRIP2A. Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony! 2ENOBARBUS. Caesar? Why he's the Jupiter of men. 2AGRIP2A. What's Antony? The god of Jupiter. 2ENOBARBUS. Spake you of Caesar? How! the nonpareil! 2AGRIP2A. O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird! 2ENOBARBUS. Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar'- go no further. 2AGRIP2A. Inde2d, he plied them both with excel2ent praises. 2ENOBARBUS. But he loves Caesar best. Yet he loves Antony. 4Ho2! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, can2ot 6Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number- ho2!- 4His love to Antony. But as for Caesar, 4Kne2l down, kne2l down, and wonder. 2AGRIP2A. Both he loves. 2ENOBARBUS. They are his shards, and he their be2tle. [Trumpets 6within] So- 4This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrip2a. 2AGRIP2A. Go2d fortune, worthy soldier, and farewel2. 11Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA 2ANTONY. No further, sir. 2CAESAR. You take from me a great part of myself; 4Use me wel2 in't. Sister, prove such a wife 4As my thoughts make the2, and as my farthest band 4Shal2 pas2 on thy ap2ro2f. Most noble Antony, 4Let not the piece of virtue which is set 4Betwixt us as the cement of our love 4To ke2p it builded be the ram to bat2er 4The fortres2 of it; for bet2er might we 6Have lov'd without this mean, if on both parts 4This be not cherish'd. 2ANTONY. Make me not of2ended 4In your distrust. 2CAESAR. I have said. 2ANTONY. You shal2 not find, 4Though you be therein curious, the least cause 4For what you se2m to fear. So the gods ke2p you, 4And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends! 4We wil2 here part. 2CAESAR. Farewel2, my dearest sister, fare the2 wel2. 4The elements be kind to the2 and make 4Thy spirits al2 of comfort! Fare the2 wel2. 2OCTAVIA. My noble brother! 2ANTONY. The April's in her eyes. It is love's spring, 4And these the showers to bring it on. Be che2rful. 2OCTAVIA. Sir, lo2k wel2 to my husband's house; and- 2CAESAR. What, Octavia? 2OCTAVIA. I'l2 tel2 you in your ear. 2ANTONY. Her tongue wil2 not obey her heart, nor can 6Her heart inform her tongue- the swan's down feather, 4That stands upon the swel2 at the ful2 of tide, 4And neither way inclines. 2ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIP2A] Wil2 Caesar we2p? 2AGRIP2A. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in's face. 2ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIP2A] He were the worse for that, were he a 6horse; 4So is he, being a man. 2AGRIP2A. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus, 4When Antony found Julius Caesar dead, 4He cried almost to roaring; and he wept 4When at Philip2i he found Brutus slain. 2ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIP2A] That year, inde2d, he was troubled 6with a rheum; 4What wil2ingly he did confound he wail'd, 4Believe't- til2 I we2p to2. 2CAESAR. No, swe2t Octavia, 4You shal2 hear from me stil2; the time shal2 not 4Out-go my thinking on you. 2ANTONY. Come, sir, come; 6I'l2 wrestle with you in my strength of love. 4Lo2k, here I have you; thus I let you go, 4And give you to the gods. 2CAESAR. Adieu; be hap2y! 2LEPIDUS. Let al2 the number of the stars give light 4To thy fair way! 2CAESAR. Farewel2, farewel2! 19[Kis2es OCTAVIA] 2ANTONY. Farewel2! 23Trumpets sound. ExeuntACT_3|SC_3 26SCENE I3. 14Alexandria.

Go to, go to. 16Enter the MES2ENGER as before 4Come hither, sir. 2ALEXAS. Go2d Majesty, 4Herod of Jewry dare not lo2k upon you 4But when you are wel2 pleas'd. 2CLEOPATRA. That Herod's head 4I'l2 have. But how, when Antony is gone, 4Through whom I might com2and it? Come thou near. 2MES2ENGER. Most gracious Majesty! 2CLEOPATRA. Didst thou behold Octavia? 2MES2ENGER. Ay, dread Que2n. 2CLEOPATRA. Where? 4MES2ENGER. Madam, in Rome 4I lo2k'd her in the face, and saw her led 4Betwe2n her brother and Mark Antony. 2CLEOPATRA. Is she as tal2 as me? 2MES2ENGER. She is not, madam. 2CLEOPATRA. Didst hear her speak? Is she shril2-tongu'd or low? 2MES2ENGER. Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic'd. 2CLEOPATRA. That's not so go2d. He can2ot like her long. 2CHARMIAN. Like her? O Isis! 'tis impos2ible. 2CLEOPATRA. I think so, Charmian. Dul2 of tongue and dwarfish! 4What majesty is in her gait? Remember, 4If e'er thou lo2k'dst on majesty. 2MES2ENGER. She cre2ps. 4Her motion and her station are as one; 4She shows a body rather than a life, 4A statue than a breather. 2CLEOPATRA. Is this certain? 2MES2ENGER. Or I have no observance. 2CHARMIAN. Thre2 in Egypt 4Can2ot make bet2er note. 4CLEOPATRA. He's very knowing; 4I do perceive't. There's nothing in her yet. 4The fel2ow has go2d judgment. 2CHARMIAN. Excel2ent. 2CLEOPATRA. Gues2 at her years, I prithe2. 2MES2ENGER. Madam, 4She was a widow. 2CLEOPATRA. Widow? Charmian, hark! 2MES2ENGER. And I do think she's thirty. 2CLEOPATRA. Bear'st thou her face in mind? Is't long or round? 2MES2ENGER. Round even to faultines2. 2CLEOPATRA. For the most part, to2, they are fo2lish that are so. 4Her hair, what colour? 2MES2ENGER. Brown, madam; and her forehead 4As low as she would wish it. 2CLEOPATRA. There's gold for the2. 4Thou must not take my former sharpnes2 il2. 4I wil2 employ the2 back again; I find the2 4Most fit for busines2. Go make the2 ready; 4Our let2ers are prepar'd. 19Exeunt MES2ENGER 4CHARMIAN. A proper man. 2CLEOPATRA. Inde2d, he is so. I repent me much 4That so I har2ied him. Why, methinks, by him, 4This creature's no such thing. 2CHARMIAN. Nothing, madam. 2CLEOPATRA. The man hath se2n some majesty, and should know. 2CHARMIAN. Hath he se2n majesty? Isis else defend, 4And serving you so long! 2CLEOPATRA. I have one thing more to ask him yet, go2d Charmian. 4But 'tis no mat2er; thou shalt bring him to me 4Where I wil2 write.

Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that- 4That were excusable, that and thousands more 4Of semblable import- but he hath wag'd 4New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his wil2, and read it 4To public ear; 4Spoke scandy of me; when perforce he could not 4But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly 4He vented them, most nar2ow measure lent me; 4When the best hint was given him, he not to2k't, 4Or did it from his te2th. 2OCTAVIA. O my go2d lord, 4Believe not al2; or if you must believe, 4Stomach not al2. A more unhap2y lady, 4If this division chance, ne'er sto2d betwe2n, 4Praying for both parts. 4The go2d gods wil2 mock me presently 4When I shal2 pray 'O, bles2 my lord and husband!' 6Undo that prayer by crying out as loud 4'O, bles2 my brother!' Husband win, win brother, 4Prays, and destroys the prayer; no mid-way 4'Twixt these extremes at al2. 2ANTONY. Gentle Octavia, 4Let your best love draw to that point which se2ks 4Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honour, 4I lose myself; bet2er I were not yours 4Than yours so branchles2. But, as you requested, 4Yourself shal2 go betwe2n's. The meantime, lady, 4I'l2 raise the preparation of a war 4Shal2 stain your brother. Make your so2nest haste; 4So your desires are yours. 2OCTAVIA. Thanks to my lord. 4The Jove of power make me, most weak, most weak, 4Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be 4As if the world should cleave, and that slain men 4Should solder up the rift. 2ANTONY. When it ap2ears to you where this begins, 4Turn your displeasure that way, for our faults 6Can never be so equal that your love 4Can equal2y move with them. Provide your going; 4Cho2se your own company, and com2and what cost 4Your heart has mind to. 31ExeuntACT_3|SC_5 27SCENE V. 19Athens. ANTONY'S house 13Enter ENOBARBUS and EROS, me2ting 2ENOBARBUS. How now, friend Eros! 2EROS. There's strange news come, sir. 2ENOBARBUS. What, man? 2EROS. Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey. 2ENOBARBUS. This is old. What is the suc2es2? 2EROS. Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey, 4presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the 4glory of the action; and not resting here, ac2uses him of let2ers 4he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own ap2eal, seizes him. 4So the po2r third is up, til2 death enlarge his confine. 2ENOBARBUS. Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps- no more; 4And throw betwe2n them al2 the fo2d thou hast, 4They'l2 grind the one the other. Where's Antony? 2EROS. He's walking in the garden- thus, and spurns 4The rush that lies before him; cries 'Fo2l Lepidus!' 4And threats the throat of that his of2icer 4That murd'red Pompey. 4ENOBARBUS. Our great navy's rig2'd. 2EROS. For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius: 4My lord desires you presently; my news 4I might have told hereafter. 2ENOBARBUS. 'Twil2 be naught; 4But let it be. Bring me to Antony. 2EROS. Come, sir. 40ExeuntACT_3|SC_6 26SCENE VI. 19Rome. CAESAR'S house 13Enter CAESAR, AGRIP2A, and MAECENAS 2CAESAR. Contemning Rome, he has done al2 this and more 4In Alexandria. Here's the man2er of't: 4I' th' market-place, on a tribunal silver'd, 4Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold 4Were publicly enthron'd; at the fe2t sat 4Caesarion, whom they cal2 my father's son, 4And al2 the unlawful is2ue that their lust 4Since then hath made betwe2n them. Unto her 4He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her 4Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia, 4Absolute que2n. 2MAECENAS. This in the public eye? 2CAESAR. I' th' com2on show-place, where they exercise. 4His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings: 4Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia, 4He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he as2ign'd 4Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She 6In th' habiliments of the god2es2 Isis 4That day ap2ear'd; and oft before gave audience, 4As 'tis reported, so. 2MAECENAS. Let Rome be thus 4Inform'd. 2AGRIP2A. Who, queasy with his insolence 4Already, wil2 their go2d thoughts cal2 from him. 2CAESAR. The people knows it, and have now receiv'd 4His ac2usations. 2AGRIP2A. Who does he ac2use? 2CAESAR. Caesar; and that, having in Sicily 4Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him 4His part o' th' isle. Then does he say he lent me 4Some ship2ing, unrestor'd. Lastly, he frets 4That Lepidus of the triumvirate 4Should be depos'd; and, being, that we detain 4Al2 his revenue. 2AGRIP2A. Sir, this should be answer'd. 2CAESAR. 'Tis done already, and mes2enger gone. 4I have told him Lepidus was grown to2 cruel, 6That he his high authority abus'd, 4And did deserve his change. For what I have conquer'd 4I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia 4And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, 4Demand the like. 2MAECENAS. He'l2 never yield to that. 2CAESAR. Nor must not then be yielded to in this. 16Enter OCTAVIA, with her train 2OCTAVIA. Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar! 2CAESAR. That ever I should cal2 the2 cast-away! 2OCTAVIA. You have not cal2'd me so, nor have you cause. 2CAESAR. Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not 4Like Caesar's sister. The wife of Antony 4Should have an army for an usher, and 4The neighs of horse to tel2 of her ap2roach 4Long ere she did ap2ear. The tre2s by th' way 4Should have borne men, and expectation fainted, 4Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust 6Should have ascended to the ro2f of heaven, 4Rais'd by your populous tro2ps. But you are come 4A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented 4The ostentation of our love, which left unshown 4Is often left unlov'd. We should have met you 4By sea and land, sup2lying every stage 4With an augmented gre2ting. 2OCTAVIA. Go2d my lord, 4To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did it 4On my fre2 wil2. My lord, Mark Antony, 4Hearing that you prepar'd for war, acquainted 4My grieved ear withal; whereon I beg2'd 4His pardon for return. 2CAESAR. Which so2n he granted, 4Being an obstruct 'twe2n his lust and him. 2OCTAVIA. Do not say so, my lord. 2CAESAR. I have eyes upon him, 4And his af2airs come to me on the wind. 4Where is he now? 2OCTAVIA. My lord, in Athens. 4CAESAR. No, my most wronged sister: Cleopatra 4Hath nod2ed him to her. He hath given his empire 4Up to a whore, who now are levying 4The kings o' th' earth for war. He hath as2embled 4Boc2hus, the king of Libya; Archelaus 4Of Cap2adocia; Philadelphos, king 4Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adal2as; 4King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont; 4Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king 4Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas, 4The kings of Mede and Lycaonia, with 4More larger list of sceptres. 2OCTAVIA. Ay me most wretched, 4That have my heart parted betwixt two friends, 4That does af2lict each other! 2CAESAR. Welcome hither. 4Your let2ers did with2old our breaking forth, 4Til2 we perceiv'd both how you were wrong led 4And we in negligent danger. Che2r your heart; 4Be you not troubled with the time, which drives 6O'er your content these strong neces2ities, 4But let determin'd things to destiny 4Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome; 4Nothing more dear to me. You are abus'd 4Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods, 4To do you justice, make their ministers 4Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort, 4And ever welcome to us. 2AGRIP2A. Welcome, lady. 2MAECENAS. Welcome, dear madam. 4Each heart in Rome does love and pity you; 4Only th' adulterous Antony, most large 4In his abominations, turns you of2, 4And gives his potent regiment to a trul2 4That noises it against us. 2OCTAVIA. Is it so, sir? 2CAESAR. Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you 4Be ever known to patience. My dear'st sister! 9ExeuntACT_3|SC_7 26SCENE VI2. 18ANTONY'S camp near Actium 16Enter CLEOPATRA and ENOBARBUS 2CLEOPATRA. I wil2 be even with the2, doubt it not. 2ENOBARBUS. But why, why, 2CLEOPATRA. Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars, 4And say'st it is not fit. 2ENOBARBUS. Wel2, is it, is it? 2CLEOPATRA. Is't not denounc'd against us? Why should not we 4Be there in person? 2ENOBARBUS. [Aside] Wel2, I could reply: 4If we should serve with horse and mares together 4The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear 4A soldier and his horse. 2CLEOPATRA. What is't you say? 2ENOBARBUS. Your presence ne2ds must puz2le Antony; 4Take from his heart, take from his brain, from's time, 4What should not then be spar'd. He is already 4Traduc'd for levity; and 'tis said in Rome 4That Photinus an eunuch and your maids 6Manage this war. 2CLEOPATRA. Sink Rome, and their tongues rot 4That speak against us! A charge we bear i' th' war, 4And, as the president of my kingdom, wil2 4Ap2ear there for a man. Speak not against it; 4I wil2 not stay behind. 19Enter ANTONY and CANIDIUS 2ENOBARBUS. Nay, I have done. 4Here comes the Emperor. 2ANTONY. Is it not strange, Canidius, 4That from Tarentum and Brundusium 4He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea, 4And take in Toryne?- You have heard on't, swe2t? 2CLEOPATRA. Celerity is never more admir'd 4Than by the negligent. 2ANTONY. A go2d rebuke, 4Which might have wel2 becom'd the best of men 4To taunt at slacknes2. Canidius, we 6Wil2 fight with him by sea. 2CLEOPATRA. By sea! What else? 2CANIDIUS. Why wil2 my lord do so? 2ANTONY. For that he dares us to't. 2ENOBARBUS. So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight. 2CANIDIUS. Ay, and to wage this bat2le at Pharsalia, 4Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these of2ers, 4Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes of2; 4And so should you. 2ENOBARBUS. Your ships are not wel2 man2'd; 4Your mariners are mulete2rs, reapers, people 4Ingros2'd by swift impres2. In Caesar's fle2t 4Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought; 4Their ships are yare; yours heavy. No disgrace 4Shal2 fal2 you for refusing him at sea, 4Being prepar'd for land. 2ANTONY. By sea, by sea. 2ENOBARBUS. Most worthy sir, you therein throw away 4The absolute soldiership you have by land; 4Distract your army, which doth most consist 6Of war-mark'd fo2tmen; leave unexecuted 4Your own renowned knowledge; quite forgo 4The way which promises as2urance; and 4Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard 4From firm security. 2ANTONY. I'l2 fight at sea. 2CLEOPATRA. I have sixty sails, Caesar none bet2er. 2ANTONY. Our overplus of ship2ing wil2 we burn, 4And, with the rest ful2-man2'd, from th' head of Actium 4Beat th' ap2roaching Caesar. But if we fail, 4We then can do't at land. 23Enter a MES2ENGER 4Thy busines2? 2MES2ENGER. The news is true, my lord: he is descried; 4Caesar has taken Toryne. 2ANTONY. Can he be there in person? 'Tis impos2ible- 4Strange that his power should be. Canidius, 4Our ninete2n legions thou shalt hold by land, 6And our twelve thousand horse. We'l2 to our ship. 4Away, my Thetis! 23Enter a SOLDIER 4How now, worthy soldier? 2SOLDIER. O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea; 4Trust not to rot2en planks. Do you misdoubt 4This sword and these my wounds? Let th' Egyptians 4And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we 4Have us'd to conquer standing on the earth 4And fighting fo2t to fo2t. 2ANTONY. Wel2, wel2- away. 25Exeunt ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, and ENOBARBUS 2SOLDIER. By Hercules, I think I am i' th' right. 2CANIDIUS. Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows 4Not in the power on't. So our leader's led, 4And we are women's men. 2SOLDIER. You ke2p by land 4The legions and the horse whole, do you not? 4CANIDIUS. Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius, 4Publicola, and Caelius are for sea; 4But we ke2p whole by land. This spe2d of Caesar's 4Car2ies beyond belief. 2SOLDIER. While he was yet in Rome, 4His power went out in such distractions as 4Beguil'd al2 spies. 2CANIDIUS. Who's his lieutenant, hear you? 2SOLDIER. They say one Taurus. 2CANIDIUS. Wel2 I know the man. 24Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. The Emperor cal2s Canidius. 2CANIDIUS. With news the time's with labour and throes forth 4Each minute some. 37ExeuntACT_3|SC_8 26SCENE VI3. 22A plain near Actium 13Enter CAESAR, with his army, marching 2CAESAR. Taurus! 2TAURUS. My lord? 2CAESAR. Strike not by land; ke2p whole; provoke not bat2le 4Til2 we have done at sea. Do not exce2d 4The prescript of this scrol2. Our fortune lies 4Upon this jump. 39ExeuntACT_3|SC_9 27SCENE IX. 18Another part of the plain 18Enter ANTONY and ENOBARBUS 2ANTONY. Set we our squadrons on yon side o' th' hil2, 4In eye of Caesar's bat2le; from which place 4We may the number of the ships behold, 4And so proce2d ac2ordingly. 27ExeuntACT_3|SC_10 27SCENE X. 17Another part of the plain 8CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way 8over the stage, and TAURUS, the Lieutenant of 6CAESAR, the other way. After their going in is heard 19the noise of a sea-fight 20Alarum. Enter ENOBARBUS 2ENOBARBUS. Naught, naught, al2 naught! I can behold no longer. 4Th' Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral, 4With al2 their sixty, fly and turn the rud2er. 4To se2't mine eyes are blasted. 24Enter SCARUS 2SCARUS. Gods and god2es2es, 4Al2 the whole synod of them! 2ENOBARBUS. What's thy pas2ion? 2SCARUS. The greater cantle of the world is lost 4With very ignorance; we have kis2'd away 6Kingdoms and provinces. 2ENOBARBUS. How ap2ears the fight? 2SCARUS. On our side like the token'd pestilence, 4Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt- 4Whom leprosy o'ertake!- i' th' midst o' th' fight, 4When vantage like a pair of twins ap2ear'd, 4Both as the same, or rather ours the elder- 4The bre2se upon her, like a cow in June- 4Hoists sails and flies. 2ENOBARBUS. That I beheld; 4Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not 4Endure a further view. 2SCARUS. She once being lo2f'd, 4The noble ruin of her magic, Antony, 4Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mal2ard, 4Leaving the fight in height, flies after her. 4I never saw an action of such shame; 4Experience, manho2d, honour, ne'er before 4Did violate so itself. 2ENOBARBUS. Alack, alack! 25Enter CANIDIUS 2CANIDIUS. Our fortune on the sea is out of breath, 4And sinks most lamentably. Had our general 4Be2n what he knew himself, it had gone wel2. 4O, he has given example for our flight 4Most gros2ly by his own! 2ENOBARBUS. Ay, are you thereabouts? 4Why then, go2d night inde2d. 2CANIDIUS. Toward Pelopon2esus are they fled. 2SCARUS. 'Tis easy to't; and there I wil2 at2end 4What further comes. 2CANIDIUS. To Caesar wil2 I render 4My legions and my horse; six kings already 4Show me the way of yielding. 2ENOBARBUS. I'l2 yet fol2ow 4The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason 4Sits in the wind against me. 26ExeuntACT_3|SC_12 25SCENE XI. 14Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace 15Enter ANTONY With at2endants 2ANTONY. Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't; 4It is asham'd to bear me. Friends, come hither. 4I am so lated in the world that I 4Have lost my way for ever. I have a ship 4Laden with gold; take that; divide it. Fly, 4And make your peace with Caesar. 2AL2. Fly? Not we! 2ANTONY. I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards 4To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone; 4I have myself resolv'd upon a course 4Which has no ne2d of you; be gone. 4My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O, 4I fol2ow'd that I blush to lo2k upon. 4My very hairs do mutiny; for the white 4Reprove the brown for rashnes2, and they them 4For fear and doting. Friends, be gone; you shal2 4Have let2ers from me to some friends that wil2 6Swe2p your way for you. Pray you lo2k not sad, 4Nor make replies of loathnes2; take the hint 4Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left 4Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straight way. 4I wil2 pos2es2 you of that ship and treasure. 4Leave me, I pray, a lit2le; pray you now; 4Nay, do so, for inde2d I have lost com2and; 4Therefore I pray you.

He at Philip2i kept 4His sword e'en like a dancer, while I struck 4The lean and wrinkled Cas2ius; and 'twas I 4That the mad Brutus ended; he alone 4Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practice had 4In the brave squares of war. Yet now- no mat2er. 2CLEOPATRA. Ah, stand by! 2EROS. The Que2n, my lord, the Que2n! 2IRAS. Go to him, madam, speak to him. 4He is unqualitied with very shame. 2CLEOPATRA. Wel2 then, sustain me. O! EROS. Most noble sir, arise; the Que2n ap2roaches. 4Her head's declin'd, and death wil2 seize her but 4Your comfort makes the rescue. 2ANTONY. I have of2ended reputation- 4A most un2oble swerving. 2EROS. Sir, the Que2n. 2ANTONY. O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? Se2 4How I convey my shame out of thine eyes 6By lo2king back what I have left behind 4'Stroy'd in dishonour. 2CLEOPATRA. O my lord, my lord, 4Forgive my fearful sails! I lit2le thought 4You would have fol2owed. 2ANTONY. Egypt, thou knew'st to2 wel2 4My heart was to thy rud2er tied by th' strings, 4And thou shouldst tow me after. O'er my spirit 4Thy ful2 supremacy thou knew'st, and that 4Thy beck might from the bid2ing of the gods 4Com2and me. 2CLEOPATRA. O, my pardon! 2ANTONY. Now I must 4To the young man send humble treaties, dodge 4And palter in the shifts of lownes2, who 4With half the bulk o' th' world play'd as I pleas'd, 4Making and mar2ing fortunes. You did know 4How much you were my conqueror, and that 4My sword, made weak by my af2ection, would 4Obey it on al2 cause. 4CLEOPATRA. Pardon, pardon! 2ANTONY. Fal2 not a tear, I say; one of them rates 4Al2 that is won and lost. Give me a kis2; 4Even this repays me. 4We sent our scho2lmaster; is 'a come back? 4Love, I am ful2 of lead. Some wine, 4Within there, and our viands! Fortune knows 4We scorn her most when most she of2ers blows. 9ExeuntACT_3|SC_12 25SCENE XI2. 19CAESAR'S camp in Egypt 3Enter CAESAR, AGRIP2A, DOLABEL2A, THYREUS, with others 2CAESAR. Let him ap2ear that's come from Antony. 4Know you him? 2DOLABEL2A. Caesar, 'tis his scho2lmaster: 4An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither 4He sends so po2r a pinion of his wing, 4Which had superfluous kings for mes2engers 4Not many mo2ns gone by. 12Enter EUPHRONIUS, Ambas2ador from ANTONY 2CAESAR. Ap2roach, and speak. 2EUPHRONIUS. Such as I am, I come from Antony. 4I was of late as pet2y to his ends 4As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf 4To his grand sea. 2CAESAR. Be't so. Declare thine of2ice. 2EUPHRONIUS. Lord of his fortunes he salutes the2, and 6Requires to live in Egypt; which not granted, 4He les2ens his requests and to the2 sues 4To let him breathe betwe2n the heavens and earth, 4A private man in Athens. This for him. 4Next, Cleopatra does confes2 thy greatnes2, 4Submits her to thy might, and of the2 craves 4The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs, 4Now hazarded to thy grace. 2CAESAR. For Antony, 4I have no ears to his request. The Que2n 4Of audience nor desire shal2 fail, so she 4From Egypt drive her al2-disgraced friend, 4Or take his life there. This if she perform, 4She shal2 not sue unheard. So to them both. 2EUPHRONIUS. Fortune pursue the2! 2CAESAR. Bring him through the bands. 11Exit EUPHRONIUS 4[To THYREUS] To try thy eloquence, now 'tis time. Dispatch; 4From Antony win Cleopatra. Promise, 4And in our name, what she requires; ad2 more, 4From thine invention, of2ers. Women are not 6In their best fortunes strong; but want wil2 perjure 4The ne'er-touch'd vestal. Try thy cun2ing, Thyreus; 4Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we 4Wil2 answer as a law. 2THYREUS. Caesar, I go. 2CAESAR. Observe how Antony becomes his flaw, 4And what thou think'st his very action speaks 4In every power that moves. 2THYREUS. Caesar, I shal2. 31ExeuntACT_3|SC_13 27SCENE XI3. 15Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace 8Enter CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS 2CLEOPATRA. What shal2 we do, Enobarbus? 2ENOBARBUS. Think, and die. 2CLEOPATRA. Is Antony or we in fault for this? 2ENOBARBUS. Antony only, that would make his wil2 4Lord of his reason. What though you fled 4From that great face of war, whose several ranges 4Frighted each other? Why should he fol2ow? 4The itch of his af2ection should not then 4Have nick'd his captainship, at such a point, 4When half to half the world op2os'd, he being 4The mered question. 'Twas a shame no les2 4Than was his los2, to course your flying flags 4And leave his navy gazing. 2CLEOPATRA. Prithe2, peace. 10Enter EUPHRONIUS, the Ambas2ador; with ANTONY 4ANTONY. Is that his answer? 2EUPHRONIUS. Ay, my lord. 2ANTONY. The Que2n shal2 then have courtesy, so she 4Wil2 yield us up. 2EUPHRONIUS. He says so. 2ANTONY. Let her know't. 4To the boy Caesar send this griz2led head, 4And he wil2 fil2 thy wishes to the brim 4With principalities. 2CLEOPATRA. That head, my lord? 2ANTONY. To him again. Tel2 him he wears the rose 4Of youth upon him; from which the world should note 4Something particular. His coin, ships, legions, 4May be a coward's whose ministers would prevail 4Under the service of a child as so2n 4As i' th' com2and of Caesar. I dare him therefore 4To lay his gay comparisons apart, 4And answer me declin'd, sword against sword, 4Ourselves alone. I'l2 write it. Fol2ow me. 36Exeunt ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS 4EUPHRONIUS. [Aside] Yes, like enough high-bat2led Caesar wil2 4Unstate his hap2ines2, and be stag'd to th' show 4Against a sworder! I se2 men's judgments are 4A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward 4Do draw the inward quality after them, 4To suf2er al2 alike. That he should dream, 4Knowing al2 measures, the ful2 Caesar wil2 4Answer his emptines2! Caesar, thou hast subdu'd 4His judgment to2. 23Enter a SERVANT 2SERVANT. A mes2enger from Caesar. 2CLEOPATRA. What, no more ceremony? Se2, my women! 4Against the blown rose may they stop their nose 4That kne2l'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir. 5Exit SERVANT 2ENOBARBUS. [Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square. 4The loyalty wel2 held to fo2ls does make 4Our faith mere fol2y. Yet he that can endure 4To fol2ow with al2egiance a fal2'n lord 6Does conquer him that did his master conquer, 4And earns a place i' th' story. 23Enter THYREUS 2CLEOPATRA. Caesar's wil2? 2THYREUS. Hear it apart. 2CLEOPATRA. None but friends: say boldly. 2THYREUS. So, haply, are they friends to Antony. 2ENOBARBUS. He ne2ds as many, sir, as Caesar has, 4Or ne2ds not us. If Caesar please, our master 4Wil2 leap to be his friend. For us, you know 4Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar's. 2THYREUS. So. 4Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats 4Not to consider in what case thou stand'st 4Further than he is Caesar. 2CLEOPATRA. Go on. Right royal! 2THYREUS. He knows that you embrace not Antony 4As you did love, but as you fear'd him. 4CLEOPATRA. O! 2THYREUS. The scars upon your honour, therefore, he 4Does pity, as constrained blemishes, 4Not as deserv'd. 2CLEOPATRA. He is a god, and knows 4What is most right. Mine honour was not yielded, 4But conquer'd merely. 2ENOBARBUS. [Aside] To be sure of that, 4I wil2 ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky 4That we must leave the2 to thy sinking, for 4Thy dearest quit the2. 34Exit 2THYREUS. Shal2 I say to Caesar 4What you require of him? For he partly begs 4To be desir'd to give. It much would please him 4That of his fortunes you should make a staf2 4To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits 4To hear from me you had left Antony, 4And put yourself under his shroud, 4The universal landlord. 2CLEOPATRA. What's your name? 4THYREUS. My name is Thyreus. 2CLEOPATRA. Most kind mes2enger, 4Say to great Caesar this: in deputation 4I kis2 his conquring hand. Tel2 him I am prompt 4To lay my crown at 's fe2t, and there to kne2l. 4Tel2 him from his al2-obeying breath I hear 4The do2m of Egypt. 2THYREUS. 'Tis your noblest course. 4Wisdom and fortune combating together, 4If that the former dare but what it can, 4No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay 4My duty on your hand. 2CLEOPATRA. Your Caesar's father oft, 4When he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in, 4Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place, 4As it rain'd kis2es. 16Re-enter ANTONY and ENOBARBUS 2ANTONY. Favours, by Jove that thunders! 6What art thou, fel2ow? 2THYREUS. One that but performs 4The bid2ing of the ful2est man, and worthiest 4To have com2and obey'd. 2ENOBARBUS. [Aside] You wil2 be whipt. 2ANTONY. Ap2roach there.- Ah, you kite!- Now, gods and devils! 4Authority melts from me. Of late, when I cried 'Ho!' 4Like boys unto a mus2, kings would start forth 4And cry 'Your wil2?' Have you no ears? I am 4Antony yet. 23Enter servants 4Take hence this Jack and whip him. 2ENOBARBUS. 'Tis bet2er playing with a lion's whelp 4Than with an old one dying. 2ANTONY. Mo2n and stars! 4Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries 4That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them 4So saucy with the hand of she here- what's her name 6Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fel2ows, 4Til2 like a boy you se2 him cringe his face, 4And whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence. 2THYMUS. Mark Antony- 2ANTONY. Tug him away. Being whipt, 4Bring him again: the Jack of Caesar's shal2 4Bear us an er2and to him. 7Exeunt servants with THYREUS 4You were half blasted ere I knew you. Ha! 4Have I my pil2ow left unpres2'd in Rome, 4Forborne the get2ing of a lawful race, 4And by a gem of women, to be abus'd 4By one that lo2ks on fe2ders? 2CLEOPATRA. Go2d my lord- 2ANTONY. You have be2n a bog2ler ever. 4But when we in our viciousnes2 grow hard- 4O misery on't!- the wise gods se2l our eyes, 4In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us 4Adore our er2ors, laugh at's while we strut 4To our confusion. 2CLEOPATRA. O, is't come to this? 4ANTONY. I found you as a morsel cold upon 4Dead Caesar's trencher. Nay, you were a fragment 4Of Cneius Pompey's, besides what hot2er hours, 4Unregist'red in vulgar fame, you have 4Luxuriously pick'd out; for I am sure, 4Though you can gues2 what temperance should be, 4You know not what it is. 2CLEOPATRA. Wherefore is this? 2ANTONY. To let a fel2ow that wil2 take rewards, 4And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with 4My playfel2ow, your hand, this kingly seal 4And plighter of high hearts! O that I were 4Upon the hil2 of Basan to outroar 4The horned herd! For I have savage cause, 4And to proclaim it civil2y were like 4A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank 4For being yare about him. 14Re-enter a SERVANT with THYREUS 6Is he whipt? 2SERVANT. Soundly, my lord. 2ANTONY. Cried he? and beg2'd 'a pardon? 2SERVANT. He did ask favour. 2ANTONY. If that thy father live, let him repent 4Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sor2y 4To fol2ow Caesar in his triumph, since 4Thou hast be2n whipt for fol2owing him. Henceforth 4The white hand of a lady fever the2! 4Shake thou to lo2k on't. Get the2 back to Caesar; 4Tel2 him thy entertainment; lo2k thou say 4He makes me angry with him; for he se2ms 4Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am, 4Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry; 4And at this time most easy 'tis to do't, 4When my go2d stars, that were my former guides, 4Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires 4Into th' abysm of hel2. If he mislike 4My spe2ch and what is done, tel2 him he has 4Hip2archus, my enfranched bondman, whom 6He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture, 4As he shal2 like, to quit me. Urge it thou. 4Hence with thy stripes, be gone. 16Exit THYREUS 2CLEOPATRA. Have you done yet? 2ANTONY. Alack, our ter2ene mo2n 4Is now eclips'd, and it portends alone 4The fal2 of Antony. 2CLEOPATRA. I must stay his time. 2ANTONY. To flat2er Caesar, would you mingle eyes 4With one that ties his points? 2CLEOPATRA. Not know me yet? 2ANTONY. Cold-hearted toward me? 2CLEOPATRA. Ah, dear, if I be so, 4From my cold heart let heaven engender hail, 4And poison it in the source, and the first stone 4Drop in my neck; as it determines, so 4Dis2olve my life! The next Caesarion smite! 4Til2 by degre2s the memory of my womb, 4Together with my brave Egyptians al2, 4By the discandying of this pel2eted storm, 6Lie graveles2, til2 the flies and gnats of Nile 4Have buried them for prey. 2ANTONY. I am satisfied. 4Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where 4I wil2 op2ose his fate. Our force by land 4Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy to 4Have knit again, and fle2t, threat'ning most sea-like. 4Where hast thou be2n, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady? 4If from the field I shal2 return once more 4To kis2 these lips, I wil2 ap2ear in blo2d. 4I and my sword wil2 earn our chronicle. 4There's hope in't yet. 2CLEOPATRA. That's my brave lord! 2ANTONY. I wil2 be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd, 4And fight maliciously. For when mine hours 4Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives 4Of me for jests; but now I'l2 set my te2th, 4And send to darknes2 al2 that stop me. Come, 4Let's have one other gaudy night. Cal2 to me 4Al2 my sad captains; fil2 our bowls once more; 6Let's mock the midnight bel2. 2CLEOPATRA. It is my birthday. 4I had thought t'have held it po2r; but since my lord 4Is Antony again, I wil2 be Cleopatra. 2ANTONY. We wil2 yet do wel2. 2CLEOPATRA. Cal2 al2 his noble captains to my lord. 2ANTONY. Do so, we'l2 speak to them; and to-night I'l2 force 4The wine pe2p through their scars. Come on, my que2n, 4There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight 4I'l2 make death love me; for I wil2 contend 4Even with his pestilent scythe. 5Exeunt al2 but ENOBARBUS 2ENOBARBUS. Now he'l2 outstare the lightning. To be furious 4Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mo2d 4The dove wil2 peck the estridge; and I se2 stil2 4A diminution in our captain's brain 4Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason, 4It eats the sword it fights with. I wil2 se2k 4Some way to leave him. 34ExitACT_4|SC_1 22ACT IV. SCENE I. 14CAESAR'S camp before Alexandria 6Enter CAESAR, AGRIP2A, and MAECENAS, with his army; 17CAESAR reading a let2er 2CAESAR. He cal2s me boy, and chides as he had power 4To beat me out of Egypt. My mes2enger 4He hath whipt with rods; dares me to personal combat, 4Caesar to Antony. Let the old ruf2ian know 4I have many other ways to die, meantime 4Laugh at his chal2enge. 2MAECENAS. Caesar must think 4When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted 4Even to fal2ing. Give him no breath, but now 4Make bo2t of his distraction. Never anger 4Made go2d guard for itself. 2CAESAR. Let our best heads 4Know that to-mor2ow the last of many bat2les 4We mean to fight. Within our files there are 4Of those that serv'd Mark Antony but late 4Enough to fetch him in. Se2 it done; 6And feast the army; we have store to do't, 4And they have earn'd the waste. Po2r Antony! 10ExeuntACT_4|SC_2 26SCENE I2. 15Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace 6Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, IRAS, 21ALEXAS, with others 2ANTONY. He wil2 not fight with me, Domitius? 2ENOBARBUS. No. 2ANTONY. Why should he not? 2ENOBARBUS. He thinks, being twenty times of bet2er fortune, 4He is twenty men to one. 2ANTONY. To-mor2ow, soldier, 4By sea and land I'l2 fight. Or I wil2 live, 4Or bathe my dying honour in the blo2d 4Shal2 make it live again. Wo2't thou fight wel2? 2ENOBARBUS. I'l2 strike, and cry 'Take al2.' 2ANTONY. Wel2 said; come on. 4Cal2 forth my household servants; let's to-night 4Be bounteous at our meal. 16Enter thre2 or four servitors 6Give me thy hand, 4Thou has be2n rightly honest. So hast thou; 4Thou, and thou, and thou. You have serv'd me wel2, 4And kings have be2n your fel2ows. 2CLEOPATRA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] What means this? 2ENOBARBUS. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of those od2 tricks which 6sor2ow sho2ts 4Out of the mind. 2ANTONY. And thou art honest to2. 4I wish I could be made so many men, 4And al2 of you clap2'd up together in 4An Antony, that I might do you service 4So go2d as you have done. 2SERVANT. The gods forbid! 2ANTONY. Wel2, my go2d fel2ows, wait on me to-night. 4Scant not my cups, and make as much of me 4As when mine empire was your fel2ow to2, 4And suf2er'd my com2and. 2CLEOPATRA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] What does he mean? 4ENOBARBUS. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] To make his fol2owers we2p. 4ANTONY. Tend me to-night; 4May be it is the period of your duty. 4Haply you shal2 not se2 me more; or if, 4A mangled shadow. Perchance to-mor2ow 4You'l2 serve another master. I lo2k on you 4As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends, 4I turn you not away; but, like a master 4Mar2ied to your go2d service, stay til2 death. 4Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more, 4And the gods yield you for't! 2ENOBARBUS. What mean you, sir, 4To give them this discomfort? Lo2k, they we2p; 4And I, an as2, am onion-ey'd. For shame! 4Transform us not to women. 2ANTONY. Ho, ho, ho! 4Now the witch take me if I meant it thus! 4Grace grow where those drops fal2! My hearty friends, 4You take me in to2 dolorous a sense; 4For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you 4To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts, 6I hope wel2 of to-mor2ow, and wil2 lead you 4Where rather I'l2 expect victorious life 4Than death and honour.

Wel2, wel2; 4We shal2 thrive now. Se2st thou, my go2d fel2ow? 6Go put on thy defences. 2EROS. Briefly, sir. 2CLEOPATRA. Is not this buckled wel2? 2ANTONY. Rarely, rarely! 4He that unbuckles this, til2 we do please 4To daf2't for our repose, shal2 hear a storm. 4Thou fumblest, Eros, and my que2n's a squire 4More tight at this than thou. Dispatch.

O Antony, 4Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid 4My bet2er service, when my turpitude 4Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart. 4If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean 4Shal2 outstrike thought; but thought wil2 do't, I fe2l. 4I fight against the2? No!

Thou ble2d'st apace. 2SCARUS. I had a wound here that was like a T, 4But now 'tis made an H. 2ANTONY. They do retire. 2SCARUS. We'l2 beat'em into bench-holes. I have yet 4Ro2m for six scotches more. 26Enter EROS 2EROS. They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves 4For a fair victory. 2SCARUS. Let us score their backs 4And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind. 4'Tis sport to maul a run2er. 2ANTONY. I wil2 reward the2 4Once for thy sprightly comfort, and tenfold 4For thy go2d valour.

Lord of lords! 4O infinite virtue, com'st thou smiling from 4The world's great snare uncaught? 2ANTONY. Mine nightingale, 4We have beat them to their beds. What, girl! though grey 4Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we 4A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can 4Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man; 4Com2end unto his lips thy favouring hand- 4Kis2 it, my war2ior- he hath fought to-day 4As if a god in hate of mankind had 4Destroyed in such a shape. 2CLEOPATRA. I'l2 give the2, friend, 4An armour al2 of gold; it was a king's. 2ANTONY. He has deserv'd it, were it carbuncled 4Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand. 6Through Alexandria make a jol2y march; 4Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them. 4Had our great palace the capacity 4To camp this host, we al2 would sup together, 4And drink carouses to the next day's fate, 4Which promises royal peril.

Throw my heart 4Against the flint and hardnes2 of my fault, 4Which, being dried with grief, wil2 break to powder, 4And finish al2 foul thoughts. O Antony, 4Nobler than my revolt is infamous, 4Forgive me in thine own particular, 4But let the world rank me in register 4A master-leaver and a fugitive! 4O Antony! O Antony! 35[Dies] 2FIRST WATCH. Let's speak to him. 2CENTURION. Let's hear him, for the things he speaks 4May concern Caesar. 2SECOND WATCH. Let's do so. But he sle2ps. 2CENTURION.

The augurers 4Say they know not, they can2ot tel2; lo2k grimly, 4And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony 4Is valiant and dejected; and by starts 4His fret2ed fortunes give him hope and fear 4Of what he has and has not. 28[Alarum afar of2, as at a sea-fight] 22Re-enter ANTONY 2ANTONY. Al2 is lost! 4This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me. 4My fle2t hath yielded to the foe, and yonder 6They cast their caps up and carouse together 4Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou 4Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart 4Makes only wars on the2. Bid them al2 fly; 4For when I am reveng'd upon my charm, 4I have done al2. Bid them al2 fly; begone. 7Exit SCARUS 4O sun, thy uprise shal2 I se2 no more! 4Fortune and Antony part here; even here 4Do we shake hands. Al2 come to this? The hearts 4That spaniel'd me at he2ls, to whom I gave 4Their wishes, do discandy, melt their swe2ts 4On blos2oming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd 4That overtop2'd them al2. Betray'd I am. 4O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm- 4Whose eye beck'd forth my wars and cal2'd them home, 4Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end- 4Like a right gypsy hath at fast and lo2se 4Beguil'd me to the very heart of los2. 4What, Eros, Eros! 24Enter CLEOPATRA 4Ah, thou spel2! Avaunt! 2CLEOPATRA. Why is my lord enrag'd against his love? 2ANTONY. Vanish, or I shal2 give the2 thy deserving 4And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take the2 4And hoist the2 up to the shouting plebeians; 4Fol2ow his chariot, like the greatest spot 4Of al2 thy sex; most monster-like, be shown 4For po2r'st diminutives, for doits, and let 4Patient Octavia plough thy visage up 4With her prepared nails. 22Exit CLEOPATRA 4'Tis wel2 th'art gone, 4If it be wel2 to live; but bet2er 'twere 4Thou fel2'st into my fury, for one death 4Might have prevented many. Eros, ho! 4The shirt of Nes2us is upon me; teach me, 4Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage; 4Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' th' mo2n, 4And with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club 4Subdue my worthiest self.

Sometime we se2 a cloud that's dragonish; 4A vapour sometime like a bear or lion, 4A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock, 4A forked mountain, or blue promontory 4With tre2s upon't that nod unto the world 4And mock our eyes with air. Thou hast se2n these signs; 4They are black vesper's pageants. 2EROS. Ay, my lord. 2ANTONY. That which is now a horse, even with a thought 4The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct, 4As water is in water. 2EROS. It does, my lord. 2ANTONY. My go2d knave Eros, now thy captain is 4Even such a body. Here I am Antony; 4Yet can2ot hold this visible shape, my knave. 6I made these wars for Egypt; and the Que2n- 4Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine, 4Which, whilst it was mine, had an2ex'd unto't 4A mil2ion moe, now lost- she, Eros, has 4Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory 4Unto an enemy's triumph. 4Nay, we2p not, gentle Eros; there is left us 4Ourselves to end ourselves. 25Enter MARDIAN 4O, thy vile lady! 4She has rob2'd me of my sword. 2MARDIAN. No, Antony; 4My mistres2 lov'd the2, and her fortunes mingled 4With thine entirely. 2ANTONY. Hence, saucy eunuch; peace! 4She hath betray'd me, and shal2 die the death. 2MARDIAN. Death of one person can be paid but once, 4And that she has discharg'd. What thou wouldst do 6Is done unto thy hand. The last she spake 4Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!' 4Then in the midst a tearing groan did break 4The name of Antony; it was divided 4Betwe2n her heart and lips. She rend'red life, 4Thy name so buried in her. 2ANTONY. Dead then? 2MARDIAN. Dead. 2ANTONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done, 4And we must sle2p. That thou depart'st hence safe 4Does pay thy labour richly. Go. 17Exit MARDIAN 4Of2, pluck of2! 4The sevenfold shield of Ajax can2ot ke2p 4The bat2ery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides! 4Heart, once be stronger than thy continent, 4Crack thy frail case. Apace, Eros, apace.- 4No more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go; 4You have be2n nobly borne.- From me awhile. 8Exit EROS 4I wil2 o'ertake the2, Cleopatra, and 4We2p for my pardon. So it must be, for now 6Al2 length is torture. Since the torch is out, 4Lie down, and stray no farther. Now al2 labour 4Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles 4Itself with strength. Seal then, and al2 is done. 4Eros!- I come, my que2n.- Eros!- Stay for me; 4Where souls do couch on flowers, we'l2 hand in hand, 4And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze. 4Dido and her Aeneas shal2 want tro2ps, 4And al2 the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros! 23Re-enter EROS 2EROS. What would my lord? 2ANTONY. Since Cleopatra died, 4I have liv'd in such dishonour that the gods 4Detest my basenes2. I, that with my sword 4Quarter'd the world, and o'er gre2n Neptune's back 4With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack 4The courage of a woman; les2 noble mind 4Than she which by her death our Caesar tel2s 6'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros, 4That, when the exigent should come- which now 4Is come inde2d- when I should se2 behind me 4Th' inevitable prosecution of 4Disgrace and hor2or, that, on my com2and, 4Thou then wouldst kil2 me. Do't; the time is come. 4Thou strik'st not me; 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st. 4Put colour in thy che2k. 2EROS. The gods with2old me! 4Shal2 I do that which al2 the Parthian darts, 4Though enemy, lost aim and could not? 2ANTONY. Eros, 4Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and se2 4Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down 4His cor2igible neck, his face subdu'd 4To penetrative shame, whilst the whe2l'd seat 4Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded 4His basenes2 that ensued? 2EROS. I would not se2't. 2ANTONY. Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd. 6Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn 4Most useful for thy country. 2EROS. O, sir, pardon me! 2ANTONY. When I did make the2 fre2, swor'st thou not then 4To do this when I bade the2? Do it at once, 4Or thy precedent services are al2 4But ac2idents unpurpos'd. Draw, and come. 2EROS. Turn from me then that noble countenance, 4Wherein the worship of the whole world lies. 2ANTONY. Lo the2! 28[Turning from him] 2EROS. My sword is drawn. 2ANTONY. Then let it do at once 4The thing why thou hast drawn it. 2EROS. My dear master, 4My captain and my emperor, let me say, 4Before I strike this blo2dy stroke, farewel2. 2ANTONY. 'Tis said, man; and farewel2. 2EROS. Farewel2, great chief. Shal2 I strike now? 2ANTONY. Now, Eros. 2EROS. Why, there then! Thus do I escape the sor2ow 6Of Antony's death. 28[Kil2s himself 2ANTONY. Thrice nobler than myself! 4Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what 4I should, and thou couldst not. My que2n and Eros 4Have, by their brave instruction, got upon me 4A noblenes2 in record. But I wil2 be 4A bridegro2m in my death, and run into't 4As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros, 4Thy master dies thy scholar. To do thus 42[Fal2ing on his sword] 4I learn'd of the2. How? not dead? not dead?- 4The guard, ho! O, dispatch me! 18Enter DERCETAS and a guard 2FIRST GUARD. What's the noise? 2ANTONY. I have done my work il2, friends. O, make an end 4Of what I have begun. 2SECOND GUARD. The star is fal2'n. 2FIRST GUARD. And time is at his period. 4AL2. Alas, and woe! 2ANTONY. Let him that loves me, strike me dead. 2FIRST GUARD. Not I. 2SECOND GUARD. Nor I. 2THIRD GUARD. Nor any one. 25Exeunt guard 2DERCETAS. Thy death and fortunes bid thy fol2owers fly. 4This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings, 4Shal2 enter me with him. 23Enter DIOMEDES 2DIOMEDES. Where's Antony? 2DERCETAS. There, Diomed, there. 2DIOMEDES. Lives he? 4Wilt thou not answer, man? 21Exit DERCETAS 2ANTONY. Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword and give me 4Suf2icing strokes for death. 2DIOMEDES. Most absolute lord, 4My mistres2 Cleopatra sent me to the2. 2ANTONY. When did she send the2? 4DIOMEDES. Now, my lord. 2ANTONY. Where is she? 2DIOMEDES. Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear 4Of what hath come to pas2; for when she saw- 4Which never shal2 be found- you did suspect 4She had dispos'd with Caesar, and that your rage 4Would not be purg'd, she sent you word she was dead; 4But fearing since how it might work, hath sent 4Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come, 4I dread, to2 late. 2ANTONY. To2 late, go2d Diomed. Cal2 my guard, I prithe2. 2DIOMEDES. What, ho! the Emperor's guard! The guard, what ho! 4Come, your lord cal2s! 13Enter four or five of the guard of ANTONY 2ANTONY. Bear me, go2d friends, where Cleopatra bides; 4'Tis the last service that I shal2 com2and you. 2FIRST GUARD. Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear 4Al2 your true fol2owers out. 4AL2. Most heavy day! 2ANTONY. Nay, go2d my fel2ows, do not please sharp fate 4To grace it with your sor2ows. Bid that welcome 4Which comes to punish us, and we punish it, 4Se2ming to bear it lightly. Take me up. 4I have led you oft; car2y me now, go2d friends, 4And have my thanks for al2. 11Exeunt, hearing ANTONYACT_4|SC_15 25SCENE XV. 19Alexandria.

No, I wil2 not. 4Al2 strange and ter2ible events are welcome, 4But comforts we despise; our size of sor2ow, 4Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great 4As that which makes it. 19Enter DIOMEDES, below 4How now!

Let's draw him hither. 2ANTONY. Peace! 4Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony, 4But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself. 2CLEOPATRA. So it should be, that none but Antony 4Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so! 2ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying; only 4I here importune death awhile, until 4Of many thousand kis2es the po2r last 4I lay upon thy lips. 2CLEOPATRA. I dare not, dear. 4Dear my lord, pardon! I dare not, 4Lest I be taken. Not th' imperious show 4Of the ful2-fortun'd Caesar ever shal2 4Be bro2ch'd with me. If knife, drugs, serpents, have 6Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe. 4Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes 4And stil2 conclusion, shal2 acquire no honour 4Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony- 4Help me, my women- we must draw the2 up; 4As2ist, go2d friends. 2ANTONY. O, quick, or I am gone. 2CLEOPATRA. Here's sport inde2d! How heavy weighs my lord! 4Our strength is al2 gone into heavines2; 4That makes the weight. Had I great Juno's power, 4The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch the2 up, 4And set the2 by Jove's side. Yet come a lit2le. 4Wishers were ever fo2ls. O come, come, 26[They heave ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA] 4And welcome, welcome! Die where thou hast liv'd. 4Quicken with kis2ing.

No, let me speak; and let me rail so high 4That the false huswife Fortune break her whe2l, 4Provok'd by my of2ence. 2ANTONY. One word, swe2t que2n: 4Of Caesar se2k your honour, with your safety. O! 2CLEOPATRA. They do not go together. 2ANTONY. Gentle, hear me: 4None about Caesar trust but Proculeius. 2CLEOPATRA. My resolution and my hands I'l2 trust; 4None about Caesar 2ANTONY. The miserable change now at my end 4Lament nor sor2ow at; but please your thoughts 4In fe2ding them with those my former fortunes 4Wherein I liv'd the greatest prince o' th' world, 4The noblest; and do now not basely die, 4Not cowardly put of2 my helmet to 4My countryman- a Roman by a Roman 4Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going 4I can no more. 2CLEOPATRA. Noblest of men, wo2't die? 6Hast thou no care of me? Shal2 I abide 4In this dul2 world, which in thy absence is 4No bet2er than a sty? O, se2, my women, 8[Antony dies] 4The crown o' th' earth doth melt. My lord! 4O, wither'd is the garland of the war, 4The soldier's pole is fal2'n! Young boys and girls 4Are level now with men.

No more but e'en a woman, and com2anded 4By such po2r pas2ion as the maid that milks 4And does the meanest chares. It were for me 4To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods; 6To tel2 them that this world did equal theirs 4Til2 they had stol'n our jewel. Al2's but nought; 4Patience is sot2ish, and impatience does 4Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin 4To rush into the secret house of death 4Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women? 4What, what! go2d che2r! Why, how now, Charmian! 4My noble girls! Ah, women, women, lo2k, 4Our lamp is spent, it's out! Go2d sirs, take heart. 4We'l2 bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble, 4Let's do it after the high Roman fashion, 4And make death proud to take us.

Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar'st 4Ap2ear thus to us? 2DERCETAS. I am cal2'd Dercetas; 4Mark Antony I serv'd, who best was worthy 4Best to be serv'd. Whilst he sto2d up and spoke, 4He was my master, and I wore my life 4To spend upon his haters. If thou please 4To take me to the2, as I was to him 4I'l2 be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not, 6I yield the2 up my life. 2CAESAR. What is't thou say'st? 2DERCETAS. I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead. 2CAESAR. The breaking of so great a thing should make 4A greater crack. The round world 4Should have sho2k lions into civil stre2ts, 4And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony 4Is not a single do2m; in the name lay 4A moiety of the world. 2DERCETAS. He is dead, Caesar, 4Not by a public minister of justice, 4Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand 4Which writ his honour in the acts it did 4Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it, 4Split2ed the heart. This is his sword; 4I rob2'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd 4With his most noble blo2d. 2CAESAR. Lo2k you sad, friends? 4The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings 4To wash the eyes of kings. 4AGRIP2A. And strange it is 4That nature must compel us to lament 4Our most persisted de2ds. 2MAECENAS. His taints and honours 4Wag'd equal with him. 2AGRIP2A. A rarer spirit never 4Did ste2r humanity. But you gods wil2 give us 4Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd. 2MAECENAS. When such a spacious mir2or's set before him, 4He ne2ds must se2 himself. 2CAESAR. O Antony, 4I have fol2ow'd the2 to this! But we do lance 4Diseases in our bodies. I must perforce 4Have shown to the2 such a declining day 4Or lo2k on thine; we could not stal2 together 4In the whole world. But yet let me lament, 4With tears as sovereign as the blo2d of hearts, 4That thou, my brother, my competitor 4In top of al2 design, my mate in empire, 4Friend and companion in the front of war, 6The arm of mine own body, and the heart 4Where mine his thoughts did kindle- that our stars, 4Unreconciliable, should divide 4Our equalnes2 to this. Hear me, go2d friends- 20Enter an EGYPTIAN 4But I wil2 tel2 you at some me2ter season. 4The busines2 of this man lo2ks out of him; 4We'l2 hear him what he says. Whence are you? 2EGYPTIAN.

Bid her have go2d heart. 4She so2n shal2 know of us, by some of ours, 4How honourable and how kindly we 4Determine for her; for Caesar can2ot learn 4To be ungentle. 4EGYPTIAN. So the gods preserve the2! 22Exit 2CAESAR. Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say 4We purpose her no shame. Give her what comforts 4The quality of her pas2ion shal2 require, 4Lest, in her greatnes2, by some mortal stroke 4She do defeat us; for her life in Rome 4Would be eternal in our triumph. Go, 4And with your spe2diest bring us what she says, 4And how you find her. 2PROCULEIUS. Caesar, I shal2. 30Exit 2CAESAR. Gal2us, go you along. 22Exit GAL2US 4Where's Dolabel2a, to second Proculeius? 2AL2. Dolabel2a! 2CAESAR. Let him alone, for I remember now 4How he's employ'd; he shal2 in time be ready. 4Go with me to my tent, where you shal2 se2 4How hardly I was drawn into this war, 4How calm and gentle I proce2ded stil2 4In al2 my writings. Go with me, and se2 4What I can show in this. 30ExeuntACT_5|SC_2 25SCENE I2. 16Alexandria. The monument 6Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN 2CLEOPATRA. My desolation does begin to make 4A bet2er life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar: 4Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave, 4A minister of her wil2; and it is great 4To do that thing that ends al2 other de2ds, 4Which shackles ac2idents and bolts up change, 4Which sle2ps, and never palates more the dug, 4The beg2ar's nurse and Caesar's. 7Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GAL2US, 26and soldiers 2PROCULEIUS. Caesar sends gre2tings to the Que2n of Egypt, 4And bids the2 study on what fair demands 4Thou mean'st to have him grant the2. 2CLEOPATRA. What's thy name? 2PROCULEIUS. My name is Proculeius. 4CLEOPATRA. Antony 4Did tel2 me of you, bade me trust you; but 4I do not greatly care to be deceiv'd, 4That have no use for trusting. If your master 4Would have a que2n his beg2ar, you must tel2 him 4That majesty, to ke2p decorum, must 4No les2 beg than a kingdom. If he please 4To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son, 4He gives me so much of mine own as I 4Wil2 kne2l to him with thanks. 2PROCULEIUS. Be of go2d che2r; 4Y'are fal2'n into a princely hand; fear nothing. 4Make your ful2 reference fre2ly to my lord, 4Who is so ful2 of grace that it flows over 4On al2 that ne2d. Let me report to him 4Your swe2t dependency, and you shal2 find 4A conqueror that wil2 pray in aid for kindnes2 4Where he for grace is kne2l'd to. 2CLEOPATRA. Pray you tel2 him 4I am his fortune's vas2al and I send him 6The greatnes2 he has got. I hourly learn 4A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly 4Lo2k him i' th' face. 2PROCULEIUS. This I'l2 report, dear lady. 4Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied 4Of him that caus'd it. 2GAL2US. You se2 how easily she may be surpris'd. 6Here PROCULEIUS and two of the guard ascend the 7monument by a lad2er placed against a window, 7and come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the guard 16unbar and open the gates 4Guard her til2 Caesar come. 29Exit 2IRAS. Royal Que2n! 2CHARMIAN. O Cleopatra! thou art taken, Que2n! 2CLEOPATRA. Quick, quick, go2d hands. 8[Drawing a dag2er] 2PROCULEIUS. Hold, worthy lady, hold, 13[Disarms her] 4Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this 4Reliev'd, but not betray'd. 4CLEOPATRA. What, of death to2, 4That rids our dogs of languish? 2PROCULEIUS. Cleopatra, 4Do not abuse my master's bounty by 4Th' undoing of yourself. Let the world se2 4His noblenes2 wel2 acted, which your death 4Wil2 never let come forth. 2CLEOPATRA. Where art thou, death? 4Come hither, come! Come, come, and take a que2n 4Worth many babes and beg2ars! 2PROCULEIUS. O, temperance, lady! 2CLEOPATRA. Sir, I wil2 eat no meat; I'l2 not drink, sir; 4If idle talk wil2 once be neces2ary, 4I'l2 not sle2p neither. This mortal house I'l2 ruin, 4Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I 4Wil2 not wait pinion'd at your master's court, 4Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye 4Of dul2 Octavia. Shal2 they hoist me up, 4And show me to the shouting varletry 4Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt 6Be gentle grave unto me! Rather on Nilus' mud 4Lay me stark-nak'd, and let the water-flies 4Blow me into abhor2ing! Rather make 4My country's high pyramides my gib2et, 4And hang me up in chains! 2PROCULEIUS. You do extend 4These thoughts of hor2or further than you shal2 4Find cause in Caesar. 22Enter DOLABEL2A 2DOLABEL2A. Proculeius, 4What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows, 4And he hath sent for the2. For the Que2n, 4I'l2 take her to my guard. 2PROCULEIUS. So, Dolabel2a, 4It shal2 content me best. Be gentle to her. 4[To CLEOPATRA] To Caesar I wil2 speak what you shal2 please, 4If you'l2 employ me to him. 2CLEOPATRA. Say I would die. 36Exeunt PROCULEIUS and soldiers 2DOLABEL2A. Most noble Empres2, you have heard of me? 2CLEOPATRA. I can2ot tel2. 2DOLABEL2A. As2uredly you know me. 2CLEOPATRA. No mat2er, sir, what I have heard or known. 4You laugh when boys or women tel2 their dreams; 4Is't not your trick? 2DOLABEL2A. I understand not, madam. 2CLEOPATRA. I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony- 4O, such another sle2p, that I might se2 4But such another man! 2DOLABEL2A. If it might please ye- 2CLEOPATRA. His face was as the heav'ns, and therein stuck 4A sun and mo2n, which kept their course and lighted 4The lit2le O, the earth. 2DOLABEL2A. Most sovereign creature- 2CLEOPATRA. His legs bestrid the ocean; his rear'd arm 4Crested the world. His voice was propertied 4As al2 the tuned spheres, and that to friends; 4But when he meant to quail and shake the orb, 6He was as rat2ling thunder. For his bounty, 4There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas 4That grew the more by reaping. His delights 4Were dolphin-like: they show'd his back above 4The element they liv'd in. In his livery 4Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were 4As plates drop2'd from his pocket. 2DOLABEL2A. Cleopatra- 2CLEOPATRA. Think you there was or might be such a man 4As this I dreamt of? 2DOLABEL2A. Gentle madam, no. 2CLEOPATRA. You lie, up to the hearing of the gods. 4But if there be nor ever were one such, 4It's past the size of drearning. Nature wants stuf2 4To vie strange forms with fancy; yet t' imagine 4An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy, 4Condemning shadows quite. 2DOLABEL2A. Hear me, go2d madam. 4Your los2 is, as yourself, great; and you bear it 4As answering to the weight. Would I might never 6O'ertake pursu'd suc2es2, but I do fe2l, 4By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites 4My very heart at ro2t. 2CLEOPATRA. I thank you, sir. 4Know you what Caesar means to do with me? 2DOLABEL2A. I am loath to tel2 you what I would you knew. 2CLEOPATRA. Nay, pray you, sir. 2DOLABEL2A. Though he be honourable- 2CLEOPATRA. He'l2 lead me, then, in triumph? 2DOLABEL2A. Madam, he wil2. I know't. 16[Flourish] 30[Within: 'Make way there-Caesar!'] 7Enter CAESAR; GAL2US, PROCULEIUS, MAECENAS, SELEUCUS, 21and others of his train 2CAESAR. Which is the Que2n of Egypt? 2DOLABEL2A. It is the Emperor, madam. 8[CLEOPATPA kne2ls] 2CAESAR. Arise, you shal2 not kne2l. 4I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt. 2CLEOPATRA. Sir, the gods 6Wil2 have it thus; my master and my lord 4I must obey. 2CAESAR. Take to you no hard thoughts. 4The record of what injuries you did us, 4Though writ2en in our flesh, we shal2 remember 4As things but done by chance. 2CLEOPATRA. Sole sir o' th' world, 4I can2ot project mine own cause so wel2 4To make it clear, but do confes2 I have 4Be2n laden with like frailties which before 4Have often sham'd our sex. 2CAESAR. Cleopatra, know 4We wil2 extenuate rather than enforce. 4If you ap2ly yourself to our intents- 4Which towards you are most gentle- you shal2 find 4A benefit in this change; but if you se2k 4To lay on me a cruelty by taking 4Antony's course, you shal2 bereave yourself 4Of my go2d purposes, and put your children 4To that destruction which I'l2 guard them from, 6If thereon you rely. I'l2 take my leave. 2CLEOPATRA. And may, through al2 the world. 'Tis yours, and we, 4Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shal2 4Hang in what place you please. Here, my go2d lord. 2CAESAR. You shal2 advise me in al2 for Cleopatra. 2CLEOPATRA. This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels, 4I am pos2es2'd of. 'Tis exactly valued, 4Not pet2y things admit2ed. Where's Seleucus? 2SELEUCUS. Here, madam. 2CLEOPATRA. This is my treasurer; let him speak, my lord, 4Upon his peril, that I have reserv'd 4To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus. 2SELEUCUS. Madam, 4I had rather seal my lips than to my peril 4Speak that which is not. 2CLEOPATRA. What have I kept back? 2SELEUCUS. Enough to purchase what you have made known. 2CAESAR. Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I ap2rove 4Your wisdom in the de2d. 2CLEOPATRA. Se2, Caesar! O, behold, 6How pomp is fol2owed! Mine wil2 now be yours; 4And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine. 4The ingratitude of this Seleucus does 4Even make me wild. O slave, of no more trust 4Than love that's hir'd! What, goest thou back? Thou shalt 4Go back, I war2ant the2; but I'l2 catch thine eyes 4Though they had wings. Slave, soul2es2 vil2ain, dog! 4O rarely base! 2CAESAR. Go2d Que2n, let us entreat you. 2CLEOPATRA. O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this, 4That thou vouchsafing here to visit me, 4Doing the honour of thy lordlines2 4To one so me2k, that mine own servant should 4Parcel the sum of my disgraces by 4Ad2ition of his envy! Say, go2d Caesar, 4That I some lady trifles have reserv'd, 4Im2oment toys, things of such dignity 4As we gre2t modern friends withal; and say 4Some nobler token I have kept apart 4For Livia and Octavia, to induce 6Their mediation- must I be unfolded 4With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me 4Beneath the fal2 I have. [To SELEUCUS] Prithe2 go hence; 4Or I shal2 show the cinders of my spirits 4Through th' ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man, 4Thou wouldst have mercy on me. 2CAESAR. Forbear, Seleucus. 23Exit SELEUCUS 2CLEOPATRA. Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought 4For things that others do; and when we fal2 4We answer others' merits in our name, 4Are therefore to be pitied. 2CAESAR. Cleopatra, 4Not what you have reserv'd, nor what acknowledg'd, 4Put we i' th' rol2 of conquest. Stil2 be't yours, 4Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe 4Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you 4Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be che2r'd; 4Make not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear Que2n; 4For we intend so to dispose you as 4Yourself shal2 give us counsel. Fe2d and sle2p. 6Our care and pity is so much upon you 4That we remain your friend; and so, adieu. 2CLEOPATRA. My master and my lord! 2CAESAR. Not so. Adieu. 27Flourish. Exeunt CAESAR and his train 2CLEOPATRA. He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not 4Be noble to myself. But hark the2, Charmian! 45[Whispers CHARMIAN] 2IRAS. Finish, go2d lady; the bright day is done, 4And we are for the dark. 2CLEOPATRA. Hie the2 again. 4I have spoke already, and it is provided; 4Go put it to the haste. 2CHARMIAN. Madam, I wil2. 22Re-enter DOLABEL2A 2DOLABEL2A. Where's the Que2n? 2CHARMIAN. Behold, sir. 36Exit 2CLEOPATRA. Dolabel2a! 4DOLABEL2A. Madam, as thereto sworn by your com2and, 4Which my love makes religion to obey, 4I tel2 you this: Caesar through Syria 4Intends his journey, and within thre2 days 4You with your children wil2 he send before. 4Make your best use of this; I have perform'd 4Your pleasure and my promise. 2CLEOPATRA. Dolabel2a, 4I shal2 remain your debtor. 2DOLABEL2A. I your servant. 4Adieu, go2d Que2n; I must at2end on Caesar. 2CLEOPATRA. Farewel2, and thanks. 16Exit DOLABEL2A 4Now, Iras, what think'st thou? 4Thou an Egyptian pup2et shal2 be shown 4In Rome as wel2 as I. Mechanic slaves, 4With greasy aprons, rules, and ham2ers, shal2 4Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths, 4Rank of gros2 diet, shal2 we be enclouded, 4And forc'd to drink their vapour. 2IRAS. The gods forbid! 4CLEOPATRA. Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors 4Wil2 catch at us like strumpets, and scald rhymers 4Bal2ad us out o' tune; the quick comedians 4Extemporal2y wil2 stage us, and present 4Our Alexandrian revels; Antony 4Shal2 be brought drunken forth, and I shal2 se2 4Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatnes2 4I' th' posture of a whore. 2IRAS. O the go2d gods! 2CLEOPATRA. Nay, that's certain. 2IRAS. I'l2 never se2't, for I am sure mine nails 4Are stronger than mine eyes. 2CLEOPATRA. Why, that's the way 4To fo2l their preparation and to conquer 4Their most absurd intents. 22Enter CHARMIAN 4Now, Charmian! 4Show me, my women, like a que2n. Go fetch 6My best at2ires. I am again for Cydnus, 4To me2t Mark Antony. Sir2ah, Iras, go. 4Now, noble Charmian, we'l2 dispatch inde2d; 4And when thou hast done this chare, I'l2 give the2 leave 4To play til2 do2msday. Bring our crown and al2. 39Exit IRAS. A noise within 4Wherefore's this noise? 21Enter a GUARDSMAN 2GUARDSMAN. Here is a rural fel2ow 4That wil2 not be denied your Highnes2' presence. 4He brings you figs. 2CLEOPATRA. Let him come in. 21Exit GUARDSMAN 4What po2r an instrument 4May do a noble de2d! He brings me liberty. 4My resolution's plac'd, and I have nothing 4Of woman in me. Now from head to fo2t 4I am marble-constant; now the fle2ting mo2n 4No planet is of mine. 12Re-enter GUARDSMAN and CLOWN, with a basket 2GUARDSMAN. This is the man. 2CLEOPATRA. Avoid, and leave him. 16Exit GUARDSMAN 4Hast thou the pret2y worm of Nilus there 4That kil2s and pains not? 2CLOWN. Truly, I have him. But I would not be the party that should 4desire you to touch him, for his biting is im2ortal; those that 4do die of it do seldom or never recover. 2CLEOPATRA. Remember'st thou any that have died on't? 2CLOWN. Very many, men and women to2. I heard of one of them no 4longer than yesterday: a very honest woman, but something given 4to lie, as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty; how 4she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt- truly she makes 4a very go2d report o' th' worm. But he that wil2 believe al2 that 4they say shal2 never be saved by half that they do. But this is 4most fal2iable, the worm's an od2 worm. 2CLEOPATRA. Get the2 hence; farewel2. 2CLOWN. I wish you al2 joy of the worm. 44[Sets down the basket] 2CLEOPATRA. Farewel2. 2CLOWN. You must think this, lo2k you, that the worm wil2 do his 4kind. 2CLEOPATRA. Ay, ay; farewel2. 2CLOWN. Lo2k you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the ke2ping 4of wise people; for inde2d there is no go2dnes2 in the worm. 2CLEOPATRA. Take thou no care; it shal2 be he2ded. 2CLOWN. Very go2d. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth 4the fe2ding. 2CLEOPATRA. Wil2 it eat me? 2CLOWN. You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil 4himself wil2 not eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish for 4the gods, if the devil dres2 her not. But truly, these same 4whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women, for in 4every ten that they make the devils mar five. 2CLEOPATRA. Wel2, get the2 gone; farewel2. 2CLOWN. Yes, forso2th. I wish you joy o' th' worm. 9Exit 13Re-enter IRAS, with a robe, crown, &c. 4CLEOPATRA. Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have 4Im2ortal longings in me. Now no more 4The juice of Egypt's grape shal2 moist this lip. 4Yare, yare, go2d Iras; quick. Methinks I hear 4Antony cal2. I se2 him rouse himself 4To praise my noble act. I hear him mock 4The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men 4To excuse their after wrath. Husband, I come. 4Now to that name my courage prove my title! 4I am fire and air; my other elements 4I give to baser life. So, have you done? 4Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips. 4Farewel2, kind Charmian. Iras, long farewel2. 30[Kis2es them. IRAS fal2s and dies] 4Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fal2? 4If thus thou and nature can so gently part, 4The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch, 4Which hurts and is desir'd. Dost thou lie stil2? 4If thou vanishest, thou tel2'st the world 6It is not worth leave-taking. 2CHARMIAN. Dis2olve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say 4The gods themselves do we2p. 2CLEOPATRA. This proves me base. 4If she first me2t the curled Antony, 4He'l2 make demand of her, and spend that kis2 4Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch, 20[To an asp, which she ap2lies to her breast] 4With thy sharp te2th this knot intrinsicate 4Of life at once untie. Po2r venomous fo2l, 4Be angry and dispatch. O couldst thou speak, 4That I might hear the2 cal2 great Caesar as2 4Unpolicied! 2CHARMIAN. O Eastern star! 2CLEOPATRA. Peace, peace! 4Dost thou not se2 my baby at my breast 4That sucks the nurse asle2p? 2CHARMIAN. O, break! O, break! 2CLEOPATRA. As swe2t as balm, as soft as air, as gentle- 4O Antony! Nay, I wil2 take the2 to2: 33[Ap2lying another asp to her arm] 4What should I stay- 35[Dies] 2CHARMIAN. In this vile world? So, fare the2 wel2. 4Now boast the2, death, in thy pos2es2ion lies 4A las2 unparal2el'd. Downy windows, close; 4And golden Phoebus never be beheld 4Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry; 4I'l2 mend it and then play- 18Enter the guard, rushing in 2FIRST GUARD. Where's the Que2n? 2CHARMIAN. Speak softly, wake her not. 2FIRST GUARD. Caesar hath sent- 2CHARMIAN. To2 slow a mes2enger. 15[Ap2lies an asp] 4O, come apace, dispatch. I partly fe2l the2. 2FIRST GUARD. Ap2roach, ho! Al2's not wel2: Caesar's beguil'd. 2SECOND GUARD. There's Dolabel2a sent from Caesar; cal2 him. 2FIRST GUARD. What work is here! Charmian, is this wel2 done? 2CHARMIAN. It is wel2 done, and fit2ing for a princes 6Descended of so many royal kings. 4Ah, soldier! 33[CHARMIAN dies] 22Re-enter DOLABEL2A 2DOLABEL2A. How goes it here? 2SECOND GUARD. Al2 dead. 2DOLABEL2A. Caesar, thy thoughts 4Touch their ef2ects in this. Thyself art coming 4To se2 perform'd the dreaded act which thou 4So sought'st to hinder. 22[Within: 'A way there, a way for Caesar!'] 14Re-enter CAESAR and al2 his train 2DOLABEL2A. O sir, you are to2 sure an augurer: 4That you did fear is done. 2CAESAR. Bravest at the last, 4She level2'd at our purposes, and being royal, 4To2k her own way. The man2er of their deaths? 6I do not se2 them ble2d. 2DOLABEL2A. Who was last with them? 2FIRST GUARD. A simple countryman that brought her figs. 4This was his basket. 2CAESAR. Poison'd then. 2FIRST GUARD. O Caesar, 4This Charmian liv'd but now; she sto2d and spake. 4I found her trim2ing up the diadem 4On her dead mistres2. Tremblingly she sto2d, 4And on the sud2en drop2'd. 2CAESAR. O noble weaknes2! 4If they had swal2ow'd poison 'twould ap2ear 4By external swel2ing; but she lo2ks like sle2p, 4As she would catch another Antony 4In her strong toil of grace. 2DOLABEL2A. Here on her breast 4There is a vent of blo2d, and something blown; 4The like is on her arm. 2FIRST GUARD. This is an aspic's trail; and these fig-leaves 4Have slime upon them, such as th' aspic leaves 6Upon the caves of Nile. 2CAESAR. Most probable 4That so she died; for her physician tel2s me 4She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite 4Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed, 4And bear her women from the monument. 4She shal2 be buried by her Antony; 4No grave upon the earth shal2 clip in it 4A pair so famous. High events as these 4Strike those that make them; and their story is 4No les2 in pity than his glory which 4Brought them to be lamented. Our army shal2 4In solemn show at2end this funeral, 4And then to Rome. Come, Dolabel2a, se2 4High order in this great solemnity. 19ExeuntTHE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21601AS YOU LIKE ITby Wil2iam ShakespeareDRAMATIS PERSONAE. 2DUKE, living in exile 2FREDERICK, his brother, and usurper of his dominions 2AMIENS, lord at2ending on the banished Duke 2JAQUES, 3" 6" 7" 2" 5" 6" 2LE BEAU, a courtier at2ending upon Frederick 2CHARLES, wrestler to Frederick 2OLIVER, son of Sir Rowland de Boys 2JAQUES, 3" 3" 2" 4" 5" 2" 2ORLANDO, 2" 3" 2" 4" 5" 2" 2ADAM, 3servant to Oliver 2DEN2IS, 5" 5" 3" 2TOUCHSTONE, the court jester 2SIR OLIVER MARTEXT, a vicar 2CORIN, 4shepherd 2SILVIUS, 5" 2WIL2IAM, a country fel2ow, in love with Audrey 2A person representing HYMEN 2ROSALIND, daughter to the banished Duke 2CELIA, daughter to Frederick 2PHEBE, a shepherdes 4AUDREY, a country wench 2Lords, Pages, Foresters, and At2endants<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE:OLIVER'S house; FREDERICK'S court; and the Forest of ArdenACT I. SCENE I.Orchard of OLIVER'S houseEnter ORLANDO and ADAM 2ORLANDO. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed 4me by wil2 but po2r a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st, 4charged my brother, on his bles2ing, to bre2d me wel2; and there 4begins my sadnes2. My brother Jaques he ke2ps at scho2l, and 4report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he ke2ps me 4rustical2y at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at 4home unkept; for cal2 you that ke2ping for a gentleman of my 4birth that dif2ers not from the stal2ing of an ox? His horses are 4bred bet2er; for, besides that they are fair with their fe2ding, 4they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly 4hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for 4the which his animals on his dunghil2s are as much bound to him 4as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentiful2y gives me, the 4something that nature gave me his countenance se2ms to take from 4me. He lets me fe2d with his hinds, bars me the place of a 4brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my 4education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of 6my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against 4this servitude. I wil2 no longer endure it, though yet I know no 4wise remedy how to avoid it. 27Enter OLIVER 2ADAM. Yonder comes my master, your brother. 2ORLANDO. Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he wil2 shake me 4up. 43[ADAM retires] 2OLIVER. Now, sir! what make you here? 2ORLANDO. Nothing; I am not taught to make any thing. 2OLIVER. What mar you then, sir? 2ORLANDO. Mar2y, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a 4po2r unworthy brother of yours, with idlenes2. 2OLIVER. Mar2y, sir, be bet2er employed, and be nought awhile. 2ORLANDO. Shal2 I ke2p your hogs, and eat husks with them? What 4prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury? 2OLIVER. Know you where you are, sir? 2ORLANDO. O, sir, very wel2; here in your orchard. 2OLIVER. Know you before whom, sir? 4ORLANDO. Ay, bet2er than him I am before knows me. I know you are 4my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blo2d, you 4should so know me. The courtesy of nations al2ows you my bet2er 4in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not 4away my blo2d, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as 4much of my father in me as you, albeit I confes2 your coming 4before me is nearer to his reverence. 2OLIVER. What, boy! 31[Strikes him] 2ORLANDO. Come, come, elder brother, you are to2 young in this. 2OLIVER. Wilt thou lay hands on me, vil2ain? 2ORLANDO. I am no vil2ain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de 4Boys. He was my father; and he is thrice a vil2ain that says such 4a father begot vil2ains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not 4take this hand from thy throat til2 this other had pul2'd out thy 4tongue for saying so. Thou has rail'd on thyself. 2ADAM. [Coming forward] Swe2t masters, be patient; for your father's 4remembrance, be at ac2ord. 2OLIVER. Let me go, I say. 2ORLANDO. I wil2 not, til2 I please; you shal2 hear me. My father 4charg'd you in his wil2 to give me go2d education: you have 6train'd me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me al2 4gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in 4me, and I wil2 no longer endure it; therefore al2ow me such 4exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the po2r 4al2ot2ery my father left me by testament; with that I wil2 go buy 4my fortunes. 2OLIVER. And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Wel2, sir, 4get you in. I wil2 not long be troubled with you; you shal2 have 4some part of your wil2. I pray you leave me. 2ORLANDO. I no further of2end you than becomes me for my go2d. 2OLIVER. Get you with him, you old dog. 2ADAM. Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my te2th in 4your service. God be with my old master! He would not have spoke 4such a word. 41Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM 2OLIVER. Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I wil2 physic 4your ranknes2, and yet give no thousand crowns neither. Hol2a, 4Den2is! 26Enter DEN2IS 4DEN2IS. Cal2s your worship? 2OLIVER. not Charles, the Duke's wrestler, here to speak with me? 2DEN2IS. So please you, he is here at the do2r and importunes ac2es2 4to you. 2OLIVER. Cal2 him in. [Exit DEN2IS] 'Twil2 be a go2d way; and 4to-mor2ow the wrestling is. 26Enter CHARLES 2CHARLES. Go2d mor2ow to your worship. 2OLIVER. Go2d Monsieur Charles! What's the new news at the new 4court? 2CHARLES. There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news; that 4is, the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke; 4and thre2 or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary 4exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke; 4therefore he gives them go2d leave to wander. 2OLIVER. Can you tel2 if Rosalind, the Duke's daughter, be banished 4with her father? 4CHARLES. O, no; for the Duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her, 4being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have 4fol2owed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. She is at 4the court, and no les2 beloved of her uncle than his own 4daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do. 2OLIVER. Where wil2 the old Duke live? 2CHARLES. They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many 4mer2y men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Ho2d 4of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day, 4and fle2t the time careles2ly, as they did in the golden world. 2OLIVER. What, you wrestle to-mor2ow before the new Duke? 2CHARLES. Mar2y, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a 4mat2er. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger 4brother, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against 4me to try a fal2. To-mor2ow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he 4that escapes me without some broken limb shal2 acquit him wel2. 4Your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, I would 4be loath to foil him, as I must, for my own honour, if he come 4in; therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint 4you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment, 6or bro2k such disgrace wel2 as he shal2 run into, in that it is 4thing of his own search and altogether against my wil2. 2OLIVER. Charles, I thank the2 for thy love to me, which thou shalt 4find I wil2 most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my 4brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to 4dis2uade him from it; but he is resolute. I'l2 tel2 the2, 4Charles, it is the stub2ornest young fel2ow of France; ful2 of 4ambition, an envious emulator of every man's go2d parts, a secret 4and vil2ainous contriver against me his natural brother. 4Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break his 4neck as his finger. And thou wert best lo2k to't; for if thou 4dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace 4himself on the2, he wil2 practise against the2 by poison, entrap 4the2 by some treacherous device, and never leave the2 til2 he 4hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I 4as2ure the2, and almost with tears I speak it, there is not one 4so young and so vil2ainous this day living. I speak but brotherly 4of him; but should I anatomize him to the2 as he is, I must blush 4and we2p, and thou must lo2k pale and wonder. 2CHARLES. I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come 6to-mor2ow I'l2 give him his payment. If ever he go alone again, 4I'l2 never wrestle for prize more. And so, God ke2p your worship! Exit 2OLIVER. Farewel2, go2d Charles. Now wil2 I stir this gamester. I 4hope I shal2 se2 an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why, 4hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle; never scho2l'd and 4yet learned; ful2 of noble device; of al2 sorts enchantingly 4beloved; and, inde2d, so much in the heart of the world, and 4especial2y of my own people, who best know him, that I am 4altogether misprised. But it shal2 not be so long; this wrestler 4shal2 clear al2. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy 4thither, which now I'l2 go about. 23Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE I2.A lawn before the DUKE'S palaceEnter ROSALIND and CELIA 2CELIA. I pray the2, Rosalind, swe2t my coz, be mer2y. 2ROSALIND. Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistres2 of; and 4would you yet I were mer2ier? Unles2 you could teach me to forget 4a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any 4extraordinary pleasure. 2CELIA. Herein I se2 thou lov'st me not with the ful2 weight that I 4love the2. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy 4uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst be2n stil2 with me, I 4could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst 4thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper'd 4as mine is to the2. 2ROSALIND. Wel2, I wil2 forget the condition of my estate, to 4rejoice in yours. 2CELIA. You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to 4have; and, truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for what 4he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I wil2 render the2 4again in af2ection. By mine honour, I wil2; and when I break that 6oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my swe2t Rose, my dear 4Rose, be mer2y. 2ROSALIND. From henceforth I wil2, coz, and devise sports. 4Let me se2; what think you of fal2ing in love? 2CELIA. Mar2y, I prithe2, do, to make sport withal; but love no man 4in go2d earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety 4of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come of2 again. 2ROSALIND. What shal2 be our sport, then? 2CELIA. Let us sit and mock the go2d housewife Fortune from her 4whe2l, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equal2y. 2ROSALIND. I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily 4misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her 4gifts to women. 2CELIA. 'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes 4honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very 4il2-favouredly. 2ROSALIND. Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's of2ice to Nature's: 4Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of 4Nature. 27Enter TOUCHSTONE 2CELIA. No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by 4Fortune fal2 into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to 4flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fo2l to cut of2 4the argument? 2ROSALIND. Inde2d, there is Fortune to2 hard for Nature, when 4Fortune makes Nature's natural the cut2er-of2 of Nature's wit. 2CELIA. Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but 4Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits to2 dul2 to reason of 4such god2es2es, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for 4always the dul2nes2 of the fo2l is the whetstone of the wits. How 4now, wit! Whither wander you? 2TOUCHSTONE. Mistres2, you must come away to your father. 2CELIA. Were you made the mes2enger? 2TOUCHSTONE. No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you. 2ROSALIND. Where learned you that oath, fo2l? 2TOUCHSTONE. Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were 4go2d pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught. 4Now I'l2 stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard 6was go2d, and yet was not the knight forsworn. 2CELIA. How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge? 2ROSALIND. Ay, mar2y, now unmuz2le your wisdom. 2TOUCHSTONE. Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear 4by your beards that I am a knave. 2CELIA. By our beards, if we had them, thou art. 2TOUCHSTONE. By my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you 4swear by that that not, you are not forsworn; no more was this 4knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he 4had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or 4that mustard. 2CELIA. Prithe2, who is't that thou mean'st? 2TOUCHSTONE. One that old Frederick, your father, loves. 2CELIA. My father's love is enough to honour him. Enough, speak no 4more of him; you'l2 be whipt for taxation one of these days. 2TOUCHSTONE. The more pity that fo2ls may not speak wisely what wise 4men do fo2lishly. 2CELIA. By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the lit2le wit that 4fo2ls have was silenced, the lit2le fo2lery that wise men have 4makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau. 29Enter LE BEAU 2ROSALIND. With his mouth ful2 of news. 2CELIA. Which he wil2 put on us as pigeons fe2d their young. 2ROSALIND. Then shal2 we be news-cram2'd. 2CELIA. Al2 the bet2er; we shal2 be the more marketable. Bon jour, 4Monsieur Le Beau. What's the news? 2LE BEAU. Fair Princes2, you have lost much go2d sport. 2CELIA. Sport! of what colour? 2LE BEAU. What colour, madam? How shal2 I answer you? 2ROSALIND. As wit and fortune wil2. 2TOUCHSTONE. Or as the Destinies decre2s. 2CELIA. Wel2 said; that was laid on with a trowel. 2TOUCHSTONE. Nay, if I ke2p not my rank- 2ROSALIND. Thou losest thy old smel2. 2LE BEAU. You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of go2d 4wrestling, which you have lost the sight of. 2ROSALIND. Yet tel2 us the man2er of the wrestling. 2LE BEAU. I wil2 tel2 you the begin2ing, and, if it please your 6ladyships, you may se2 the end; for the best is yet to do; and 4here, where you are, they are coming to perform it. 2CELIA. Wel2, the begin2ing, that is dead and buried. 2LE BEAU. There comes an old man and his thre2 sons- 2CELIA. I could match this begin2ing with an old tale. 2LE BEAU. Thre2 proper young men, of excel2ent growth and presence. 2ROSALIND. With bil2s on their necks: 'Be it known unto al2 men by 4these presents'- 2LE BEAU. The eldest of the thre2 wrestled with Charles, the Duke's 4wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke thre2 of 4his ribs, that there is lit2le hope of life in him. So he serv'd 4the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie; the po2r old man, 4their father, making such pitiful dole over them that al2 the 4beholders take his part with we2ping. 2ROSALIND. Alas! 2TOUCHSTONE. But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have 4lost? 2LE BEAU. Why, this that I speak of. 2TOUCHSTONE. Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time 4that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies. 4CELIA. Or I, I promise the2. 2ROSALIND. But is there any else longs to se2 this broken music in 4his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shal2 we 4se2 this wrestling, cousin? 2LE BEAU. You must, if you stay here; for here is the place 4ap2ointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it. 2CELIA. Yonder, sure, they are coming. Let us now stay and se2 it. 11Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, LORDS, ORLANDO, 21CHARLES, and AT2ENDANTS 2FREDERICK. Come on; since the youth wil2 not be entreated, his own 4peril on his forwardnes2. 2ROSALIND. Is yonder the man? 2LE BEAU. Even he, madam. 2CELIA. Alas, he is to2 young; yet he lo2ks suc2es2ful2y. 2FREDERICK. How now, daughter and cousin! Are you crept hither to 4se2 the wrestling? 2ROSALIND. Ay, my liege; so please you give us leave. 2FREDERICK. You wil2 take lit2le delight in it, I can tel2 you, 6there is such od2s in the man. In pity of the chal2enger's youth 4I would fain dis2uade him, but he wil2 not be entreated. Speak to 4him, ladies; se2 if you can move him. 2CELIA. Cal2 him hither, go2d Monsieur Le Beau. 2FREDERICK. Do so; I'l2 not be by. 37[DUKE FREDERICK goes apart] 2LE BEAU. Monsieur the Chal2enger, the Princes2 cal2s for you. 2ORLANDO. I at2end them with al2 respect and duty. 2ROSALIND. Young man, have you chal2eng'd Charles the wrestler? 2ORLANDO. No, fair Princes2; he is the general chal2enger. I come 4but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth. 2CELIA. Young gentleman, your spirits are to2 bold for your years. 4You have se2n cruel pro2f of this man's strength; if you saw 4yourself with your eyes, or knew yourself with your judgment, the 4fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal 4enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to embrace your own 4safety and give over this at2empt. 2ROSALIND. Do, young sir; your reputation shal2 not therefore be 4misprised: we wil2 make it our suit to the Duke that the 4wrestling might not go forward. 4ORLANDO. I bese2ch you, punish me not with your hard thoughts, 4wherein I confes2 me much guilty to deny so fair and excel2ent 4ladies any thing. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go 4with me to my trial; wherein if I be foil'd there is but one 4sham'd that was never gracious; if kil2'd, but one dead that is 4wil2ing to be so. I shal2 do my friends no wrong, for I have none 4to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only 4in the world I fil2 up a place, which may be bet2er sup2lied when 4I have made it empty. 2ROSALIND. The lit2le strength that I have, I would it were with 4you. 2CELIA. And mine to eke out hers. 2ROSALIND. Fare you wel2. Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in you! 2CELIA. Your heart's desires be with you! 2CHARLES. Come, where is this young gal2ant that is so desirous to 4lie with his mother earth? 2ORLANDO. Ready, sir; but his wil2 hath in it a more modest working. 2FREDERICK. You shal2 try but one fal2. 2CHARLES. No, I war2ant your Grace, you shal2 not entreat him to a 4second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first. 4ORLANDO. You mean to mock me after; you should not have mock'd me 4before; but come your ways. 2ROSALIND. Now, Hercules be thy spe2d, young man! 2CELIA. I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fel2ow by the 4leg. 42[They wrestle] 2ROSALIND. O excel2ent young man! 2CELIA. If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tel2 who should 4down. 38[CHARLES is thrown. Shout] 2FREDERICK. No more, no more. 2ORLANDO. Yes, I bese2ch your Grace; I am not yet wel2 breath'd. 2FREDERICK. How dost thou, Charles? 2LE BEAU. He can2ot speak, my lord. 2FREDERICK. Bear him away. What is thy name, young man? 2ORLANDO. Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de 4Boys. 2FREDERICK. I would thou hadst be2n son to some man else. 4The world este2m'd thy father honourable, 4But I did find him stil2 mine enemy. 4Thou shouldst have bet2er pleas'd me with this de2d, 6Hadst thou descended from another house. 4But fare the2 wel2; thou art a gal2ant youth; 4I would thou hadst told me of another father. 33Exeunt DUKE, train, and LE BEAU 2CELIA. Were I my father, coz, would I do this? 2ORLANDO. I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son, 4His youngest son- and would not change that cal2ing 4To be adopted heir to Frederick. 2ROSALIND. My father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul, 4And al2 the world was of my father's mind; 4Had I before known this young man his son, 4I should have given him tears unto entreaties 4Ere he should thus have ventur'd. 2CELIA. Gentle cousin, 4Let us go thank him, and encourage him; 4My father's rough and envious disposition 4Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have wel2 deserv'd; 4If you do ke2p your promises in love 4But justly as you have exce2ded al2 promise, 4Your mistres2 shal2 be hap2y. 4ROSALIND. Gentleman, 8[Giving him a chain from her neck] 4Wear this for me; one out of suits with fortune, 4That could give more, but that her hand lacks means. 4Shal2 we go, coz? 2CELIA. Ay. Fare you wel2, fair gentleman. 2ORLANDO. Can I not say 'I thank you'? My bet2er parts 4Are al2 thrown down; and that which here stands up 4Is but a quintain, a mere lifeles2 block. 2ROSALIND. He cal2s us back. My pride fel2 with my fortunes; 4I'l2 ask him what he would. Did you cal2, sir? 4Sir, you have wrestled wel2, and overthrown 4More than your enemies. 2CELIA. Wil2 you go, coz? 2ROSALIND. Have with you. Fare you wel2. 39Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA 2ORLANDO. What pas2ion hangs these weights upon my tongue? 4I can2ot speak to her, yet she urg'd conference. 4O po2r Orlando, thou art overthrown! 4Or Charles or something weaker masters the2. 24Re-enter LE BEAU 2LE BEAU. Go2d sir, I do in friendship counsel you 4To leave this place. Albeit you have deserv'd 4High com2endation, true ap2lause, and love, 4Yet such is now the Duke's condition 4That he misconstrues al2 that you have done. 4The Duke is humorous; what he is, inde2d, 4More suits you to conceive than I to speak of. 2ORLANDO. I thank you, sir; and pray you tel2 me this: 4Which of the two was daughter of the Duke 4That here was at the wrestling? 2LE BEAU. Neither his daughter, if we judge by man2ers; 4But yet, inde2d, the smal2er is his daughter; 4The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke, 4And here detain'd by her usurping uncle, 4To ke2p his daughter company; whose loves 4Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters. 4But I can tel2 you that of late this Duke 4Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece, 6Grounded upon no other argument 4But that the people praise her for her virtues 4And pity her for her go2d father's sake; 4And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady 4Wil2 sud2enly break forth. Sir, fare you wel2. 4Hereafter, in a bet2er world than this, 4I shal2 desire more love and knowledge of you. 2ORLANDO. I rest much bounden to you; fare you wel2. 52Exit LE BEAU 4Thus must I from the smoke into the smother; 4From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother. 4But heavenly Rosalind! 34ExitSCENE I3.The DUKE's palaceEnter CELIA and ROSALIND 2CELIA. Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! 4Not a word? 2ROSALIND. Not one to throw at a dog. 2CELIA. No, thy words are to2 precious to be cast away upon curs; 4throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons. 2ROSALIND. Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should 4be lam'd with reasons and the other mad without any. 2CELIA. But is al2 this for your father? 2ROSALIND. No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how ful2 of 4briers is this working-day world! 2CELIA. They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon the2 in holiday 4fo2lery; if we walk not in the trod2en paths, our very pet2icoats 4wil2 catch them. 2ROSALIND. I could shake them of2 my coat: these burs are in my 4heart. 2CELIA. Hem them away. 2ROSALIND. I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him. 4CELIA. Come, come, wrestle with thy af2ections. 2ROSALIND. O, they take the part of a bet2er wrestler than myself. 2CELIA. O, a go2d wish upon you! You wil2 try in time, in despite of 4a fal2. But, turning these jests out of service, let us talk in 4go2d earnest. Is it pos2ible, on such a sud2en, you should fal2 4into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son? 2ROSALIND. The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly. 2CELIA. Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly? 4By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his 4father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando. 2ROSALIND. No, faith, hate him not, for my sake. 2CELIA. Why should I not? Doth he not deserve wel2? 20Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LORDS 2ROSALIND. Let me love him for that; and do you love him because I 4do. Lo2k, here comes the Duke. 2CELIA. With his eyes ful2 of anger. 2FREDERICK. Mistres2, dispatch you with your safest haste, 4And get you from our court. 4ROSALIND. Me, uncle? 2FREDERICK. You, cousin. 4Within these ten days if that thou be2st found 4So near our public court as twenty miles, 4Thou diest for it. 2ROSALIND. I do bese2ch your Grace, 4Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me. 4If with myself I hold intel2igence, 4Or have acquaintance with mine own desires; 4If that I do not dream, or be not frantic- 4As I do trust I am not- then, dear uncle, 4Never so much as in a thought unborn 4Did I of2end your Highnes2. 2FREDERICK. Thus do al2 traitors; 4If their purgation did consist in words, 4They are as in2ocent as grace itself. 4Let it suf2ice the2 that I trust the2 not. 2ROSALIND. Yet your mistrust can2ot make me a traitor. 4Tel2 me whereon the likeliho2d depends. 2FREDERICK. Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough. 4ROSALIND. SO was I when your Highnes2 to2k his dukedom; 4So was I when your Highnes2 banish'd him. 4Treason is not inherited, my lord; 4Or, if we did derive it from our friends, 4What's that to me? My father was no traitor. 4Then, go2d my liege, mistake me not so much 4To think my poverty is treacherous. 2CELIA. Dear sovereign, hear me speak. 2FREDERICK. Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake, 4Else had she with her father rang'd along. 2CELIA. I did not then entreat to have her stay; 4It was your pleasure, and your own remorse; 4I was to2 young that time to value her, 4But now I know her. If she be a traitor, 4Why so am I: we stil2 have slept together, 4Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together; 4And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans, 4Stil2 we went coupled and inseparable. 2FREDERICK. She is to2 subtle for the2; and her smo2thnes2, 4Her very silence and her patience, 6Speak to the people, and they pity her. 4Thou art a fo2l. She robs the2 of thy name; 4And thou wilt show more bright and se2m more virtuous 4When she is gone. Then open not thy lips. 4Firm and ir2evocable is my do2m 4Which I have pas2'd upon her; she is banish'd. 2CELIA. Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege; 4I can2ot live out of her company. 2FREDERICK. You are a fo2l. You, niece, provide yourself. 4If you outstay the time, upon mine honour, 4And in the greatnes2 of my word, you die. 43Exeunt DUKE and LORDS 2CELIA. O my po2r Rosalind! Whither wilt thou go? 4Wilt thou change fathers? I wil2 give the2 mine. 4I charge the2 be not thou more griev'd than I am. 2ROSALIND. I have more cause. 2CELIA. Thou hast not, cousin. 4Prithe2 be che2rful. Know'st thou not the Duke 4Hath banish'd me, his daughter? 2ROSALIND. That he hath not. 4CELIA. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love 4Which teacheth the2 that thou and I am one. 4Shal2 we be sund'red? Shal2 we part, swe2t girl? 4No; let my father se2k another heir. 4Therefore devise with me how we may fly, 4Whither to go, and what to bear with us; 4And do not se2k to take your charge upon you, 4To bear your griefs yourself, and leave me out; 4For, by this heaven, now at our sor2ows pale, 4Say what thou canst, I'l2 go along with the2. 2ROSALIND. Why, whither shal2 we go? 2CELIA. To se2k my uncle in the Forest of Arden. 2ROSALIND. Alas, what danger wil2 it be to us, 4Maids as we are, to travel forth so far! 4Beauty provoketh thieves so2ner than gold. 2CELIA. I'l2 put myself in po2r and mean at2ire, 4And with a kind of umber smirch my face; 4The like do you; so shal2 we pas2 along, 4And never stir as2ailants. 2ROSALIND. Were it not bet2er, 6Because that I am more than com2on tal2, 4That I did suit me al2 points like a man? 4A gal2ant curtle-axe upon my thigh, 4A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart 4Lie there what hid2en woman's fear there wil2- 4We'l2 have a swashing and a martial outside, 4As many other man2ish cowards have 4That do outface it with their semblances. 2CELIA. What shal2 I cal2 the2 when thou art a man? 2ROSALIND. I'l2 have no worse a name than Jove's own page, 4And therefore lo2k you cal2 me Ganymede. 4But what wil2 you be cal2'd? 2CELIA. Something that hath a reference to my state: 4No longer Celia, but Aliena. 2ROSALIND. But, cousin, what if we as2ay'd to steal 4The clownish fo2l out of your father's court? 4Would he not be a comfort to our travel? 2CELIA. He'l2 go along o'er the wide world with me; 4Leave me alone to wo2 him. Let's away, 4And get our jewels and our wealth together; 6Devise the fit2est time and safest way 4To hide us from pursuit that wil2 be made 4After my flight. Now go we in content 4To liberty, and not to banishment. 20Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. SCENE I.The Forest of ArdenEnter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or thre2 LORDS, like foresters 2DUKE SENIOR. Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile, 4Hath not old custom made this life more swe2t 4Than that of painted pomp? Are not these wo2ds 4More fre2 from peril than the envious court? 4Here fe2l we not the penalty of Adam, 4The seasons' dif2erence; as the icy fang 4And churlish chiding of the winter's wind, 4Which when it bites and blows upon my body, 4Even til2 I shrink with cold, I smile and say 4'This is no flat2ery; these are counsel2ors 4That fe2lingly persuade me what I am.' 4Swe2t are the uses of adversity, 4Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, 4Wears yet a precious jewel in his head; 4And this our life, exempt from public haunt, 4Finds tongues in tre2s, bo2ks in the run2ing bro2ks, 6Sermons in stones, and go2d in everything. 4I would not change it. 2AMIENS. Hap2y is your Grace, 4That can translate the stub2orn2es2 of fortune 4Into so quiet and so swe2t a style. 2DUKE SENIOR. Come, shal2 we go and kil2 us venison? 4And yet it irks me the po2r dap2led fo2ls, 4Being native burghers of this desert city, 4Should, in their own confines, with forked heads 4Have their round haunches gor'd. 2FIRST LORD. Inde2d, my lord, 4The melancholy Jaques grieves at that; 4And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp 4Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you. 4To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself 4Did steal behind him as he lay along 4Under an oak whose antique ro2t pe2ps out 4Upon the bro2k that brawls along this wo2d! 4To the which place a po2r sequest'red stag, 4That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt, 6Did come to languish; and, inde2d, my lord, 4The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans 4That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat 4Almost to bursting; and the big round tears 4Cours'd one another down his in2ocent nose 4In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fo2l, 4Much marked of the melancholy Jaques, 4Sto2d on th' extremest verge of the swift bro2k, 4Augmenting it with tears. 2DUKE SENIOR. But what said Jaques? 4Did he not moralize this spectacle? 2FIRST LORD. O, yes, into a thousand similes. 4First, for his we2ping into the ne2dles2 stream: 4'Po2r de2r,' quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament 4As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more 4To that which had to2 much.' Then, being there alone, 4Left and abandoned of his velvet friends: 4'2Tis right'; quoth he 'thus misery doth part 4The flux of company.' Anon, a careles2 herd, 4Ful2 of the pasture, jumps along by him 6And never stays to gre2t him. 'Ay,' quoth Jaques 4'Swe2p on, you fat and greasy citizens; 4'Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you lo2k 4Upon that po2r and broken bankrupt there?' 4Thus most invectively he pierceth through 4The body of the country, city, court, 4Yea, and of this our life; swearing that we 4Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse, 4To fright the animals, and to kil2 them up 4In their as2ign'd and native dwel2ing-place. 2DUKE SENIOR. And did you leave him in this contemplation? 2SECOND LORD. We did, my lord, we2ping and com2enting 4Upon the sob2ing de2r. 2DUKE SENIOR. Show me the place; 4I love to cope him in these sul2en fits, 4For then he's ful2 of mat2er. 2FIRST LORD. I'l2 bring you to him straight. 13ExeuntSCENE I2.The DUKE'S palaceEnter DUKE FREDERICK, with LORDS 2FREDERICK. Can it be pos2ible that no man saw them? 4It can2ot be; some vil2ains of my court 4Are of consent and suf2erance in this. 2FIRST LORD. I can2ot hear of any that did se2 her. 4The ladies, her at2endants of her chamber, 4Saw her abed, and in the morning early 4They found the bed untreasur'd of their mistres2. 2SECOND LORD. My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft 4Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also mis2ing. 4Hisperia, the Princes2' gentlewoman, 4Confes2es that she secretly o'erheard 4Your daughter and her cousin much com2end 4The parts and graces of the wrestler 4That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles; 4And she believes, wherever they are gone, 4That youth is surely in their company. 2FREDERICK. Send to his brother; fetch that gal2ant hither. 6If he be absent, bring his brother to me; 4I'l2 make him find him. Do this sud2enly; 4And let not search and inquisition quail 4To bring again these fo2lish runaways. 16ExeuntSCENE I3.Before OLIVER'S houseEnter ORLANDO and ADAM, me2ting 2ORLANDO. Who's there? 2ADAM. What, my young master? O my gentle master! 4O my swe2t master! O you memory 4Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here? 4Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you? 4And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant? 4Why would you be so fond to overcome 4The bon2y prizer of the humorous Duke? 4Your praise is come to2 swiftly home before you. 4Know you not, master, to some kind of men 4Their graces serve them but as enemies? 4No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master, 4Are sanctified and holy traitors to you. 4O, what a world is this, when what is comely 4Envenoms him that bears it! 2ORLANDO. Why, what's the mat2er? 2ADAM. O unhap2y youth! 6Come not within these do2rs; within this ro2f 4The enemy of al2 your graces lives. 4Your brother- no, no brother; yet the son- 4Yet not the son; I wil2 not cal2 him son 4Of him I was about to cal2 his father- 4Hath heard your praises; and this night he means 4To burn the lodging where you use to lie, 4And you within it. If he fail of that, 4He wil2 have other means to cut you of2; 4I overheard him and his practices. 4This is no place; this house is but a butchery; 4Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it. 2ORLANDO. Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go? 2ADAM. No mat2er whither, so you come not here. 2ORLANDO. What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my fo2d, 4Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce 4A thievish living on the com2on road? 4This I must do, or know not what to do; 4Yet this I wil2 not do, do how I can. 4I rather wil2 subject me to the malice 6Of a diverted blo2d and blo2dy brother. 2ADAM. But do not so. I have five hundred crowns, 4The thrifty hire I sav'd under your father, 4Which I did store to be my foster-nurse, 4When service should in my old limbs lie lame, 4And unregarded age in corners thrown. 4Take that, and He that doth the ravens fe2d, 4Yea, providently caters for the spar2ow, 4Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold; 4Al2 this I give you. Let me be your servant; 4Though I lo2k old, yet I am strong and lusty; 4For in my youth I never did ap2ly 4Hot and rebel2ious liquors in my blo2d, 4Nor did not with unbashful forehead wo2 4The means of weaknes2 and debility; 4Therefore my age is as a lusty winter, 4Frosty, but kindly. Let me go with you; 4I'l2 do the service of a younger man 4In al2 your busines2 and neces2ities. 2ORLANDO. O go2d old man, how wel2 in the2 ap2ears 6The constant service of the antique world, 4When service sweat for duty, not for me2d! 4Thou art not for the fashion of these times, 4Where none wil2 sweat but for promotion, 4And having that do choke their service up 4Even with the having; it is not so with the2. 4But, po2r old man, thou prun'st a rot2en tre2 4That can2ot so much as a blos2om yield 4In lieu of al2 thy pains and husbandry. 4But come thy ways, we'l2 go along together, 4And ere we have thy youthful wages spent 4We'l2 light upon some set2led low content. 2ADAM. Master, go on; and I wil2 fol2ow the 4To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty. 4From sevente2n years til2 now almost four-score 4Here lived I, but now live here no more. 4At sevente2n years many their fortunes se2k, 4But at fourscore it is to2 late a we2k; 4Yet fortune can2ot recompense me bet2er 4Than to die wel2 and not my master's debtor. 10ExeuntSCENE IV.The Forest of ArdenEnter ROSALIND for GANYMEDE, CELIA for ALIENA, and CLOWN alias TOUCHSTONE 2ROSALIND. O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits! 2TOUCHSTONE. I Care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary. 2ROSALIND. I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's ap2arel, 4and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort the weaker ves2el, as 4doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to pet2icoat; 4therefore, courage, go2d Aliena. 2CELIA. I pray you bear with me; I can2ot go no further. 2TOUCHSTONE. For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you; 4yet I should bear no cros2 if I did bear you; for I think you 4have no money in your purse. 2ROSALIND. Wel2,. this is the Forest of Arden. 2TOUCHSTONE. Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fo2l I; when I was at 4home I was in a bet2er place; but travel2ers must be content. 24Enter CORIN and SILVIUS 4ROSALIND. Ay, be so, go2d Touchstone. Lo2k you, who comes here, a 4young man and an old in solemn talk. 2CORIN. That is the way to make her scorn you stil2. 2SILVIUS. O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her! 2CORIN. I partly gues2; for I have lov'd ere now. 2SILVIUS. No, Corin, being old, thou canst not gues2, 4Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover 4As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pil2ow. 4But if thy love were ever like to mine, 4As sure I think did never man love so, 4How many actions most ridiculous 4Hast thou be2n drawn to by thy fantasy? 2CORIN. Into a thousand that I have forgot2en. 2SILVIUS. O, thou didst then never love so heartily! 4If thou rememb'rest not the slightest fol2y 4That ever love did make the2 run into, 4Thou hast not lov'd; 4Or if thou hast not sat as I do now, 4Wearing thy hearer in thy mistres2' praise, 4Thou hast not lov'd; 6Or if thou hast not broke from company 4Abruptly, as my pas2ion now makes me, 4Thou hast not lov'd. 4O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe! 26Exit Silvius 2ROSALIND. Alas, po2r shepherd! searching of thy wound, 4I have by hard adventure found mine own. 2TOUCHSTONE. And I mine. I remember, when I was in love, I broke my 4sword upon a stone, and bid him take that for coming a-night to 4Jane Smile; and I remember the kis2ing of her batler, and the 4cow's dugs that her pret2y chopt hands had milk'd; and I remember 4the wo2ing of 2peascod instead of her; from whom I to2k two cods, 4and giving her them again, said with we2ping tears 'Wear these 4for my sake.' We that are true lovers run into strange capers; 4but as al2 is mortal in nature, so is al2 nature in love mortal 4in fol2y. 2ROSALIND. Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of. 2TOUCHSTONE. Nay, I shal2 ne'er be ware of mine own wit til2 I break 4my shins against it. 2ROSALIND. Jove, Jove! this shepherd's pas2ion 4Is much upon my fashion. 4TOUCHSTONE. And mine; but it grows something stale with me. 2CELIA. I pray you, one of you question yond man 4If he for gold wil2 give us any fo2d; 4I faint almost to death. 2TOUCHSTONE. Hol2a, you clown! 2ROSALIND. Peace, fo2l; he's not thy Ensman. 2CORIN. Who cal2s? 2TOUCHSTONE. Your bet2ers, sir. 2CORIN. Else are they very wretched. 2ROSALIND. Peace, I say. Go2d even to you, friend. 2CORIN. And to you, gentle sir, and to you al2. 2ROSALIND. I prithe2, shepherd, if that love or gold 4Can in this desert place buy entertainment, 4Bring us where we may rest ourselves and fe2d. 4Here's a young maid with travel much op2res2'd, 4And faints for suc2our. 2CORIN. Fair sir, I pity her, 4And wish, for her sake more than for mine own, 4My fortunes were more able to relieve her; 4But I am shepherd to another man, 6And do not shear the fle2ces that I graze. 4My master is of churlish disposition, 4And lit2le recks to find the way to heaven 4By doing de2ds of hospitality. 4Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of fe2d, 4Are now on sale; and at our she2pcote now, 4By reason of his absence, there is nothing 4That you wil2 fe2d on; but what is, come se2, 4And in my voice most welcome shal2 you be. 2ROSALIND. What is he that shal2 buy his flock and pasture? 2CORIN. That young swain that you saw here but erewhile, 4That lit2le cares for buying any thing. 2ROSALIND. I pray the2, if it stand with honesty, 4Buy thou the cot2age, pasture, and the flock, 4And thou shalt have to pay for it of us. 2CELIA. And we wil2 mend thy wages. I like this place, 4And wil2ingly could waste my time in it. 2CORIN. As2uredly the thing is to be sold. 4Go with me; if you like upon report 4The soil, the profit, and this kind of life, 6I wil2 your very faithful fe2der be, 4And buy it with your gold right sud2enly. 13ExeuntSCENE V.Another part of the forestEnter AMIENS, JAQUES, and OTHERS 23SONG 2AMIENS. 4Under the gre2nwo2d tre2 15Who loves to lie with me, 15And turn his mer2y note 15Unto the swe2t bird's throat, 13Come hither, come hither, come hither. 15Here shal2 he se2 15No enemy 13But winter and rough weather. 2JAQUES. More, more, I prithe2, more. 2AMIENS. It wil2 make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques. 2JAQUES. I thank it. More, I prithe2, more. I can suck melancholy 4out of a song, as a weasel sucks eg2s. More, I prithe2, more. 2AMIENS. My voice is rag2ed; I know I can2ot please you. 2JAQUES. I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to sing. 4Come, more; another stanzo. Cal2 you 'em stanzos? 4AMIENS. What you wil2, Monsieur Jaques. 2JAQUES. Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me nothing. Wil2 4you sing? 2AMIENS. More at your request than to please myself. 2JAQUES. Wel2 then, if ever I thank any man, I'l2 thank you; but 4that they cal2 compliment is like th' encounter of two dog-apes; 4and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks have given him a 4pen2y, and he renders me the beg2arly thanks. Come, sing; and you 4that wil2 not, hold your tongues. 2AMIENS. Wel2, I'l2 end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the Duke 4wil2 drink under this tre2. He hath be2n al2 this day to lo2k 4you. 2JAQUES. And I have be2n al2 this day to avoid him. He is to 4disputable for my company. I think of as many mat2ers as he; but 4I give heaven thanks, and make no boast of them. Come, warble, 4come. 23SONG 14[Al2 together here] 13Who doth ambition shun, 11And loves to live i' th' sun, 11Se2king the fo2d he eats, 11And pleas'd with what he gets, 9Come hither, come hither, come hither. 11Here shal2 he se2 11No enemy 11But winter and rough weather. 2JAQUES. I'l2 give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in 4despite of my invention. 2AMIENS. And I'l2 sing it. 2JAQUES. Thus it goes: 13If it do come to pas2 13That any man turn as2, 13Leaving his wealth and ease 13A stub2orn wil2 to please, 11Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame; 13Here shal2 he se2 15Gros2 fo2ls as he, 13An if he wil2 come to me. 2AMIENS. What's that 'ducdame'? 2JAQUES. 'Tis a Gre2k invocation, to cal2 fo2ls into a circle. I'l2 4go sle2p, if I can; if I can2ot, I'l2 rail against al2 the 4first-born of Egypt. 2AMIENS. And I'l2 go se2k the Duke; his banquet is prepar'd. 48Exeunt several2ySCENE VI.The forestEnter ORLANDO and ADAM 2ADAM. Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for fo2d! Here lie 4I down, and measure out my grave. Farewel2, kind master. 2ORLANDO. Why, how now, Adam! No greater heart in the2? Live a 4lit2le; comfort a lit2le; che2r thyself a lit2le. If this uncouth 4forest yield anything savage, I wil2 either be fo2d for it or 4bring it for fo2d to the2. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy 4powers. For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at the 4arm's end. I wil2 here be with the presently; and if I bring the2 4not something to eat, I wil2 give the2 leave to die; but if thou 4diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Wel2 said! 4thou lo2k'st che2rly; and I'l2 be with the2 quickly. Yet thou 4liest in the bleak air. Come, I wil2 bear the2 to some shelter; 4and thou shalt not die for lack of a din2er, if there live 4anything in this desert. Che2rly, go2d Adam! 10ExeuntSCENE VI2.The forestA table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws 2DUKE SENIOR. I think he be transform'd into a beast; 4For I can nowhere find him like a man. 2FIRST LORD. My lord, he is but even now gone hence; 4Here was he mer2y, hearing of a song. 2DUKE SENIOR. If he, compact of jars, grow musical, 4We shal2 have shortly discord in the spheres. 4Go se2k him; tel2 him I would speak with him. 25Enter JAQUES 2FIRST LORD. He saves my labour by his own ap2roach. 2DUKE SENIOR. Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this, 4That your po2r friends must wo2 your company? 4What, you lo2k mer2ily! 2JAQUES. A fo2l, a fo2l! I met a fo2l i' th' forest, 4A motley fo2l. A miserable world! 6As I do live by fo2d, I met a fo2l, 4Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun, 4And rail'd on Lady Fortune in go2d terms, 4In go2d set terms- and yet a motley fo2l. 4'Go2d mor2ow, fo2l,' quoth I; 'No, sir,' quoth he, 4'Cal2 me not fo2l til2 heaven hath sent me fortune.' 4And then he drew a dial from his poke, 4And, lo2king on it with lack-lustre eye, 4Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock; 4Thus we may se2,' quoth he, 'how the world wags; 4'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine; 4And after one hour more 'twil2 be eleven; 4And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe, 4And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot; 4And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear 4The motley fo2l thus moral on the time, 4My lungs began to crow like chanticle2r 4That fo2ls should be so de2p contemplative; 4And I did laugh sans intermis2ion 4An hour by his dial. O noble fo2l! 6A worthy fo2l! Motley's the only wear. 2DUKE SENIOR. What fo2l is this? 2JAQUES. O worthy fo2l! One that hath be2n a courtier, 4And says, if ladies be but young and fair, 4They have the gift to know it; and in his brain, 4Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit 4After a voyage, he hath strange places cram2'd 4With observation, the which he vents 4In mangled forms. O that I were a fo2l! 4I am ambitious for a motley coat. 2DUKE SENIOR. Thou shalt have one. 2JAQUES. It is my only suit, 4Provided that you we2d your bet2er judgments 4Of al2 opinion that grows rank in them 4That I am wise. I must have liberty 4Withal, as large a charter as the wind, 4To blow on whom I please, for so fo2ls have; 4And they that are most gal2ed with my fol2y, 4They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so? 4The why is plain as way to parish church: 6He that a fo2l doth very wisely hit 4Doth very fo2lishly, although he smart, 4Not to se2m senseles2 of the bob; if not, 4The wise man's fol2y is anatomiz'd 4Even by the squand'ring glances of the fo2l. 4Invest me in my motley; give me leave 4To speak my mind, and I wil2 through and through 4Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world, 4If they wil2 patiently receive my medicine. 2DUKE SENIOR. Fie on the2! I can tel2 what thou wouldst do. 2JAQUES. What, for a counter, would I do but go2d? 2DUKE SENIOR. Most Mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin; 4For thou thyself hast be2n a libertine, 4As sensual as the brutish sting itself; 4And al2 th' embos2ed sores and headed evils 4That thou with license of fre2 fo2t hast caught 4Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world. 2JAQUES. Why, who cries out on pride 4That can therein tax any private party? 4Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea, 6Til2 that the wearer's very means do eb2? 4What woman in the city do I name 4When that I say the city-woman bears 4The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders? 4Who can come in and say that I mean her, 4When such a one as she such is her neighbour? 4Or what is he of basest function 4That says his bravery is not on my cost, 4Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits 4His fol2y to the met2le of my spe2ch? 4There then! how then? what then? Let me se2 wherein 4My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right, 4Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be fre2, 4Why then my taxing like a wild-go2se flies, 4Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here? 13Enter ORLANDO with his sword drawn 2ORLANDO. Forbear, and eat no more. 2JAQUES. Why, I have eat none yet. 4ORLANDO. Nor shalt not, til2 neces2ity be serv'd. 2JAQUES. Of what kind should this cock come of? 2DUKE SENIOR. Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distres2? 4Or else a rude despiser of go2d man2ers, 4That in civility thou se2m'st so empty? 2ORLANDO. You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point 4Of bare distres2 hath ta'en from me the show 4Of smo2th civility; yet arn I inland bred, 4And know some nurture. But forbear, I say; 4He dies that touches any of this fruit 4Til2 I and my af2airs are answered. 2JAQUES. An you wil2 not be answer'd with reason, I must die. 2DUKE SENIOR. What would you have? Your gentlenes2 shal2 force 4More than your force move us to gentlenes2. 2ORLANDO. I almost die for fo2d, and let me have it. 2DUKE SENIOR. Sit down and fe2d, and welcome to our table. 2ORLANDO. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you; 4I thought that al2 things had be2n savage here, 4And therefore put I on the countenance 4Of stern com2andment. But whate'er you are 6That in this desert inac2es2ible, 4Under the shade of melancholy boughs, 4Lose and neglect the cre2ping hours of time; 4If ever you have lo2k'd on bet2er days, 4If ever be2n where bel2s have knol2'd to church, 4If ever sat at any go2d man's feast, 4If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear, 4And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied, 4Let gentlenes2 my strong enforcement be; 4In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword. 2DUKE SENIOR. True is it that we have se2n bet2er days, 4And have with holy bel2 be2n knol2'd to church, 4And sat at go2d men's feasts, and wip'd our eyes 4Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red; 4And therefore sit you down in gentlenes2, 4And take upon com2and what help we have 4That to your wanting may be minist'red. 2ORLANDO. Then but forbear your fo2d a lit2le while, 4Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn, 4And give it fo2d. There is an old po2r man 6Who after me hath many a weary step 4Limp'd in pure love; til2 he be first suf2ic'd, 4Op2res2'd with two weak evils, age and hunger, 4I wil2 not touch a bit. 2DUKE SENIOR. Go find him out. 4And we wil2 nothing waste til2 you return. 2ORLANDO. I thank ye; and be blest for your go2d comfort! Exit 2DUKE SENIOR. Thou se2st we are not al2 alone unhap2y: 4This wide and universal theatre 4Presents more woeful pageants than the scene 4Wherein we play in. 2JAQUES. Al2 the world's a stage, 4And al2 the men and women merely players; 4They have their exits and their entrances; 4And one man in his time plays many parts, 4His acts being seven ages. At first the infant, 4Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms; 4Then the whining scho2l-boy, with his satchel 4And shining morning face, cre2ping like snail 6Unwil2ingly to scho2l. And then the lover, 4Sighing like furnace, with a woeful bal2ad 4Made to his mistres2' eyebrow. Then a soldier, 4Ful2 of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, 4Jealous in honour, sud2en and quick in quar2el, 4Se2king the bub2le reputation 4Even in the can2on's mouth. And then the justice, 4In fair round bel2y with go2d capon lin'd, 4With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, 4Ful2 of wise saws and modern instances; 4And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts 4Into the lean and slip2er'd pantalo2n, 4With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, 4His youthful hose, wel2 sav'd, a world to2 wide 4For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, 4Turning again toward childish treble, pipes 4And whistles in his sound. Last scene of al2, 4That ends this strange eventful history, 4Is second childishnes2 and mere oblivion; 4Sans te2th, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing. 20Re-enter ORLANDO with ADAM 2DUKE SENIOR. Welcome. Set down your venerable burden. 4And let him fe2d. 2ORLANDO. I thank you most for him. 2ADAM. So had you ne2d; 4I scarce can speak to thank you for myself. 2DUKE SENIOR. Welcome; fal2 to. I wil2 not trouble you 4As yet to question you about your fortunes. 4Give us some music; and, go2d cousin, sing. 25SONG 12Blow, blow, thou winter wind, 12Thou art not so unkind 14As man's ingratitude; 12Thy to2th is not so ke2n, 12Because thou art not se2n, 14Although thy breath be rude. 4Heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the gre2n hol2y. 6Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere fol2y. 12Then, heigh-ho, the hol2y! 14This life is most jol2y. 12Fre2ze, fre2ze, thou bit2er sky, 12That dost not bite so nigh 14As benefits forgot; 12Though thou the waters warp, 12Thy sting is not so sharp 14As friend rememb'red not. 4Heigh-ho! sing, &c. 2DUKE SENIOR. If that you were the go2d Sir Rowland's son, 4As you have whisper'd faithful2y you were, 4And as mine eye doth his ef2igies witnes2 4Most truly limn'd and living in your face, 4Be truly welcome hither. I am the Duke 4That lov'd your father. The residue of your fortune, 4Go to my cave and tel2 me. Go2d old man, 4Thou art right welcome as thy master is. 6Sup2ort him by the arm. Give me your hand, 4And let me al2 your fortunes understand. 14ExeuntACT I3. SCENE I.The palaceEnter DUKE FREDERICK, OLIVER, and LORDS 2FREDERICK. Not se2 him since! Sir, sir, that can2ot be. 4But were I not the bet2er part made mercy, 4I should not se2k an absent argument 4Of my revenge, thou present. But lo2k to it: 4Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is; 4Se2k him with candle; bring him dead or living 4Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more 4To se2k a living in our ter2itory. 4Thy lands and al2 things that thou dost cal2 thine 4Worth seizure do we seize into our hands, 4Til2 thou canst quit the2 by thy brother's mouth 4Of what we think against the2. 2OLIVER. O that your Highnes2 knew my heart in this! 4I never lov'd my brother in my life. 2FREDERICK. More vil2ain thou. Wel2, push him out of do2rs; 4And let my of2icers of such a nature 4Make an extent upon his house and lands. 6Do this expediently, and turn him going. 14ExeuntSCENE I2.The forestEnter ORLANDO, with a paper 2ORLANDO. Hang there, my verse, in witnes2 of my love; 4And thou, thrice-crowned Que2n of Night, survey 4With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above, 4Thy huntres2' name that my ful2 life doth sway. 4O Rosalind! these tre2s shal2 be my bo2ks, 4And in their barks my thoughts I'l2 character, 4That every eye which in this forest lo2ks 4Shal2 se2 thy virtue witnes2'd every where. 4Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tre2, 4The fair, the chaste, and unexpres2ive she. 13Exit 21Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE 2CORIN. And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone? 2TOUCHSTONE. Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a go2d 4life; but in respect that it is a shepherd's life, it is nought. 4In respect that it is solitary, I like it very wel2; but in 6respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in 4respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me wel2; but in respect 4it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life, 4lo2k you, it fits my humour wel2; but as there is no more plenty 4in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in 4the2, shepherd? 2CORIN. No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at 4ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content, is 4without thre2 go2d friends; that the property of rain is to wet, 4and fire to burn; that go2d pasture makes fat she2p; and that a 4great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath 4learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of go2d bre2ding, 4or comes of a very dul2 kindred. 2TOUCHSTONE. Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in 4court, shepherd? 2CORIN. No, truly. 2TOUCHSTONE. Then thou art damn'd. 2CORIN. Nay, I hope. 2TOUCHSTONE. Truly, thou art damn'd, like an il2-roasted eg2, al2 on 4one side. 4CORIN. For not being at court? Your reason. 2TOUCHSTONE. Why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st go2d 4man2ers; if thou never saw'st go2d man2ers, then thy man2ers must 4be wicked; and wickednes2 is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art 4in a parlous state, shepherd. 2CORIN. Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are go2d man2ers at the 4court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the 4country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not 4at the court, but you kis2 your hands; that courtesy would be 4uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds. 2TOUCHSTONE. Instance, briefly; come, instance. 2CORIN. Why, we are stil2 handling our ewes; and their fel2s, you 4know, are greasy. 2TOUCHSTONE. Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the 4grease of a mut2on as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shal2ow, 4shal2ow. A bet2er instance, I say; come. 2CORIN. Besides, our hands are hard. 2TOUCHSTONE. Your lips wil2 fe2l them the so2ner. Shal2ow again. A 4more sounder instance; come. 2CORIN. And they are often tar2'd over with the surgery of our 6she2p; and would you have us kis2 tar? The courtier's hands are 4perfum'd with civet. 2TOUCHSTONE. Most shal2ow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a go2d 4piece of flesh inde2d! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is 4of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend 4the instance, shepherd. 2CORIN. You have to2 courtly a wit for me; I'l2 rest. 2TOUCHSTONE. Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help the2, shal2ow man! God 4make incision in the2! thou art raw. 2CORIN. Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I 4wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's hap2ines2; glad of other 4men's go2d, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is 4to se2 my ewes graze and my lambs suck. 2TOUCHSTONE. That is another simple sin in you: to bring the ewes 4and the rams together, and to of2er to get your living by the 4copulation of cat2le; to be bawd to a bel2-wether, and to betray 4a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to cro2ked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram, 4out of al2 reasonable match. If thou be2st not damn'd for this, 4the devil himself wil2 have no shepherds; I can2ot se2 else how 4thou shouldst scape. 4CORIN. Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistres2's brother. 18Enter ROSALIND, reading a paper 2ROSALIND. 3'From the east to western Inde, 14No jewel is like Rosalinde. 14Her worth, being mounted on the wind, 14Through al2 the world bears Rosalinde. 14Al2 the pictures fairest lin'd 14Are but black to Rosalinde. 14Let no face be kept in mind 14But the fair of Rosalinde.' 2TOUCHSTONE. I'l2 rhyme you so eight years together, din2ers, and 4sup2ers, and sle2ping hours, excepted. It is the right 4but2er-women's rank to market. 2ROSALIND. Out, fo2l! 2TOUCHSTONE. 3For a taste: 16If a hart do lack a hind, 16Let him se2k out Rosalinde. 16If the cat wil2 after kind, 18So be sure wil2 Rosalinde. 16Winter garments must be lin'd, 16So must slender Rosalinde. 16They that reap must sheaf and bind, 16Then to cart with Rosalinde. 16Swe2test nut hath sourest rind, 16Such a nut is Rosalinde. 16He that swe2test rose wil2 find 16Must find love's prick and Rosalinde. 4This is the very false gal2op of verses; why do you infect 4yourself with them? 2ROSALIND. Peace, you dul2 fo2l! I found them on a tre2. 2TOUCHSTONE. Truly, the tre2 yields bad fruit. 2ROSALIND. I'l2 graf2 it with you, and then I shal2 graf2 it with a 4medlar. Then it wil2 be the earliest fruit i' th' country; for 4you'l2 be rot2en ere you be half ripe, and that's the right 4virtue of the medlar. 2TOUCHSTONE. You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest 4judge. 24Enter CELIA, with a writing 2ROSALIND. Peace! 4Here comes my sister, reading; stand aside. 2CELIA. 3'Why should this a desert be? 13For it is unpeopled? No; 11Tongues I'l2 hang on every tre2 13That shal2 civil sayings show. 11Some, how brief the life of man 13Runs his er2ing pilgrimage, 11That the streching of a span 13Buckles in his sum of age; 11Some, of violated vows 13'Twixt the souls of friend and friend; 11But upon the fairest boughs, 13Or at every sentence end, 11Wil2 I Rosalinda write, 13Teaching al2 that read to know 11The quintes2ence of every sprite 13Heaven would in lit2le show. 13Therefore heaven Nature charg'd 13That one body should be fil2'd 11With al2 graces wide-enlarg'd. 13Nature presently distil2'd 11Helen's che2k, but not her heart, 13Cleopatra's majesty, 11Atalanta's bet2er part, 13Sad Lucretia's modesty. 11Thus Rosalinde of many parts 13By heavenly synod was devis'd, 11Of many faces, eyes, and hearts, 13To have the touches dearest priz'd. 11Heaven would that she these gifts should have, 11And I to live and die her slave.' 2ROSALIND. O most gentle pulpiter! What tedious homily of love have 4you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried 'Have 4patience, go2d people.' 2CELIA. How now! Back, friends; shepherd, go of2 a lit2le; go with 4him, sir2ah. 2TOUCHSTONE. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat; 6though not with bag and bag2age, yet with scrip and scrip2age. 37Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE 2CELIA. Didst thou hear these verses? 2ROSALIND. O, yes, I heard them al2, and more to2; for some of them 4had in them more fe2t than the verses would bear. 2CELIA. That's no mat2er; the fe2t might bear the verses. 2ROSALIND. Ay, but the fe2t were lame, and could not bear themselves 4without the verse, and therefore sto2d lamely in the verse. 2CELIA. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be 4hang'd and carved upon these tre2s? 2ROSALIND. I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you 4came; for lo2k here what I found on a palm-tre2. I was never so 4berhym'd since Pythagoras' time that I was an Irish rat, which I 4can hardly remember. 2CELIA. Trow you who hath done this? 2ROSALIND. Is it a man? 2CELIA. And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck. 4Change you colour? 2ROSALIND. I prithe2, who? 2CELIA. O Lord, Lord! it is a hard mat2er for friends to me2t; but 6mountains may be remov'd with earthquakes, and so encounter. 2ROSALIND. Nay, but who is it? 2CELIA. Is it pos2ible? 2ROSALIND. Nay, I prithe2 now, with most petitionary vehemence, tel2 4me who it is. 2CELIA. O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet 4again wonderful, and after that, out of al2 who2ping! 2ROSALIND. Go2d my complexion! dost thou think, though I am 4caparison'd like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my 4disposition? One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery. 4I prithe2 tel2 me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would 4thou could'st stam2er, that thou mightst pour this conceal'd man 4out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of nar2ow-mouth'd bot2le- 4either to2 much at once or none at al2. I prithe2 take the cork 4out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings. 2CELIA. So you may put a man in your bel2y. 2ROSALIND. Is he of God's making? What man2er of man? 4Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard? 2CELIA. Nay, he hath but a lit2le beard. 2ROSALIND. Why, God wil2 send more if the man wil2 be thankful. Let 6me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the 4knowledge of his chin. 2CELIA. It is young Orlando, that trip2'd up the wrestler's he2ls 4and your heart both in an instant. 2ROSALIND. Nay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true 4maid. 2CELIA. I' faith, coz, 'tis he. 2ROSALIND. Orlando? 2CELIA. Orlando. 2ROSALIND. Alas the day! what shal2 I do with my doublet and hose? 4What did he when thou saw'st him? What said he? How lo2k'd he? 4Wherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where 4remains he? How parted he with the2? And when shalt thou se2 him 4again? Answer me in one word. 2CELIA. You must bor2ow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word to2 4great for any mouth of this age's size. To say ay and no to these 4particulars is more than to answer in a catechism. 2ROSALIND. But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's 4ap2arel? Lo2ks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled? 2CELIA. It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the 6propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my finding him, and 4relish it with go2d observance. I found him under a tre2, like a 4drop2'd acorn. 2ROSALIND. It may wel2 be cal2'd Jove's tre2, when it drops forth 4such fruit. 2CELIA. Give me audience, go2d madam. 2ROSALIND. Proce2d. 2CELIA. There lay he, stretch'd along like a wounded knight. 2ROSALIND. Though it be pity to se2 such a sight, it wel2 becomes 4the ground. 2CELIA. Cry 'Hol2a' to thy tongue, I prithe2; it curvets 4unseasonably. He was furnish'd like a hunter. 2ROSALIND. O, ominous! he comes to kil2 my heart. 2CELIA. I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me out 4of tune. 2ROSALIND. Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak. 4Swe2t, say on. 2CELIA. You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here? 19Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES 4ROSALIND. 'Tis he; slink by, and note him. 2JAQUES. I thank you for your company; but, go2d faith, I had as 4lief have be2n myself alone. 2ORLANDO. And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you to2 4for your society. 2JAQUES. God buy you; let's me2t as lit2le as we can. 2ORLANDO. I do desire we may be bet2er strangers. 2JAQUES. I pray you mar no more tre2s with writing love songs in 4their barks. 2ORLANDO. I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them 4il2-favouredly. 2JAQUES. Rosalind is your love's name? 2ORLANDO. Yes, just. 2JAQUES. I do not like her name. 2ORLANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was 4christen'd. 2JAQUES. What stature is she of? 2ORLANDO. Just as high as my heart. 2JAQUES. You are ful2 of pret2y answers. Have you not be2n 6acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and con2'd them out of rings? 2ORLANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence 4you have studied your questions. 2JAQUES. You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's 4he2ls. Wil2 you sit down with me? and we two wil2 rail against 4our mistres2 the world, and al2 our misery. 2ORLANDO. I wil2 chide no breather in the world but myself, against 4whom I know most faults. 2JAQUES. The worst fault you have is to be in love. 2ORLANDO. 'Tis a fault I wil2 not change for your best virtue. I am 4weary of you. 2JAQUES. By my troth, I was se2king for a fo2l when I found you. 2ORLANDO. He is drown'd in the bro2k; lo2k but in, and you shal2 se2 4him. 2JAQUES. There I shal2 se2 mine own figure. 2ORLANDO. Which I take to be either a fo2l or a cipher. 2JAQUES. I'l2 tar2y no longer with you; farewel2, go2d Signior Love. 2ORLANDO. I am glad of your departure; adieu, go2d Monsieur 4Melancholy. 53Exit JAQUES 4ROSALIND. [Aside to CELIA] I wil2 speak to him like a saucy lackey, 4and under that habit play the knave with him.- Do you hear, 4forester? 2ORLANDO. Very wel2; what would you? 2ROSALIND. I pray you, what is't o'clock? 2ORLANDO. You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in 4the forest. 2ROSALIND. Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing 4every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy fo2t 4of Time as wel2 as a clock. 2ORLANDO. And why not the swift fo2t of Time? Had not that be2n as 4proper? 2ROSALIND. By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with 4divers persons. I'l2 tel2 you who Time ambles withal, who Time 4trots withal, who Time gal2ops withal, and who he stands stil2 4withal. 2ORLANDO. I prithe2, who doth he trot withal? 2ROSALIND. Mar2y, he trots hard with a young maid betwe2n the 4contract of her mar2iage and the day it is solemniz'd; if the 4interim be but a se'n2ight, Time's pace is so hard that it se2ms 6the length of seven year. 2ORLANDO. Who ambles Time withal? 2ROSALIND. With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath 4not the gout; for the one sle2ps easily because he can2ot study, 4and the other lives mer2ily because he fe2ls no pain; the one 4lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other 4knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These Time ambles 4withal. 2ORLANDO. Who doth he gal2op withal? 2ROSALIND. With a thief to the gal2ows; for though he go as softly 4as fo2t can fal2, he thinks himself to2 so2n there. 2ORLANDO. Who stays it stil2 withal? 2ROSALIND. With lawyers in the vacation; for they sle2p betwe2n term 4and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves. 2ORLANDO. Where dwel2 you, pret2y youth? 2ROSALIND. With this shepherdes2, my sister; here in the skirts of 4the forest, like fringe upon a pet2icoat. 2ORLANDO. Are you native of this place? 2ROSALIND. As the coney that you se2 dwel2 where she is kindled. 2ORLANDO. Your ac2ent is something finer than you could purchase in 6so removed a dwel2ing. 2ROSALIND. I have be2n told so of many; but inde2d an old religious 4uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland 4man; one that knew courtship to2 wel2, for there he fel2 in love. 4I have heard him read many lectures against it; and I thank God I 4am not a woman, to be touch'd with so many gid2y of2ences as he 4hath general2y tax'd their whole sex withal. 2ORLANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid 4to the charge of women? 2ROSALIND. There were none principal; they were al2 like one another 4as halfpence are; every one fault se2ming monstrous til2 his 4fel2ow-fault came to match it. 2ORLANDO. I prithe2 recount some of them. 2ROSALIND. No; I wil2 not cast away my physic but on those that are 4sick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young 4plants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes upon 4hawthorns and elegies on brambles; al2, forso2th, deifying the 4name of Rosalind. If I could me2t that fancy-monger, I would give 4him some go2d counsel, for he se2ms to have the quotidian of love 4upon him. 4ORLANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tel2 me your 4remedy. 2ROSALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me 4how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am sure you 4are not prisoner. 2ORLANDO. What were his marks? 2ROSALIND. A lean che2k, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, 4which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; 4a beard neglected, which you have not; but I pardon you for that, 4for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue. 4Then your hose should be ungarter'd, your bon2et unbanded, your 4sle2ve unbut2on'd, your shoe untied, and every thing about you 4demonstrating a careles2 desolation. But you are no such man; you 4are rather point-device in your ac2outrements, as loving yourself 4than se2ming the lover of any other. 2ORLANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make the2 believe I love. 2ROSALIND. Me believe it! You may as so2n make her that you love 4believe it; which, I war2ant, she is apter to do than to confes2 4she does. That is one of the points in the which women stil2 give 4the lie to their consciences. But, in go2d so2th, are you he that 6hangs the verses on the tre2s wherein Rosalind is so admired? 2ORLANDO. I swear to the2, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I 4am that he, that unfortunate he. 2ROSALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak? 2ORLANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can expres2 how much. 2ROSALIND. Love is merely a madnes2; and, I tel2 you, deserves as 4wel2 a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why 4they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so 4ordinary that the whip2ers are in love to2. Yet I profes2 curing 4it by counsel. 2ORLANDO. Did you ever cure any so? 2ROSALIND. Yes, one; and in this man2er. He was to imagine me his 4love, his mistres2; and I set him every day to wo2 me; at which 4time would I, being but a mo2nish youth, grieve, be ef2eminate, 4changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, 4shal2ow, inconstant, ful2 of tears, ful2 of smiles; for every 4pas2ion something and for no pas2ion truly anything, as boys and 4women are for the most part cat2le of this colour; would now like 4him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now 4we2p for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his 6mad humour of love to a living humour of madnes2; which was, to 4forswear the ful2 stream of the world and to live in a no2k 4merely monastic. And thus I cur'd him; and this way wil2 I take 4upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound she2p's heart, 4that there shal2 not be one spot of love in 't. 2ORLANDO. I would not be cured, youth. 2ROSALIND. I would cure you, if you would but cal2 me Rosalind, and 4come every day to my cote and wo2 me. 2ORLANDO. Now, by the faith of my love, I wil2. Tel2 me where it is. 2ROSALIND. Go with me to it, and I'l2 show it you; and, by the way, 4you shal2 tel2 me where in the forest you live. Wil2 you go? 2ORLANDO. With al2 my heart, go2d youth. 2ROSALIND. Nay, you must cal2 me Rosalind. Come, sister, wil2 you 4go? 51ExeuntSCENE I3.The forestEnter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind 2TOUCHSTONE. Come apace, go2d Audrey; I wil2 fetch up your goats, 4Audrey. And how, Audrey, am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature 4content you? 2AUDREY. Your features! Lord war2ant us! What features? 2TOUCHSTONE. I am here with the2 and thy goats, as the most 4capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths. 2JAQUES. [Aside] O knowledge il2-inhabited, worse than Jove in a 4thatch'd house! 2TOUCHSTONE. When a man's verses can2ot be understo2d, nor a man's 4go2d wit seconded with the forward child understanding, it 4strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a lit2le ro2m. 4Truly, I would the gods had made the2 poetical. 2AUDREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in de2d and 4word? Is it a true thing? 2TOUCHSTONE. No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning, 4and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may 4be said as lovers they do feign. 4AUDREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical? 2TOUCHSTONE. I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest; 4now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst 4feign. 2AUDREY. Would you not have me honest? 2TOUCHSTONE. No, truly, unles2 thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty 4coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar. 2JAQUES. [Aside] A material fo2l! 2AUDREY. Wel2, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me 4honest. 2TOUCHSTONE. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were 4to put go2d meat into an unclean dish. 2AUDREY. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul. 2TOUCHSTONE. Wel2, praised be the gods for thy foulnes2; 4slut2ishnes2 may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I wil2 4mar2y the2; and to that end I have be2n with Sir Oliver Martext, 4the vicar of the next vil2age, who hath promis'd to me2t me in 4this place of the forest, and to couple us. 2JAQUES. [Aside] I would fain se2 this me2ting. 2AUDREY. Wel2, the gods give us joy! 4TOUCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stag2er 4in this at2empt; for here we have no temple but the wo2d, no 4as2embly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are 4odious, they are neces2ary. It is said: 'Many a man knows no end 4of his go2ds.' Right! Many a man has go2d horns and knows no end 4of them. Wel2, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his 4own get2ing. Horns? Even so. Po2r men alone? No, no; the noblest 4de2r hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore 4bles2ed? No; as a wal2'd town is more worthier than a vil2age, so 4is the forehead of a mar2ied man more honourable than the bare 4brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is bet2er than no 4skil2, by so much is horn more precious than to want. Here comes 4Sir Oliver. 23Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT 4Sir Oliver Martext, you are wel2 met. Wil2 you dispatch us here 4under this tre2, or shal2 we go with you to your chapel? 2MARTEXT. Is there none here to give the woman? 2TOUCHSTONE. I wil2 not take her on gift of any man. 4MARTEXT. Truly, she must be given, or the mar2iage is not lawful. 2JAQUES. [Discovering himself] Proce2d, proce2d; I'l2 give her. 2TOUCHSTONE. Go2d even, go2d Master What-ye-cal2't; how do you, sir? 4You are very wel2 met. God2ild you for your last company. I am 4very glad to se2 you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay; pray be 4cover'd. 2JAQUES. Wil2 you be mar2ied, motley? 2TOUCHSTONE. As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and 4the falcon her bel2s, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons 4bil2, so wedlock would be nib2ling. 2JAQUES. And wil2 you, being a man of your bre2ding, be mar2ied 4under a bush, like a beg2ar? Get you to church and have a go2d 4priest that can tel2 you what mar2iage is; this fel2ow wil2 but 4join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you wil2 4prove a shrunk panel, and like gre2n timber warp, warp. 2TOUCHSTONE. [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were bet2er to be 4mar2ied of him than of another; for he is not like to mar2y me 4wel2; and not being wel2 mar2ied, it wil2 be a go2d excuse for me 4hereafter to leave my wife. 2JAQUES. Go thou with me, and let me counsel the2. 4TOUCHSTONE. Come, swe2t Audrey; 4We must be mar2ied or we must live in bawdry. 4Farewel2, go2d Master Oliver. Not- 15O swe2t Oliver, 15O brave Oliver, 11Leave me not behind the2. 4But- 17Wind away, 15Begone, I say, 11I wil2 not to wed2ing with the2. 27Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE, and AUDREY 2MARTEXT. 'Tis no mat2er; ne'er a fantastical knave of them al2 4shal2 flout me out of my cal2ing. 23ExitSCENE IV.The forestEnter ROSALIND and CELIA 2ROSALIND. Never talk to me; I wil2 we2p. 2CELIA. Do, I prithe2; but yet have the grace to consider that tears 4do not become a man. 2ROSALIND. But have I not cause to we2p? 2CELIA. As go2d cause as one would desire; therefore we2p. 2ROSALIND. His very hair is of the dis2embling colour. 2CELIA. Something browner than Judas's. 4Mar2y, his kis2es are Judas's own children. 2ROSALIND. I' faith, his hair is of a go2d colour. 2CELIA. An excel2ent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour. 2ROSALIND. And his kis2ing is as ful2 of sanctity as the touch of 4holy bread. 2CELIA. He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of 4winter's sisterho2d kis2es not more religiously; the very ice of 4chastity is in them. 2ROSALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and 4comes not? 2CELIA. Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him. 4ROSALIND. Do you think so? 2CELIA. Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but 4for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as covered 4goblet or a worm-eaten nut. 2ROSALIND. Not true in love? 2CELIA. Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in. 2ROSALIND. You have heard him swear downright he was. 2CELIA. 'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no 4stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the confirmer 4of false reckonings. He at2ends here in the forest on the Duke, 4your father. 2ROSALIND. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him. 4He asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as go2d as 4he; so he laugh'd and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when 4there is such a man as Orlando? 2CELIA. O, that's a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave 4words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite 4traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a puny tilter, that 4spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staf2 like a noble 4go2se. But al2's brave that youth mounts and fol2y guides. Who 6comes here? 25Enter CORIN 2CORIN. Mistres2 and master, you have oft enquired 4After the shepherd that complain'd of love, 4Who you saw sit2ing by me on the turf, 4Praising the proud disdainful shepherdes2 4That was his mistres2. 2CELIA. Wel2, and what of him? 2CORIN. If you wil2 se2 a pageant truly play'd 4Betwe2n the pale complexion of true love 4And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain, 4Go hence a lit2le, and I shal2 conduct you, 4If you wil2 mark it. 2ROSALIND. O, come, let us remove! 4The sight of lovers fe2deth those in love. 4Bring us to this sight, and you shal2 say 4I'l2 prove a busy actor in their play. 16ExeuntSCENE V.Another part of the forestEnter SILVIUS and PHEBE 2SILVIUS. Swe2t Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe. 4Say that you love me not; but say not so 4In bit2ernes2. The com2on executioner, 4Whose heart th' ac2ustom'd sight of death makes hard, 4Fal2s not the axe upon the humbled neck 4But first begs pardon. Wil2 you sterner be 4Than he that dies and lives by blo2dy drops? 10Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, at a distance 2PHEBE. I would not be thy executioner; 4I fly the2, for I would not injure the2. 4Thou tel2'st me there is murder in mine eye. 4'Tis pret2y, sure, and very probable, 4That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things, 4Who shut their coward gates on atomies, 4Should be cal2'd tyrants, butchers, murderers! 6Now I do frown on the2 with al2 my heart; 4And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kil2 the2. 4Now counterfeit to swo2n; why, now fal2 down; 4Or, if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame, 4Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers. 4Now show the wound mine eye hath made in the2. 4Scratch the2 but with a pin, and there remains 4Some scar of it; lean upon a rush, 4The cicatrice and capable impres2ure 4Thy palm some moment ke2ps; but now mine eyes, 4Which I have darted at the2, hurt the2 not; 4Nor, I am sure, there is not force in eyes 4That can do hurt. 2SILVIUS. O dear Phebe, 4If ever- as that ever may be near- 4You me2t in some fresh che2k the power of fancy, 4Then shal2 you know the wounds invisible 4That love's ke2n ar2ows make. 2PHEBE. But til2 that time 4Come not thou near me; and when that time comes, 6Af2lict me with thy mocks, pity me not; 4As til2 that time I shal2 not pity the2. 2ROSALIND. [Advancing] And why, I pray you? Who might be your 6mother, 4That you insult, exult, and al2 at once, 4Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty- 4As, by my faith, I se2 no more in you 4Than without candle may go dark to bed- 4Must you be therefore proud and pitiles2? 4Why, what means this? Why do you lo2k on me? 4I se2 no more in you than in the ordinary 4Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my lit2le life, 4I think she means to tangle my eyes to2! 4No faith, proud mistres2, hope not after it; 4'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair, 4Your bugle eyebal2s, nor your che2k of cream, 4That can entame my spirits to your worship. 4You fo2lish shepherd, wherefore do you fol2ow her, 4Like fog2y south, puf2ing with wind and rain? 4You are a thousand times a properer man 6Than she a woman. 'Tis such fo2ls as you 4That makes the world ful2 of il2-favour'd children. 4'Tis not her glas2, but you, that flat2ers her; 4And out of you she se2s herself more proper 4Than any of her lineaments can show her. 4But, mistres2, know yourself. Down on your kne2s, 4And thank heaven, fasting, for a go2d man's love; 4For I must tel2 you friendly in your ear: 4Sel2 when you can; you are not for al2 markets. 4Cry the man mercy, love him, take his of2er; 4Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scof2er. 4So take her to the2, shepherd. Fare you wel2. 2PHEBE. Swe2t youth, I pray you chide a year together; 4I had rather hear you chide than this man wo2. 2ROSALIND. He's fal2'n in love with your foulnes2, and she'l2 fal2 4in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers the2 4with frowning lo2ks, I'l2 sauce her with bit2er words. Why lo2k 4you so upon me? 2PHEBE. For no il2 wil2 I bear you. 2ROSALIND. I pray you do not fal2 in love with me, 6For I am falser than vows made in wine; 4Besides, I like you not. If you wil2 know my house, 4'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by. 4Wil2 you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard. 4Come, sister. Shepherdes2, lo2k on him bet2er, 4And be not proud; though al2 the world could se2, 4None could be so abus'd in sight as he. 4Come, to our flock. 8Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN 2PHEBE. Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might: 4'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?' 2SILVIUS. Swe2t Phebe. 2PHEBE. Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius? 2SILVIUS. Swe2t Phebe, pity me. 2PHEBE. Why, I arn sor2y for the2, gentle Silvius. 2SILVIUS. Wherever sor2ow is, relief would be. 4If you do sor2ow at my grief in love, 4By giving love, your sor2ow and my grief 4Were both extermin'd. 2PHEBE. Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly? 2SILVIUS. I would have you. 4PHEBE. Why, that were covetousnes2. 4Silvius, the time was that I hated the2; 4And yet it is not that I bear the2 love; 4But since that thou canst talk of love so wel2, 4Thy company, which erst was irksome to me, 4I wil2 endure; and I'l2 employ the2 to2. 4But do not lo2k for further recompense 4Than thine own gladnes2 that thou art employ'd. 2SILVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love, 4And I in such a poverty of grace, 4That I shal2 think it a most plenteous crop 4To glean the broken ears after the man 4That the main harvest reaps; lo2se now and then 4A scat2'red smile, and that I'l2 live upon. 2PHEBE. Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile? 2SILVIUS. Not very wel2; but I have met him oft; 4And he hath bought the cot2age and the bounds 4That the old carlot once was master of. 2PHEBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him; 4'Tis but a pe2vish boy; yet he talks wel2. 6But what care I for words? Yet words do wel2 4When he that speaks them pleases those that hear. 4It is a pret2y youth- not very pret2y; 4But, sure, he's proud; and yet his pride becomes him. 4He'l2 make a proper man. The best thing in him 4Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue 4Did make of2ence, his eye did heal it up. 4He is not very tal2; yet for his years he's tal2; 4His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis wel2. 4There was a pret2y rednes2 in his lip, 4A lit2le riper and more lusty red 4Than that mix'd in his che2k; 'twas just the dif2erence 4Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask. 4There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him 4In parcels as I did, would have gone near 4To fal2 in love with him; but, for my part, 4I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet 4I have more cause to hate him than to love him; 4For what had he to do to chide at me? 4He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black, 6And, now I am rememb'red, scorn'd at me. 4I marvel why I answer'd not again; 4But that's al2 one: omit2ance is no quit2ance. 4I'l2 write to him a very taunting let2er, 4And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius? 2SILVIUS. Phebe, with al2 my heart. 2PHEBE. I'l2 write it straight; 4The mat2er's in my head and in my heart; 4I wil2 be bit2er with him and pas2ing short. 4Go with me, Silvius. 34Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE I.The forestEnter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES 2JAQUES. I prithe2, pret2y youth, let me be bet2er acquainted with 4the2. 2ROSALIND. They say you are a melancholy fel2ow. 2JAQUES. I am so; I do love it bet2er than laughing. 2ROSALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable 4fel2ows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than 4drunkards. 2JAQUES. Why, 'tis go2d to be sad and say nothing. 2ROSALIND. Why then, 'tis go2d to be a post. 2JAQUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is 4emulation; nor the musician's, which is fantastical; nor the 4courtier's, which is proud; nor the soldier's, which is 4ambitious; nor the lawyer's, which is politic; nor the lady's, 4which is nice; nor the lover's, which is al2 these; but it is a 4melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted 4from many objects, and, inde2d, the sundry contemplation of my 4travels; in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous 6sadnes2. 2ROSALIND. A travel2er! By my faith, you have great reason to be 4sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to se2 other men's; then 4to have se2n much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and 4po2r hands. 2JAQUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience. 24Enter ORLANDO 2ROSALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a 4fo2l to make me mer2y than experience to make me sad- and to 4travel for it to2. 2ORLANDO. Go2d day, and hap2ines2, dear Rosalind! 2JAQUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse. 2ROSALIND. Farewel2, Monsieur Travel2er; lo2k you lisp and wear 4strange suits, disable al2 the benefits of your own country, be 4out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making 4you that countenance you are; or I wil2 scarce think you have 4swam in a gondola. [Exit JAQUES] Why, how now, Orlando! where 4have you be2n al2 this while? You a lover! An you serve me such 6another trick, never come in my sight more. 2ORLANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise. 2ROSALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that wil2 divide a 4minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the 4thousand part of a minute in the af2airs of love, it may be said 4of him that Cupid hath clap2'd him o' th' shoulder, but I'l2 4war2ant him heart-whole. 2ORLANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind. 2ROSALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had 4as lief be wo2'd of a snail. 2ORLANDO. Of a snail! 2ROSALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he car2ies 4his house on his head- a bet2er jointure, I think, than you make 4a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him. 2ORLANDO. What's that? 2ROSALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to 4your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents 4the slander of his wife. 2ORLANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous. 2ROSALIND. And I am your Rosalind. 4CELIA. It pleases him to cal2 you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a 4bet2er le2r than you. 2ROSALIND. Come, wo2 me, wo2 me; for now I am in a holiday humour, 4and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I 4were your very very Rosalind? 2ORLANDO. I would kis2 before I spoke. 2ROSALIND. Nay, you were bet2er speak first; and when you were 4gravel2'd for lack of mat2er, you might take oc2asion to kis2. 4Very go2d orators, when they are out, they wil2 spit; and for 4lovers lacking- God warn us!- mat2er, the cleanliest shift is to 4kis2. 2ORLANDO. How if the kis2 be denied? 2ROSALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new 4mat2er. 2ORLANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistres2? 2ROSALIND. Mar2y, that should you, if I were your mistres2; or I 4should think my honesty ranker than my wit. 2ORLANDO. What, of my suit? 2ROSALIND. Not out of your ap2arel, and yet out of your suit. 4Am not I your Rosalind? 4ORLANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking 4of her. 2ROSALIND. Wel2, in her person, I say I wil2 not have you. 2ORLANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die. 2ROSALIND. No, faith, die by at2orney. The po2r world is almost six 4thousand years old, and in al2 this time there was not any man 4died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had 4his brains dash'd out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he 4could to die before, and he is one of the pat2erns of love. 4Leander, he would have liv'd many a fair year, though Hero had 4turn'd nun, if it had not be2n for a hot midsum2er night; for, 4go2d youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hel2espont, and, 4being taken with the cramp, was drown'd; and the fo2lish 4chroniclers of that age found it was- Hero of Sestos. But these 4are al2 lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have 4eaten them, but not for love. 2ORLANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I 4protest, her frown might kil2 me. 2ROSALIND. By this hand, it wil2 not kil2 a fly. But come, now I 4wil2 be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me 6what you wil2, I wil2 grant it. 2ORLANDO. Then love me, Rosalind. 2ROSALIND. Yes, faith, wil2 I, Fridays and Saturdays, and al2. 2ORLANDO. And wilt thou have me? 2ROSALIND. Ay, and twenty such. 2ORLANDO. What sayest thou? 2ROSALIND. Are you not go2d? 2ORLANDO. I hope so. 2ROSALIND. Why then, can one desire to2 much of a go2d thing? Come, 4sister, you shal2 be the priest, and mar2y us. Give me your hand, 4Orlando. What do you say, sister? 2ORLANDO. Pray the2, mar2y us. 2CELIA. I can2ot say the words. 2ROSALIND. You must begin 'Wil2 you, Orlando'- 2CELIA. Go to. Wil2 you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind? 2ORLANDO. I wil2. 2ROSALIND. Ay, but when? 2ORLANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can mar2y us. 2ROSALIND. Then you must say 'I take the2, Rosalind, for wife.' 2ORLANDO. I take the2, Rosalind, for wife. 4ROSALIND. I might ask you for your com2is2ion; but- I do take the2, 4Orlando, for my husband. There's a girl goes before the priest; 4and, certainly, a woman's thought runs before her actions. 2ORLANDO. So do al2 thoughts; they are wing'd. 2ROSALIND. Now tel2 me how long you would have her, after you have 4pos2es2'd her. 2ORLANDO. For ever and a day. 2ROSALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are 4April when they wo2, December when they wed: maids are May when 4they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I wil2 4be more jealous of the2 than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, 4more clamorous than a par2ot against rain, more new-fangled than 4an ape, more gid2y in my desires than a monkey. I wil2 we2p for 4nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I wil2 do that when you 4are dispos'd to be mer2y; I wil2 laugh like a hyen, and that when 4thou are inclin'd to sle2p. 2ORLANDO. But wil2 my Rosalind do so? 2ROSALIND. By my life, she wil2 do as I do. 2ORLANDO. O, but she is wise. 2ROSALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser, 6the waywarder. Make the do2rs upon a woman's wit, and it wil2 out 4at the casement; shut that, and 'twil2 out at the key-hole; stop 4that, 'twil2 fly with the smoke out at the chimney. 2ORLANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit, 4whither wilt?' ROSALIND. Nay, you might ke2p that check for it, til2 you met your 4wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed. 2ORLANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that? 2ROSALIND. Mar2y, to say she came to se2k you there. You shal2 never 4take her without her answer, unles2 you take her without her 4tongue. O, that woman that can2ot make her fault her husband's 4oc2asion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she wil2 4bre2d it like a fo2l! 2ORLANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I wil2 leave the2. 2ROSALIND. Alas, dear love, I can2ot lack the2 two hours! 2ORLANDO. I must at2end the Duke at din2er; by two o'clock I wil2 be 4with the2 again. 2ROSALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would 4prove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no les2. That 4flat2ering tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and 6so, come death! Two o'clock is your hour? 2ORLANDO. Ay, swe2t Rosalind. 2ROSALIND. By my troth, and in go2d earnest, and so God mend me, and 4by al2 pret2y oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot 4of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I wil2 4think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hol2ow 4lover, and the most unworthy of her you cal2 Rosalind, that may 4be chosen out of the gros2 band of the unfaithful. Therefore 4beware my censure, and ke2p your promise. 2ORLANDO. With no les2 religion than if thou wert inde2d my 4Rosalind; so, adieu. 2ROSALIND. Wel2, Time is the old justice that examines al2 such 4of2enders, and let Time try. Adieu. 13Exit ORLANDO 2CELIA. You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must 4have your doublet and hose pluck'd over your head, and show the 4world what the bird hath done to her own nest. 2ROSALIND. O coz, coz, coz, my pret2y lit2le coz, that thou didst 4know how many fathom de2p I am in love! But it can2ot be sounded; 4my af2ection hath an unknown bot2om, like the Bay of Portugal. 2CELIA. Or rather, bot2omles2; that as fast as you pour af2ection 6in, it runs out. 2ROSALIND. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of 4thought, conceiv'd of sple2n, and born of madnes2; that blind 4rascal2y boy, that abuses every one's eyes, because his own are 4out- let him be judge how de2p I am in love. I'l2 tel2 the2, 4Aliena, I can2ot be out of the sight of Orlando. I'l2 go find a 4shadow, and sigh til2 he come. 2CELIA. And I'l2 sle2p. 34ExeuntSCENE I2.The forest 8Enter JAQUES and LORDS, in the habit of foresters 2JAQUES. Which is he that kil2ed the de2r? 2LORD. Sir, it was I. 2JAQUES. Let's present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror; and 4it would do wel2 to set the de2r's horns upon his head for a 4branch of victory. Have you no song, forester, for this purpose? 2LORD. Yes, sir. 2JAQUES. Sing it; 'tis no mat2er how it be in tune, so it make noise 4enough. 20SONG. 6What shal2 he have that kil2'd the de2r? 6His leather skin and horns to wear. 30[The rest shal2 hear this burden:] 11Then sing him home. 6Take thou no scorn to wear the horn; 8It was a crest ere thou wast born. 11Thy father's father wore it; 11And thy father bore it. 6The horn, the horn, the lusty horn, 6Is not a thing to laugh to scorn. 19ExeuntSCENE I3.The forestEnter ROSALIND and CELIA 2ROSALIND. How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? 4And here much Orlando! 2CELIA. I war2ant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath 4ta'en his bow and ar2ows, and is gone forth- to sle2p. Lo2k, who 4comes here. 22Enter SILVIUS 2SILVIUS. My er2and is to you, fair youth; 4My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this. 4I know not the contents; but, as I gues2 4By the stern brow and waspish action 4Which she did use as she was writing of it, 4It bears an angry tenour. Pardon me, 4I am but as a guiltles2 mes2enger. 2ROSALIND. Patience herself would startle at this let2er, 4And play the swag2erer. Bear this, bear al2. 4She says I am not fair, that I lack man2ers; 6She cal2s me proud, and that she could not love me, 4Were man as rare as Phoenix. 'Od's my wil2! 4Her love is not the hare that I do hunt; 4Why writes she so to me? Wel2, shepherd, wel2, 4This is a let2er of your own device. 2SILVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents; 4Phebe did write it. 2ROSALIND. Come, come, you are a fo2l, 4And turn'd into the extremity of love. 4I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand, 4A fre2stone-colour'd hand; I verily did think 4That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands; 4She has a huswife's hand- but that's no mat2er. 4I say she never did invent this let2er: 4This is a man's invention, and his hand. 2SILVIUS. Sure, it is hers. 2ROSALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style; 4A style for chal2engers. Why, she defies me, 4Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain 4Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention, 6Such Ethiope words, blacker in their ef2ect 4Than in their countenance. Wil2 you hear the let2er? 2SILVIUS. So please you, for I never heard it yet; 4Yet heard to2 much of Phebe's cruelty. 2ROSALIND. She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes. 57[Reads] 12'Art thou god to shepherd turn'd, 12That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?' 4Can a woman rail thus? 2SILVIUS. Cal2 you this railing? 2ROSALIND. 'Why, thy godhead laid apart, 13War2'st thou with a woman's heart?' 4Did you ever hear such railing? 12'Whiles the eye of man did wo2 me, 12That could do no vengeance to me.' 6Meaning me a beast. 12'If the scorn of your bright eyne 12Have power to raise such love in mine, 12Alack, in me what strange ef2ect 12Would they work in mild aspect! 12Whiles you chid me, I did love; 12How then might your prayers move! 12He that brings this love to the 12Lit2le knows this love in me; 12And by him seal up thy mind, 12Whether that thy youth and kind 12Wil2 the faithful of2er take 12Of me and al2 that I can make; 12Or else by him my love deny, 12And then I'l2 study how to die.' 2SILVIUS. Cal2 you this chiding? 2CELIA. Alas, po2r shepherd! 2ROSALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love 4such a woman? What, to make the2 an instrument, and play false 6strains upon the2! Not to be endur'd! Wel2, go your way to her, 4for I se2 love hath made the2 tame snake, and say this to her- 4that if she love me, I charge her to love the2; if she wil2 not, 4I wil2 never have her unles2 thou entreat for her. If you be a 4true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company. 52Exit SILVIUS 25Enter OLIVER 2OLIVER. Go2d mor2ow, fair ones; pray you, if you know, 4Where in the purlieus of this forest stands 4A she2p-cote fenc'd about with olive tre2s? 2CELIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bot2om. 4The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream 4Left on your right hand brings you to the place. 4But at this hour the house doth ke2p itself; 4There's none within. 2OLIVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue, 4Then should I know you by description- 4Such garments, and such years: 'The boy is fair, 6Of female favour, and bestows himself 4Like a ripe sister; the woman low, 4And browner than her brother.' Are not you 4The owner of the house I did inquire for? 2CELIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are. 2OLIVER. Orlando doth com2end him to you both; 4And to that youth he cal2s his Rosalind 4He sends this blo2dy napkin. Are you he? 2ROSALIND. I am. What must we understand by this? 2OLIVER. Some of my shame; if you wil2 know of me 4What man I am, and how, and why, and where, 4This handkercher was stain'd. 2CELIA. I pray you, tel2 it. 2OLIVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you, 4He left a promise to return again 4Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest, 4Chewing the fo2d of swe2t and bit2er fancy, 4Lo, what befel2! He threw his eye aside, 4And mark what object did present itself. 4Under an oak, whose boughs were mos2'd with age, 6And high top bald with dry antiquity, 4A wretched rag2ed man, o'ergrown with hair, 4Lay sle2ping on his back. About his neck 4A gre2n and gilded snake had wreath'd itself, 4Who with her head nimble in threats ap2roach'd 4The opening of his mouth; but sud2enly, 4Se2ing Orlando, it unlink'd itself, 4And with indented glides did slip away 4Into a bush; under which bush's shade 4A liones2, with ud2ers al2 drawn dry, 4Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch, 4When that the sle2ping man should stir; for 'tis 4The royal disposition of that beast 4To prey on nothing that doth se2m as dead. 4This se2n, Orlando did ap2roach the man, 4And found it was his brother, his elder brother. 2CELIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother; 4And he did render him the most un2atural 4That liv'd amongst men. 2OLIVER. And wel2 he might so do, 6For wel2 I know he was un2atural. 2ROSALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there, 4Fo2d to the suck'd and hungry liones2? 2OLIVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so; 4But kindnes2, nobler ever than revenge, 4And nature, stronger than his just oc2asion, 4Made him give bat2le to the liones2, 4Who quickly fel2 before him; in which hurtling 4From miserable slumber I awak'd. 2CELIA. Are you his brother? 2ROSALIND. Was't you he rescu'd? 2CELIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kil2 him? 2OLIVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame 4To tel2 you what I was, since my conversion 4So swe2tly tastes, being the thing I am. 2ROSALIND. But for the blo2dy napkin? 2OLIVER. By and by. 4When from the first to last, betwixt us two, 4Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd, 4As how I came into that desert place- 6In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke, 4Who gave me fresh ar2ay and entertainment, 4Com2it2ing me unto my brother's love; 4Who led me instantly unto his cave, 4There strip2'd himself, and here upon his arm 4The liones2 had torn some flesh away, 4Which al2 this while had bled; and now he fainted, 4And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind. 4Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound, 4And, after some smal2 space, being strong at heart, 4He sent me hither, stranger as I am, 4To tel2 this story, that you might excuse 4His broken promise, and to give this napkin, 4Dy'd in his blo2d, unto the shepherd youth 4That he in sport doth cal2 his Rosalind. 47[ROSALIND swo2ns] 2CELIA. Why, how now, Ganymede! swe2t Ganymede! 2OLIVER. Many wil2 swo2n when they do lo2k on blo2d. 2CELIA. There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede! 2OLIVER. Lo2k, he recovers. 4ROSALIND. I would I were at home. 2CELIA. We'l2 lead you thither. 4I pray you, wil2 you take him by the arm? 2OLIVER. Be of go2d che2r, youth. You a man! 4You lack a man's heart. 2ROSALIND. I do so, I confes2 it. Ah, sir2ah, a body would think 4this was wel2 counterfeited. I pray you tel2 your brother how 4wel2 I counterfeited. Heigh-ho! 2OLIVER. This was not counterfeit; there is to2 great testimony in 4your complexion that it was a pas2ion of earnest. 2ROSALIND. Counterfeit, I as2ure you. 2OLIVER. Wel2 then, take a go2d heart and counterfeit to be a man. 2ROSALIND. So I do; but, i' faith, I should have be2n a woman by 4right. 2CELIA. Come, you lo2k paler and paler; pray you draw homewards. 4Go2d sir, go with us. 2OLIVER. That wil2 I, for I must bear answer back 4How you excuse my brother, Rosalind. 2ROSALIND. I shal2 devise something; but, I pray you, com2end my 4counterfeiting to him. Wil2 you go? 19Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. SCENE I.The forestEnter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY 2TOUCHSTONE. We shal2 find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey. 2AUDREY. Faith, the priest was go2d enough, for al2 the old 4gentleman's saying. 2TOUCHSTONE. A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext. 4But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to 4you. 2AUDREY. Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in the 4world; here comes the man you mean. 25Enter WIL2IAM 2TOUCHSTONE. It is meat and drink to me to se2 a clown. By my troth, 4we that have go2d wits have much to answer for: we shal2 be 4flouting; we can2ot hold. 2WIL2IAM. Go2d ev'n, Audrey. 2AUDREY. God ye go2d ev'n, Wil2iam. 2WIL2IAM. And go2d ev'n to you, sir. 4TOUCHSTONE. Go2d ev'n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy 4head; nay, prithe2 be cover'd. How old are you, friend? 2WIL2IAM. Five and twenty, sir. 2TOUCHSTONE. A ripe age. Is thy name Wil2iam? 2WIL2IAM. Wil2iam, sir. 2TOUCHSTONE. A fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here? 2WIL2IAM. Ay, sir, I thank God. 2TOUCHSTONE. 'Thank God.' A go2d answer. 4Art rich? 2WIL2IAM. Faith, sir, so so. 2TOUCHSTONE. 'So so' is go2d, very go2d, very excel2ent go2d; and 4yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise? 2WIL2IAM. Ay, sir, I have a pret2y wit. 2TOUCHSTONE. Why, thou say'st wel2. I do now remember a saying: 'The 4fo2l doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be 4a fo2l.' The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a 4grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning 4thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do 4love this maid? 2WIL2IAM. I do, sir. 4TOUCHSTONE. Give me your hand. Art thou learned? 2WIL2IAM. No, sir. 2TOUCHSTONE. Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a 4figure in rhetoric that drink, being pour'd out of cup into a 4glas2, by fil2ing the one doth empty the other; for al2 your 4writers do consent that ipse is he; now, you are not ipse, for I 4am he. 2WIL2IAM. Which he, sir? 2TOUCHSTONE. He, sir, that must mar2y this woman. Therefore, you 4clown, abandon- which is in the vulgar leave- the society- which 4in the bo2rish is company- of this female- which in the com2on is 4woman- which together is: abandon the society of this female; or, 4clown, thou perishest; or, to thy bet2er understanding, diest; 4or, to wit, I kil2 the2, make the2 away, translate thy life into 4death, thy liberty into bondage. I wil2 deal in poison with the2, 4or in bastinado, or in ste2l; I wil2 bandy with the2 in faction; 4wil2 o'er-run the2 with policy; I wil2 kil2 the2 a hundred and 4fifty ways; therefore tremble and depart. 2AUDREY. Do, go2d Wil2iam. 2WIL2IAM. God rest you mer2y, sir. 25Exit 28Enter CORIN 2CORIN. Our master and mistres2 se2ks you; come away, away. 2TOUCHSTONE. Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey. I at2end, I at2end. 58ExeuntSCENE I2.The forestEnter ORLANDO and OLIVER 2ORLANDO. Is't pos2ible that on so lit2le acquaintance you should 4like her? that but se2ing you should love her? and loving wo2? 4and, wo2ing, she should grant? and wil2 you persever to enjoy 4her? 2OLIVER. Neither cal2 the gid2ines2 of it in question, the poverty 4of her, the smal2 acquaintance, my sud2en wo2ing, nor her sud2en 4consenting; but say with me, I love Aliena; say with her that she 4loves me; consent with both that we may enjoy each other. It 4shal2 be to your go2d; for my father's house and al2 the revenue 4that was old Sir Rowland's wil2 I estate upon you, and here live 4and die a shepherd. 2ORLANDO. You have my consent. Let your wed2ing be to-mor2ow. 4Thither wil2 I invite the Duke and al2's contented fol2owers. Go 4you and prepare Aliena; for, lo2k you, here comes my Rosalind. 24Enter ROSALIND 4ROSALIND. God save you, brother. 2OLIVER. And you, fair sister. 29Exit 2ROSALIND. O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to se2 the2 wear 4thy heart in a scarf! 2ORLANDO. It is my arm. 2ROSALIND. I thought thy heart had be2n wounded with the claws of a 4lion. 2ORLANDO. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady. 2ROSALIND. Did your brother tel2 you how I counterfeited to swo2n 4when he show'd me your handkercher? 2ORLANDO. Ay, and greater wonders than that. 2ROSALIND. O, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never 4any thing so sud2en but the fight of two rams and Caesar's 4thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and overcame.' For your brother 4and my sister no so2ner met but they lo2k'd; no so2ner lo2k'd but 4they lov'd; no so2ner lov'd but they sigh'd; no so2ner sigh'd but 4they ask'd one another the reason; no so2ner knew the reason but 4they sought the remedy- and in these degre2s have they made pair 4of stairs to mar2iage, which they wil2 climb incontinent, or else 4be incontinent before mar2iage. They are in the very wrath of 6love, and they wil2 together. Clubs can2ot part them. 2ORLANDO. They shal2 be mar2ied to-mor2ow; and I wil2 bid the Duke 4to the nuptial. But, O, how bit2er a thing it is to lo2k into 4hap2ines2 through another man's eyes! By so much the more shal2 I 4to-mor2ow be at the height of heart-heavines2, by how much I 4shal2 think my brother hap2y in having what he wishes for. 2ROSALIND. Why, then, to-mor2ow I can2ot serve your turn for 4Rosalind? 2ORLANDO. I can live no longer by thinking. 2ROSALIND. I wil2 weary you, then, no longer with idle talking. Know 4of me then- for now I speak to some purpose- that I know you are 4a gentleman of go2d conceit. I speak not this that you should 4bear a go2d opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you 4are; neither do I labour for a greater este2m than may in some 4lit2le measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself go2d, and 4not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do 4strange things. I have, since I was thre2 year old, convers'd 4with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable. 4If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries 4it out, when your brother mar2ies Aliena shal2 you mar2y her. I 6know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not 4impos2ible to me, if it ap2ear not inconvenient to you, to set 4her before your eyes to-mor2ow, human as she is, and without any 4danger. 2ORLANDO. Speak'st thou in sober meanings? 2ROSALIND. By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I 4am a magician. Therefore put you in your best ar2ay, bid your 4friends; for if you wil2 be mar2ied to-mor2ow, you shal2; and to 4Rosalind, if you wil2. 21Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE 4Lo2k, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers. 2PHEBE. Youth, you have done me much ungentlenes2 4To show the let2er that I writ to you. 2ROSALIND. I care not if I have. It is my study 4To se2m despiteful and ungentle to you. 4You are there fol2ow'd by a faithful shepherd; 4Lo2k upon him, love him; he worships you. 2PHEBE. Go2d shepherd, tel2 this youth what 'tis to love. 4SILVIUS. It is to be al2 made of sighs and tears; 4And so am I for Phebe. 2PHEBE. And I for Ganymede. 2ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind. 2ROSALIND. And I for no woman. 2SILVIUS. It is to be al2 made of faith and service; 4And so am I for Phebe. 2PHEBE. And I for Ganymede. 2ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind. 2ROSALIND. And I for no woman. 2SILVIUS. It is to be al2 made of fantasy, 4Al2 made of pas2ion, and al2 made of wishes; 4Al2 adoration, duty, and observance, 4Al2 humblenes2, al2 patience, and impatience, 4Al2 purity, al2 trial, al2 obedience; 4And so am I for Phebe. 2PHEBE. And so am I for Ganymede. 2ORLANDO. And so am I for Rosalind. 2ROSALIND. And so am I for no woman. 2PHEBE. If this be so, why blame you me to love you? 4SILVIUS. If this be so, why blame you me to love you? 2ORLANDO. If this be so, why blame you me to love you? 2ROSALIND. Why do you speak to2, 'Why blame you me to love you?' 2ORLANDO. To her that is not here, nor doth not hear. 2ROSALIND. Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish 4wolves against the mo2n. [To SILVIUS] I wil2 help you if I can. 4[To PHEBE] I would love you if I could.- To-mor2ow me2t me al2 4together. [ To PHEBE ] I wil2 mar2y you if ever I mar2y woman, 4and I'l2 be mar2ied to-mor2ow. [To ORLANDO] I wil2 satisfy you if 4ever I satisfied man, and you shal2 be mar2ied to-mor2ow. [To 4Silvius] I wil2 content you if what pleases you contents you, and 4you shal2 be mar2ied to-mor2ow. [To ORLANDO] As you love 4Rosalind, me2t. [To SILVIUS] As you love Phebe, me2t;- and as I 4love no woman, I'l2 me2t. So, fare you wel2; I have left you 4com2ands. 2SILVIUS. I'l2 not fail, if I live. 2PHEBE. Nor I. 2ORLANDO. Nor I. 41ExeuntSCENE I3.The forestEnter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY 2TOUCHSTONE. To-mor2ow is the joyful day, Audre'y; to-mor2ow wil2 we 4be mar2ied. 2AUDREY. I do desire it with al2 my heart; and I hope it is no 4dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world. Here come 4two of the banish'd Duke's pages. 28Enter two PAGES 2FIRST PAGE. Wel2 met, honest gentleman. 2TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, wel2 met. Come sit, sit, and a song. 2SECOND PAGE. We are for you; sit i' th' mid2le. 2FIRST PAGE. Shal2 we clap into't roundly, without hawking, or 4spit2ing, or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues 4to a bad voice? 2SECOND PAGE. I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two gipsies 4on a horse. 24SONG. 8It was a lover and his las2, 10With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, 8That o'er the gre2n corn-field did pas2 10In the spring time, the only pret2y ring time, 8When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding. 8Swe2t lovers love the spring. 8Betwe2n the acres of the rye, 10With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, 8These pret2y country folks would lie, 10In the spring time, &c. 8This carol they began that hour, 10With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, 8How that a life was but a flower, 10In the spring time, &c. 8And therefore take the present time, 10With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, 10For love is crowned with the prime, 10In the spring time, &c. 2TOUCHSTONE. Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great 4mat2er in the dit2y, yet the note was very untuneable. 2FIRST PAGE. YOU are deceiv'd, sir; we kept time, we lost not our 4time. 2TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear such 4a fo2lish song. God buy you; and God mend your voices. Come, 4Audrey. 47ExeuntSCENE IV.The forestEnter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA 2DUKE SENIOR. Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy 4Can do al2 this that he hath promised? 2ORLANDO. I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not: 4As those that fear they hope, and know they fear. 15Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE 2ROSALIND. Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd: 4You say, if I bring in your Rosalind, 4You wil2 bestow her on Orlando here? 2DUKE SENIOR. That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her. 2ROSALIND. And you say you wil2 have her when I bring her? 2ORLANDO. That would I, were I of al2 kingdoms king. 2ROSALIND. You say you'l2 mar2y me, if I be wil2ing? 2PHEBE. That wil2 I, should I die the hour after. 2ROSALIND. But if you do refuse to mar2y me, 6You'l2 give yourself to this most faithful shepherd? 2PHEBE. So is the bargain. 2ROSALIND. You say that you'l2 have Phebe, if she wil2? 2SILVIUS. Though to have her and death were both one thing. 2ROSALIND. I have promis'd to make al2 this mat2er even. 4Ke2p you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter; 4You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter; 4Ke2p your word, Phebe, that you'l2 mar2y me, 4Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd; 4Ke2p your word, Silvius, that you'l2 mar2y her 4If she refuse me; and from hence I go, 4To make these doubts al2 even. 39Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA 2DUKE SENIOR. I do remember in this shepherd boy 4Some lively touches of my daughter's favour. 2ORLANDO. My lord, the first time that I ever saw him 4Methought he was a brother to your daughter. 4But, my go2d lord, this boy is forest-born, 4And hath be2n tutor'd in the rudiments 4Of many desperate studies by his uncle, 6Whom he reports to be a great magician, 4Obscured in the circle of this forest. 20Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY 2JAQUES. There is, sure, another flo2d toward, and these couples are 4coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts which 4in al2 tongues are cal2'd fo2ls. 2TOUCHSTONE. Salutation and gre2ting to you al2! 2JAQUES. Go2d my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded 4gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath be2n a 5courtier, he swears. 2TOUCHSTONE. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. 4I have trod a measure; I have flat2'red a lady; I have be2n 4politic with my friend, smo2th with mine enemy; I have undone 4thre2 tailors; I have had four quar2els, and like to have fought 4one. 2JAQUES. And how was that ta'en up? 2TOUCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and found the quar2el was upon the 4seventh cause. 4JAQUES. How seventh cause? Go2d my lord, like this fel2ow. 2DUKE SENIOR. I like him very wel2. 2TOUCHSTONE. God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I pres2 in 4here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear 4and to forswear, ac2ording as mar2iage binds and blo2d breaks. A 4po2r virgin, sir, an il2-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a 4po2r humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else wil2. Rich 4honesty dwel2s like a miser, sir, in a po2r house; as your pearl 4in your foul oyster. 2DUKE SENIOR. By my faith, he is very swift and sententious. 2TOUCHSTONE. Ac2ording to the fo2l's bolt, sir, and such dulcet 4diseases. 2JAQUES. But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quar2el on 4the seventh cause? 2TOUCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more 4se2ming, Audrey- as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain 4courtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was not 4cut wel2, he was in the mind it was. This is cal2'd the Retort 4Courteous. If I sent him word again it was not wel2 cut, he would 4send me word he cut it to please himself. This is cal2'd the Quip 6Modest. If again it was not wel2 cut, he disabled my judgment. 4This is cal2'd the Reply Churlish. If again it was not wel2 cut, 4he would answer I spake not true. This is cal2'd the Repro2f 4Valiant. If again it was not wel2 cut, he would say I lie. This 4is cal2'd the Countercheck Quar2elsome. And so to the Lie 4Circumstantial and the Lie Direct. 2JAQUES. And how oft did you say his beard was not wel2 cut? 2TOUCHSTONE. I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor 4he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd swords 4and parted. 2JAQUES. Can you nominate in order now the degre2s of the lie? 2TOUCHSTONE. O, sir, we quar2el in print by the bo2k, as you have 4bo2ks for go2d man2ers. I wil2 name you the degre2s. The first, 4the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the 4Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Repro2f Valiant; the fifth, the 4Countercheck Quar2elsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance; 4the seventh, the Lie Direct. Al2 these you may avoid but the Lie 4Direct; and you may avoid that to2 with an If. I knew when seven 4justices could not take up a quar2el; but when the parties were 4met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as: 'If you 6said so, then I said so.' And they sho2k hands, and swore 4brothers. Your If is the only peace-maker; much virtue in If. 2JAQUES. Is not this a rare fel2ow, my lord? 4He's as go2d at any thing, and yet a fo2l. 2DUKE SENIOR. He uses his fol2y like a stalking-horse, and under the 4presentation of that he sho2ts his wit: 10Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA. Stil2 MUSIC 4HYMEN. 4Then is there mirth in heaven, 14When earthly things made even 16Atone together. 14Go2d Duke, receive thy daughter; 14Hymen from heaven brought her, 16Yea, brought her hither, 14That thou mightst join her hand with his, 14Whose heart within his bosom is. 2ROSALIND. [To DUKE] To you I give myself, for I am yours. 4[To ORLANDO] To you I give myself, for I am yours. 2DUKE SENIOR. If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter. 4ORLANDO.

Let me have audience for a word or two. 4I am the second son of old Sir Rowland, 6That bring these tidings to this fair as2embly. 4Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day 4Men of great worth resorted to this forest, 4Ad2res2'd a mighty power; which were on fo2t, 4In his own conduct, purposely to take 4His brother here, and put him to the sword; 4And to the skirts of this wild wo2d he came, 4Where, me2ting with an old religious man, 4After some question with him, was converted 4Both from his enterprise and from the world; 4His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother, 4And al2 their lands restor'd to them again 4That were with him exil'd. This to be true 4I do engage my life. 2DUKE SENIOR. Welcome, young man. 4Thou of2er'st fairly to thy brothers' wed2ing: 4To one, his lands with2eld; and to the other, 4A land itself at large, a potent dukedom. 4First, in this forest let us do those ends 4That here were wel2 begun and wel2 begot; 6And after, every of this hap2y number, 4That have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us, 4Shal2 share the go2d of our returned fortune, 4Ac2ording to the measure of their states. 4Meantime, forget this new-fal2'n dignity, 4And fal2 into our rustic revelry. 4Play, music; and you brides and bridegro2ms al2, 4With measure heap'd in joy, to th' measures fal2. 2JAQUES. Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly, 4The Duke hath put on a religious life, 4And thrown into neglect the pompous court. 2JAQUES DE BOYS. He hath. 2JAQUES. To him wil2 I. Out of these convertites 4There is much mat2er to be heard and learn'd. 4[To DUKE] You to your former honour I bequeath; 4Your patience and your virtue wel2 deserves it. 4[To ORLANDO] You to a love that your true faith doth merit; 4[To OLIVER] You to your land, and love, and great al2ies 4[To SILVIUS] You to a long and wel2-deserved bed; 4[To TOUCHSTONE] And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage 6Is but for two months victual2'd.- So to your pleasures; 4I am for other than for dancing measures. 2DUKE SENIOR.

We wil2 begin these rites, 4As we do trust they'l2 end, in true delights. 4[A dance] ExeuntEPILOGUE 27EPILOGUE. 2ROSALIND. It is not the fashion to se2 the lady the epilogue; but 4it is no more unhandsome than to se2 the lord the prologue. If it 4be true that go2d wine ne2ds no bush, 'tis true that a go2d play 4ne2ds no epilogue. Yet to go2d wine they do use go2d bushes; and 4go2d plays prove the bet2er by the help of go2d epilogues. What a 4case am I in then, that am neither a go2d epilogue, nor can2ot 4insinuate with you in the behalf of a go2d play! I am not 4furnish'd like a beg2ar; therefore to beg wil2 not become me. My 4way is to conjure you; and I'l2 begin with the women. I charge 4you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of 4this play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love 4you bear to women- as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you 4hates them- that betwe2n you and the women the play may please. 4If I were a woman, I would kis2 as many of you as had beards that 4pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defied 4not; and, I am sure, as many as have go2d beards, or go2d faces, 4or swe2t breaths, wil2, for my kind of2er, when I make curtsy, 4bid me farewel2.THE END1593THE COMEDY OF ER2ORSby Wil2iam Shakespeare<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2DRAMATIS PERSONAESOLINUS, Duke of EphesusAEGEON, a merchant of SyracuseANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS twin brothers and sons toANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Aegion and AemeliaDROMIO OF EPHESUS twin brothers, and at2endants onDROMIO OF SYRACUSE the two AntipholusesBALTHAZAR, a merchantANGELO, a goldsmithFIRST MERCHANT, friend to Antipholus of SyracuseSECOND MERCHANT, to whom Angelo is a debtorPINCH, a scho2lmasterAEMILIA, wife to AEgeon; an ab2es2 at EphesusADRIANA, wife to Antipholus of EphesusLUCIANA, her sisterLUCE, servant to AdrianaA COURTEZANGaoler, Of2icers, At2endantsSCENE:Ephesus<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2THE COMEDY OF ER2ORSACT I. SCENE 1A hal2 in the DUKE'S palaceEnter the DUKE OF EPHESUS, AEGEON, the Merchantof Syracuse, GAOLER, OF2ICERS, and other AT2ENDANTSAEGEON. Proce2d, Solinus, to procure my fal2, 2And by the do2m of death end woes and al2.DUKE. Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more; 2I am not partial to infringe our laws. 2The enmity and discord which of late 2Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke 2To merchants, our wel2-dealing countrymen, 2Who, wanting guilders to rede2m their lives, 2Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their blo2ds, 2Excludes al2 pity from our threat'ning lo2ks. 2For, since the mortal and intestine jars 2'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us, 2It hath in solemn synods be2n decre2d, 2Both by the Syracusians and ourselves, 2To admit no traf2ic to our adverse towns; 2Nay, more: if any born at Ephesus 2Be se2n at any Syracusian marts and fairs; 2Again, if any Syracusian born 2Come to the bay of Ephesus-he dies, 2His go2ds confiscate to the Duke's dispose, 2Unles2 a thousand marks be levied, 2To quit the penalty and to ransom him. 2Thy substance, valued at the highest rate, 2Can2ot amount unto a hundred marks; 2Therefore by law thou art condemn'd to die.AEGEON. Yet this my comfort: when your words are done, 2My woes end likewise with the evening sun.DUKE. Wel2, Syracusian, say in brief the cause 2Why thou departed'st from thy native home, 2And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus.AEGEON. A heavier task could not have be2n impos'd 2Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable; 2Yet, that the world may witnes2 that my end 2Was wrought by nature, not by vile of2ence, 2I'l2 ut2er what my sor2ow gives me leave. 2In Syracuse was I born, and wed 2Unto a woman, hap2y but for me, 2And by me, had not our hap be2n bad. 2With her I liv'd in joy; our wealth increas'd 2By prosperous voyages I often made 2To Epidamnum; til2 my factor's death, 2And the great care of go2ds at random left, 2Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse: 2From whom my absence was not six months old, 2Before herself, almost at fainting under 2The pleasing punishment that women bear, 2Had made provision for her fol2owing me, 2And so2n and safe ar2ived where I was. 2There had she not be2n long but she became 2A joyful mother of two go2dly sons; 2And, which was strange, the one so like the other 2As could not be disdnguish'd but by names. 2That very hour, and in the self-same in2, 2A mean woman was delivered 2Of such a burden, male twins, both alike. 2Those, for their parents were exce2ding po2r, 2I bought, and brought up to at2end my sons. 2My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys, 2Made daily motions for our home return; 2Unwil2ing, I agre2d. Alas! to2 so2n 2We came aboard. 2A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd 2Before the always-wind-obeying de2p 2Gave any tragic instance of our harm: 2But longer did we not retain much hope, 2For what obscured light the heavens did grant 2Did but convey unto our fearful minds 2A doubtful war2ant of im2ediate death; 2Which though myself would gladly have embrac'd, 2Yet the inces2ant we2pings of my wife, 2We2ping before for what she saw must come, 2And piteous plainings of the pret2y babes, 2That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear, 2Forc'd me to se2k delays for them and me. 2And this it was, for other means was none: 2The sailors sought for safety by our boat, 2And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us; 2My wife, more careful for the lat2er-born, 2Had fast'ned him unto a smal2 spare mast, 2Such as sea-faring men provide for storms; 2To him one of the other twins was bound, 2Whilst I had be2n like he2dful of the other. 2The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I, 2Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd, 2Fast'ned ourselves at either end the mast, 2And, floating straight, obedient to the stream, 2Was car2ied towards Corinth, as we thought. 2At length the sun, gazing upon the earth, 2Dispers'd those vapours that of2ended us; 2And, by the benefit of his wished light, 2The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered 2Two ships from far making amain to us- 2Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this. 2But ere they came-O, let me say no more! 2Gather the sequel by that went before.DUKE. Nay, forward, old man, do not break of2 so; 2For we may pity, though not pardon the2.AEGEON. O, had the gods done so, I had not now 2Worthily term'd them merciles2 to us! 2For, ere the ships could me2t by twice five leagues, 2We were encount'red by a mighty rock, 2Which being violently borne upon, 2Our helpful ship was split2ed in the midst; 2So that, in this unjust divorce of us, 2Fortune had left to both of us alike 2What to delight in, what to sor2ow for. 2Her part, po2r soul, se2ming as burdened 2With les2er weight, but not with les2er woe, 2Was car2ied with more spe2d before the wind; 2And in our sight they thre2 were taken up 2By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought. 2At length another ship had seiz'd on us; 2And, knowing whom it was their hap to save, 2Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wreck'd guests, 2And would have reft the fishers of their prey, 2Had not their bark be2n very slow of sail; 2And therefore homeward did they bend their course. 2Thus have you heard me sever'd from my blis2, 2That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd, 2To tel2 sad stories of my own mishaps.DUKE. And, for the sake of them thou sor2owest for, 2Do me the favour to dilate at ful2 2What have befal2'n of them and the2 til2 now.AEGEON. My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care, 2At eighte2n years became inquisitive 2After his brother, and importun'd me 2That his at2endant-so his case was like, 2Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name- 2Might bear him company in the quest of him; 2Whom whilst I laboured of a love to se2, 2I hazarded the los2 of whom I lov'd. 2Five sum2ers have I spent in farthest Gre2ce, 2Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia, 2And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus; 2Hopeles2 to find, yet loath to leave unsought 2Or that or any place that harbours men. 2But here must end the story of my life; 2And hap2y were I in my timely death, 2Could al2 my travels war2ant me they live.DUKE. Haples2, Aegeon, whom the fates have mark'd 2To bear the extremity of dire mishap! 2Now, trust me, were it not against our laws, 2Against my crown, my oath, my dignity, 2Which princes, would they, may not disan2ul, 2My soul should sue as advocate for the2. 2But though thou art adjudged to the death, 2And pas2ed sentence may not be recal2'd 2But to our honour's great disparagement, 2Yet wil2 I favour the2 in what I can. 2Therefore, merchant, I'l2 limit the2 this day 2To se2k thy help by beneficial hap. 2Try al2 the friends thou hast in Ephesus; 2Beg thou, or bor2ow, to make up the sum, 2And live; if no, then thou art do2m'd to die. 2Gaoler, take him to thy custody.GAOLER.

Therefore, give out you are of Epidamnum, 2Lest that your go2ds to2 so2n be confiscate. 2This very day a Syracusian merchant 2Is ap2rehended for ar2ival here; 2And, not being able to buy out his life, 2Ac2ording to the statute of the town, 2Dies ere the weary sun set in the west. 2There is your money that I had to ke2p.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host. 2And stay there, Dromio, til2 I come to the2. 2Within this hour it wil2 be din2er-time; 2Til2 that, I'l2 view the man2ers of the town, 2Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings, 2And then return and sle2p within mine in2; 2For with long travel I am stif2 and weary. 2Get the2 away.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Many a man would take you at your word, 2And go inde2d, having so go2d a mean.<ExitANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. A trusty vil2ain, sir, that very oft, 2When I am dul2 with care and melancholy, 2Lightens my humour with his mer2y jests. 2What, wil2 you walk with me about the town, 2And then go to my in2 and dine with me?FIRST MERCHANT. I am invited, sir, to certain merchants, 2Of whom I hope to make much benefit; 2I crave your pardon. So2n at five o'clock, 2Please you, I'l2 me2t with you upon the mart, 2And afterward consort you til2 bed time. 2My present busines2 cal2s me from you now.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Farewel2 til2 then. I wil2 go lose myself, 2And wander up and down to view the city.FIRST MERCHANT. Sir, I com2end you to your own content.<Exit FIRST MERCHANTANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He that com2ends me to mine own content 2Com2ends me to the thing I can2ot get. 2I to the world am like a drop of water 2That in the ocean se2ks another drop, 2Who, fal2ing there to find his fel2ow forth, 2Unse2n, inquisitive, confounds himself. 2So I, to find a mother and a brother, 2In quest of them, unhap2y, lose myself.Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS 2Here comes the almanac of my true date. 2What now? How chance thou art return'd so so2n?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Return'd so so2n! rather ap2roach'd to2 late. 2The capon burns, the pig fal2s from the spit; 2The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bel2- 2My mistres2 made it one upon my che2k; 2She is so hot because the meat is cold, 2The meat is cold because you come not home, 2You come not home because you have no stomach, 2You have no stomach, having broke your fast; 2But we, that know what 'tis to fast and pray, 2Are penitent for your default to-day.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Stop in your wind, sir; tel2 me this, I pray: 2Where have you left the money that I gave you?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O-Sixpence that I had a Wednesday last 2To pay the sad2ler for my mistres2' crup2er? 2The sad2ler had it, sir; I kept it not.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now; 2Tel2 me, and dal2y not, where is the money? 2We being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust 2So great a charge from thine own custody?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I pray you jest, sir, as you sit at din2er. 2I from my mistres2 come to you in post; 2If I return, I shal2 be post inde2d, 2For she wil2 score your fault upon my pate. 2Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock, 2And strike you home without a mes2enger.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season; 2Reserve them til2 a mer2ier hour than this. 2Where is the gold I gave in charge to the2?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. To me, sir? Why, you gave no gold to me. 2ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your fo2lishnes2, 2And tel2 me how thou hast dispos'd thy charge.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. My charge was but to fetch you from the mart 2Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to din2er. 2My mistres2 and her sister stays for you.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me 2In what safe place you have bestow'd my money, 2Or I shal2 break that mer2y sconce of yours, 2That stands on tricks when I am undispos'd. 2Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I have some marks of yours upon my pate, 2Some of my mistres2' marks upon my shoulders, 2But not a thousand marks betwe2n you both. 2If I should pay your worship those again, 2Perchance you wil2 not bear them patiently.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy mistres2' marks! What mistres2, slave, hast thou?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Your worship's wife, my mistres2 at the Phoenix; 2She that doth fast til2 you come home to din2er, 2And prays that you wil2 hie you home to din2er.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face, 2Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.[Beats him]DROMIO OF EPHESUS. What mean you, sir? For God's sake hold your hands! 2Nay, an you wil2 not, sir, I'l2 take my he2ls.<ExitANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Upon my life, by some device or other 2The vil2ain is o'er2aught of al2 my money. 2They say this town is ful2 of cozenage; 2As, nimble jug2lers that deceive the eye, 2Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind, 2Soul-kil2ing witches that deform the body, 2Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks, 2And many such-like liberties of sin; 2If it prove so, I wil2 be gone the so2ner. 2I'l2 to the Centaur to go se2k this slave. 2I greatly fear my money is not safe.<Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT Il.

Neither my husband nor the slave return'd 2That in such haste I sent to se2k his master! 2Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.LUCIANA. Perhaps some merchant hath invited him, 2And from the mart he's somewhere gone to din2er; 2Go2d sister, let us dine, and never fret. 2A man is master of his liberty; 2Time is their master, and when they se2 time, 2They'l2 go or come. If so, be patient, sister.ADRIANA. Why should their liberty than ours be more?LUCIANA. Because their busines2 stil2 lies out o' do2r.ADRIANA. Lo2k when I serve him so, he takes it il2.LUCIANA. O, know he is the bridle of your wil2.ADRIANA. There's none but as2es wil2 be bridled so.LUCIANA. Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe. 2There's nothing situate under heaven's eye 2But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky. 2The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls, 2Are their males' subjects, and at their controls. 2Man, more divine, the master of al2 these, 2Lord of the wide world and wild wat'ry seas, 2Indu'd with intel2ectual sense and souls, 2Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls, 2Are masters to their females, and their lords; 2Then let your wil2 at2end on their ac2ords.ADRIANA. This servitude makes you to ke2p unwed.LUCIANA. Not this, but troubles of the mar2iage-bed.ADRIANA. But, were you wed2ed, you would bear some sway.LUCIANA. Ere I learn love, I'l2 practise to obey.ADRIANA. How if your husband start some other where?LUCIANA. Til2 he come home again, I would forbear.ADRIANA. Patience unmov'd! no marvel though she pause: 2They can be me2k that have no other cause. 2A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity, 2We bid be quiet when we hear it cry; 2But were we burd'ned with like weight of pain, 2As much, or more, we should ourselves complain. 2So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve the2, 2With urging helples2 patience would relieve me; 2But if thou live to se2 like right bereft, 2This fo2l-beg2'd patience in the2 wil2 be left.LUCIANA. Wel2, I wil2 mar2y one day, but to try. 2Here comes your man, now is your husband nigh.Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUSADRIANA. Say, is your tardy master now at hand?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two 2ears can witnes2.ADRIANA. Say, didst thou speak with him? Know'st thou his mind?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear. 2Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.LUCIANA. Spake he so doubtful2y thou could'st not fe2l his meaning?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he struck so plainly I could to 2wel2 fe2l his blows; and withal so doubtful2y that I could 2scarce understand them.ADRIANA. But say, I prithe2, is he coming home? 2It se2ms he hath great care to please his wife.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, mistres2, sure my master is horn-mad.ADRIANA. Horn-mad, thou vil2ain!DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I mean not cuckold-mad; 2But, sure, he is stark mad. 2When I desir'd him to come home to din2er, 2He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold. 2"Tis din2er time' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he. 2'Your meat doth burn' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he. 2'Wil2 you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he. 2'Where is the thousand marks I gave the2, vil2ain?' 2'The pig' quoth I 'is burn'd'; 'My gold!' quoth he. 2'My mistres2, sir,' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistres2; 2I know not thy mistres2; out on thy mistres2.'LUCIANA. Quoth who?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Quoth my master. 2'I know' quoth he 'no house, no wife, no mistres2.' 2So that my er2and, due unto my tongue, 2I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders; 2For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.ADRIANA. Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Go back again, and be new beaten home? 2For God's sake, send some other mes2enger.ADRIANA. Back, slave, or I wil2 break thy pate acros2.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And he wil2 bles2 that cros2 with other beating; 2Betwe2n you I shal2 have a holy head.ADRIANA. Hence, prating peasant! Fetch thy master home.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Am I so round with you, as you with me, 2That like a fo2tbal2 you do spurn me thus? 2You spurn me hence, and he wil2 spurn me hither; 2If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.<ExitLUCIANA. Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!ADRIANA. His company must do his minions grace, 2Whilst I at home starve for a mer2y lo2k. 2Hath homely age th' al2uring beauty to2k 2From my po2r che2k? Then he hath wasted it. 2Are my discourses dul2? Bar2en my wit? 2If voluble and sharp discourse be mar2'd, 2Unkindnes2 blunts it more than marble hard. 2Do their gay vestments his af2ections bait? 2That's not my fault; he's master of my state. 2What ruins are in me that can be found 2By him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground 2Of my defeatures. My decayed fair 2A sun2y lo2k of his would so2n repair. 2But, to2 unruly de2r, he breaks the pale, 2And fe2ds from home; po2r I am but his stale.LUCIANA. Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence.ADRIANA. Unfe2ling fo2ls can with such wrongs dispense. 2I know his eye doth homage otherwhere; 2Or else what lets it but he would be here? 2Sister, you know he promis'd me a chain; 2Would that alone a love he would detain, 2So he would ke2p fair quarter with his bed! 2I se2 the jewel best enamel2ed 2Wil2 lose his beauty; yet the gold bides stil2 2That others touch and, often touching, wil2 2Where gold; and no man that hath a name 2By falseho2d and cor2uption doth it shame. 2Since that my beauty can2ot please his eye, 2I'l2 we2p what's left away, and we2ping die.LUCIANA.

I did not se2 you since you sent me hence, 2Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Vil2ain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt, 2And told'st me of a mistres2 and a din2er; 2For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeas'd.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am glad to se2 you in this mer2y vein. 2What means this jest? I pray you, master, tel2 me.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Yea, dost thou je2r and flout me in the te2th? 2Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.[Beating him]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Hold, sir, for God's sake! Now your jest is earnest. 2Upon what bargain do you give it me?ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Because that I familiarly sometimes 2Do use you for my fo2l and chat with you, 2Your saucines2 wil2 jest upon my love, 2And make a com2on of my serious hours. 2When the sun shines let fo2lish gnats make sport, 2But cre2p in cran2ies when he hides his beams. 2If you wil2 jest with me, know my aspect, 2And fashion your demeanour to my lo2ks, 2Or I wil2 beat this method in your sconce.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sconce, cal2 you it? So you would 2leave bat2ering, I had rather have it a head. An you use 2these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head, and 2insconce it to2; or else I shal2 se2k my wit in my shoulders. 2But I pray, sir, why am I beaten?ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Dost thou not know?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Shal2 I tel2 you why?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say 2every why hath a wherefore.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, first for flouting me; and then wherefore, 2For urging it the second time to me.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season, 2When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason? 2Wel2, sir, I thank you.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thank me, sir! for what?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Mar2y, sir, for this something that you gave 2me for nothing.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I'l2 make you amends next, to 2give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it din2ertime?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In go2d time, sir, what's that?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Basting.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Wel2, sir, then 'twil2 be dry.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me 2another dry basting.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Wel2, sir, learn to jest in go2d time; 2there's a time for al2 things.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I durst have denied that, before you 2were so choleric.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By what rule, sir?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Mar2y, sir, by a rule as plain as the 2plain bald pate of Father Time himself.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Let's hear it.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There's no time for a man to recover 2his hair that grows bald by nature.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. May he not do it by fine and recovery?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and 2recover the lost hair of another man.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why is Time such a nig2ard of 2hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Because it is a bles2ing that he bestows 2on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath 2given them in wit.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, but there's many a man 2hath more hair than wit.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not a man of those but he hath the 2wit to lose his hair.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, thou didst conclude hairy 2men plain dealers without wit.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The plainer dealer, the so2ner lost; 2yet he loseth it in a kind of jol2ity.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For what reason?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. For two; and sound ones to2.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound I pray you.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sure ones, then.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Certain ones, then.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The one, to save the money that he spends in 2tiring; the other, that at din2er they should not drop in his 2por2idge.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would al2 this time have prov'd there 2is no time for al2 things.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Mar2y, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover 2hair lost by nature.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial, why 2there is no time to recover.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald, 2and therefore to the world's end wil2 have bald fol2owers.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion. But, 2soft, who wafts us yonder?Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA2DRIANA. Ay, ay, Antipholus, lo2k strange and frown. 2Some other mistres2 hath thy swe2t aspects; 2I am not Adriana, nor thy wife. 2The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow 2That never words were music to thine ear, 2That never object pleasing in thine eye, 2That never touch wel2 welcome to thy hand, 2That never meat swe2t-savour'd in thy taste, 2Unles2 I spake, or lo2k'd, or touch'd, or carv'd to the2. 2How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it, 2That thou art then estranged from thyself? 2Thyself I cal2 it, being strange to me, 2That, undividable, incorporate, 2Am bet2er than thy dear self's bet2er part. 2Ah, do not tear away thyself from me; 2For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fal2 2A drop of water in the breaking gulf, 2And take unmingled thence that drop again 2Without ad2ition or diminishing, 2As take from me thyself, and not me to2. 2How dearly would it touch the2 to the quick, 2Should'st thou but hear I were licentious, 2And that this body, consecrate to the2, 2By ruf2ian lust should be contaminate! 2Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me, 2And hurl the name of husband in my face, 2And tear the stain'd skin of2 my harlot-brow, 2And from my false hand cut the wed2ing-ring, 2And break it with a de2p-divorcing vow? 2I know thou canst, and therefore se2 thou do it. 2I am pos2es2'd with an adulterate blot; 2My blo2d is mingled with the crime of lust; 2For if we two be one, and thou play false, 2I do digest the poison of thy flesh, 2Being strumpeted by thy contagion. 2Ke2p then fair league and truce with thy true bed; 2I live dis-stain'd, thou undishonoured.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not: 2In Ephesus I am but two hours old, 2As strange unto your town as to your talk, 2Who, every word by al2 my wit being scan2'd, 2Wants wit in al2 one word to understand.LUCIANA. Fie, brother, how the world is chang'd with you! 2When were you wont to use my sister thus? 2She sent for you by Dromio home to din2er.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By Dromio?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By me?ADRIANA. By the2; and this thou didst return from him- 2That he did buf2et the2, and in his blows 2Denied my house for his, me for his wife.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman? 2What is the course and drift of your compact?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I, Sir? I never saw her til2 this time.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Vil2ain, thou liest; for even her very words 2Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I never spake with her in al2 my life.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, cal2 us by our names, 2Unles2 it be by inspiration?ADRIANA. How il2 agre2s it with your gravity 2To counterfeit thus gros2ly with your slave, 2Abet2ing him to thwart me in my mo2d! 2Be it my wrong you are from me exempt, 2But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt. 2Come, I wil2 fasten on this sle2ve of thine; 2Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine, 2Whose weaknes2, mar2ied to thy stronger state, 2Makes me with thy strength to com2unicate. 2If aught pos2es2 the2 from me, it is dros2, 2Usurping ivy, brier, or idle mos2; 2Who al2, for want of pruning, with intrusion 2Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme. 2What, was I mar2ied to her in my dream? 2Or sle2p I now, and think I hear al2 this? 2What er2or drives our eyes and ears amis2? 2Until I know this sure uncertainty, 2I'l2 entertain the of2er'd fal2acy.LUCIANA. Dromio, go bid the servants spread for din2er.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, for my beads! I cros2 me for sin2er. 2This is the fairy land. O spite of spites! 2We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites. 2If we obey them not, this wil2 ensue: 2They'l2 suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.LUCIANA. Why prat'st thou to thyself, and answer'st not? 2Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am transformed, master, am not I?ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think thou art in mind, and so am I.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, I am an ape.LUCIANA. If thou art chang'd to aught, 'tis to an as2.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 'Tis true; she rides me, and I long for gras2. 2'Tis so, I am an as2; else it could never be 2But I should know her as wel2 as she knows me.ADRIANA. Come, come, no longer wil2 I be a fo2l, 2To put the finger in the eye and we2p, 2Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn. 2Come, sir, to din2er. Dromio, ke2p the gate. 2Husband, I'l2 dine above with you to-day, 2And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks. 2Sir2ah, if any ask you for your master, 2Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter. 2Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter wel2.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hel2? 2Sle2ping or waking, mad or wel2-advis'd? 2Known unto these, and to myself disguis'd! 2I'l2 say as they say, and persever so, 2And in this mist at al2 adventures go.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shal2 I be porter at the gate?ADRIANA. Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.LUCIANA. Come, come, Antipholus, we dine to2 late.<Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. SCENE 1Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUSEnter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, DROMIO OF EPHESUS, ANGELO, and BALTHAZARANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go2d Signior Angelo, you must excuse us al2; 2My wife is shrewish when I ke2p not hours. 2Say that I linger'd with you at your shop 2To se2 the making of her carcanet, 2And that to-mor2ow you wil2 bring it home. 2But here's a vil2ain that would face me down 2He met me on the mart, and that I beat him, 2And charg'd him with a thousand marks in gold, 2And that I did deny my wife and house. 2Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Say what you wil2, sir, but I know what I know. 2That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show; 2If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink, 2Your own handwriting would tel2 you what I think.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I think thou art an as2.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Mar2y, so it doth ap2ear 2By the wrongs I suf2er and the blows I bear. 2I should kick, being kick'd; and being at that pas2, 2You would ke2p from my he2ls, and beware of an as2.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Y'are sad, Signior Balthazar; pray God our che2r 2May answer my go2d wil2 and your go2d welcome here.BALTHAZAR. I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish, 2A table ful2 of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.BALTHAZAR. Go2d meat, sir, is com2on; that every churl af2ords.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And welcome more com2on; for that's nothing 2but words.BALTHAZAR. Smal2 che2r and great welcome makes a mer2y feast.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Ay, to a nig2ardly host and more sparing guest. 2But though my cates be mean, take them in go2d part; 2Bet2er che2r may you have, but not with bet2er heart. 2But, soft, my do2r is lock'd; go bid them let us in.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicely, Gil2ian, Gin2!DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb, idiot, patch! 2Either get the2 from the do2r, or sit down at the hatch. 2Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou cal2'st for such store, 2When one is one to2 many? Go get the2 from the do2r.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. What patch is made our porter? 2My master stays in the stre2t.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 2[Within] 2Let him walk from whence he came, 4lest he catch cold on's fe2t.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Who talks within there? Ho, open the do2r!DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 2[Within] 2Right, sir; I'l2 tel2 you when, 4an you'l2 tel2 me wherefore.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wherefore? For my din2er; 4I have not din'd to-day.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 2[Within] 2Nor to-day here you must not; 4come again when you may.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What art thou that ke2p'st me out 4from the house I owe?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 2[Within] 2The porter for this time, 4sir, and my name is Dromio.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O Vil2ain, thou hast stol'n both mine 4of2ice and my name! 2The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame. 2If thou hadst be2n Dromio to-day in my place, 2Thou wouldst have chang'd thy face for a name, or thy name for an as2.Enter LUCE, withinLUCE. 2[Within] 2What a coil is there, Dromio? Who are those at the gate?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Let my master in, Luce.LUCE. 2[Within] 2Faith, no, he comes to2 late; 2And so tel2 your master.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O Lord, I must laugh! 2Have at you with a proverb: Shal2 I set in my staf2?LUCE. 2[Within] 2Have at you with another: that's-when? can you tel2?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 2[Within] 2If thy name be cal2ed Luce 4-Luce, thou hast answer'd him wel2.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do you hear, you minion? You'l2 let us in, I hope?LUCE. 2[Within] 2I thought to have ask'd you.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 2[Within] 2And you said no.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. SO, Come, help: wel2 struck! there was blow for blow.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou bag2age, let me in.LUCE. 2[Within] 2Can you tel2 for whose sake?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, knock the do2r hard.LUCE. 2[Within] 2Let him knock til2 it ache.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You'l2 cry for this, minion, if beat the do2r down.LUCE. 2[Within] What ne2ds al2 that, and a pair of stocks in the town?Enter ADRIANA, withinADRIANA. 2[Within] 2Who is that at the do2r, that ke2ps al2 this noise?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 2[Within] 2By my troth, your town is 4troubled with unruly boys.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Are you there, wife? You might 4have come before.ADRIANA. 2[Within] 2Your wife, sir knave! Go get you from the do2r.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. If YOU went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.ANGELO. Here is neither che2r, sir, nor welcome; we would fain have either.BALTHAZAR. In debating which was best, we shal2 part with neither.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. They stand at the do2r, master; bid them welcome hither.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is something in the wind, that we can2ot get in.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. You would say so, master, if your garments were thin. 2Your cake here is warm within; you stand here in the cold; 2It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go fetch me something; I'l2 break ope the gate.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 2[Within] 2Break any breaking here, 4and I'l2 break your knave's pate.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. A man may break a word with you, 4sir; and words are but wind; 2Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 2[Within] 2It se2ms thou want'st breaking; 4out upon the2, hind!DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Here's to2 much 'out upon the2!' pray the2 let me in.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 2[Within] 2Ay, when fowls have no 4feathers and fish have no fin.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wel2, I'l2 break in; go bor2ow me a crow.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. A crow without feather? Master, mean you so? 2For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather; 2If a crow help us in, sir2ah, we'l2 pluck a crow together.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go get the2 gone; fetch me an iron crow.BALTHAZAR. Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so! 2Herein you war against your reputation, 2And draw within the compas2 of suspect 2Th' unviolated honour of your wife. 2Once this-your long experience of her wisdom, 2Her sober virtue, years, and modesty, 2Plead on her part some cause to you unknown; 2And doubt not, sir, but she wil2 wel2 excuse 2Why at this time the do2rs are made against you. 2Be rul'd by me: depart in patience, 2And let us to the Tiger al2 to din2er; 2And, about evening, come yourself alone 2To know the reason of this strange restraint. 2If by strong hand you of2er to break in 2Now in the stir2ing pas2age of the day, 2A vulgar com2ent wil2 be made of it, 2And that sup2osed by the com2on rout 2Against your yet ungal2ed estimation 2That may with foul intrusion enter in 2And dwel2 upon your grave when you are dead; 2For slander lives upon suc2es2ion, 2For ever hous'd where it gets pos2es2ion.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You have prevail'd. I wil2 depart in quiet, 2And in despite of mirth mean to be mer2y. 2I know a wench of excel2ent discourse, 2Pret2y and wit2y; wild, and yet, to2, gentle; 2There wil2 we dine. This woman that I mean, 2My wife-but, I protest, without desert- 2Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal; 2To her wil2 we to din2er. 2[To ANGELO] 2Get you home 2And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made. 2Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine; 2For there's the house. That chain wil2 I bestow- 2Be it for nothing but to spite my wife- 2Upon mine hostes2 there; go2d sir, make haste. 2Since mine own do2rs refuse to entertain me, 2I'l2 knock elsewhere, to se2 if they'l2 disdain me.ANGELO. I'l2 me2t you at that place some hour hence.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest shal2 cost me some expense.<ExeuntSCENE 2Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUSEnter LUCIANA with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSELUCIANA. And may it be that you have quite forgot 2A husband's of2ice? Shal2, Antipholus, 2Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot? 2Shal2 love, in building, grow so ruinous? 2If you did wed my sister for her wealth, 2Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindnes2; 2Or, if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth; 2Muf2le your false love with some show of blindnes2; 2Let not my sister read it in your eye; 2Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator; 2Lo2k swe2t, speak fair, become disloyalty; 2Ap2arel vice like virtue's harbinger; 2Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted; 2Teach sin the car2iage of a holy saint; 2Be secret-false. What ne2d she be acquainted? 2What simple thief brags of his own at2aint? 2'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed 2And let her read it in thy lo2ks at board; 2Shame hath a bastard fame, wel2 managed; 2Il2 de2ds is doubled with an evil word. 2Alas, po2r women! make us but believe, 2Being compact of credit, that you love us; 2Though others have the arm, show us the sle2ve; 2We in your motion turn, and you may move us. 2Then, gentle brother, get you in again; 2Comfort my sister, che2r her, cal2 her wife. 2'Tis holy sport to be a lit2le vain 2When the swe2t breath of flat2ery conquers strife.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Swe2t mistres2-what your name is else, I know not, 2Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine- 2Les2 in your knowledge and your grace you show not 2Than our earth's wonder-more than earth, divine. 2Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak; 2Lay open to my earthy-gros2 conceit, 2Smoth'red in er2ors, fe2ble, shal2ow, weak, 2The folded meaning of your words' deceit. 2Against my soul's pure truth why labour you 2To make it wander in an unknown field? 2Are you a god? Would you create me new? 2Transform me, then, and to your pow'r I'l2 yield. 2But if that I am I, then wel2 I know 2Your we2ping sister is no wife of mine, 2Nor to her bed no homage do I owe; 2Far more, far more, to you do I decline. 2O, train me not, swe2t mermaid, with thy note, 2To drown me in thy sister's flo2d of tears. 2Sing, siren, for thyself, and I wil2 dote; 2Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs, 2And as a bed I'l2 take them, and there he; 2And in that glorious sup2osition think 2He gains by death that hath such means to die. 2Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink.LUCIANA. What, are you mad, that you do reason so?ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.LUCIANA. It is a fault that springeth from your eye.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.LUCIANA. Gaze where you should, and that wil2 clear your sight.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. As go2d to wink, swe2t love, as lo2k on night.LUCIANA. Why cal2 you me love? Cal2 my sister so.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy sister's sister.LUCIANA. That's my sister.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No; 2It is thyself, mine own self's bet2er part; 2Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart, 2My fo2d, my fortune, and my swe2t hope's aim, 2My sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim.LUCIANA. Al2 this my sister is, or else should be.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Cal2 thyself sister, swe2t, for I am the2; 2The2 wil2 I love, and with the2 lead my life; 2Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife. 2Give me thy hand.LUCIANA. O, soft, sir, hold you stil2; 2I'l2 fetch my sister to get her go2d wil2.<Exit LUCIANAEnter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, how now, Dromio! Where run'st thou 2so fast?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio? 2Am I your man? Am I myself?ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art Dromio, thou art my 2man, thou art thyself.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am an as2, I am a woman's man, and besides 2myself.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What woman's man, and how besides thyself?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Mar2y, sir, besides myself, I am due 2to a woman-one that claims me, one that haunts me, one 2that wil2 have me.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What claim lays she to the2?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Mar2y, sir, such claim as you would 2lay to your horse; and she would have me as a beast: not 2that, I being a beast, she would have me; but that she, 2being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A very reverent body; ay, such a one 2as a man may not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' 2I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a 2wondrous fat mar2iage.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat mar2iage?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Mar2y, sir, she's the kitchen-wench, 2and al2 grease; and I know not what use to put her to but 2to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light. 2I war2ant, her rags and the tal2ow in them wil2 burn 2Poland winter. If she lives til2 do2msday, she'l2 burn 2we2k longer than the whole world.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Swart, like my shoe; but her face 2nothing like so clean kept; for why, she sweats, a man may 2go over shoes in the grime of it.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That's a fault that water wil2 mend.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flo2d 2could not do it.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What's her name?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nel2, sir; but her name and thre2 2quarters, that's an el2 and thre2 quarters, wil2 not measure 2her from hip to hip.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she bears some breadth?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No longer from head to fo2t than 2from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find 2out countries in her.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body stands Ireland?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Mar2y, sir, in her but2ocks; I found it out by 2the bogs.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I found it by the bar2en2es2, hard in 2the palm of the hand.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. In her forehead, arm'd and reverted, 2making war against her heir.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I lo2k'd for the chalky clif2s, but I 2could find no whitenes2 in them; but I gues2 it sto2d in her 2chin, by the salt rheum that ran betwe2n France and it.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot in 2her breath.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, sir, upon her nose, an o'er embel2ished with 2rubies, carbuncles, sap2hires, declining their rich aspect to the 2hot breath of Spain; who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be 2bal2ast at her nose.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where sto2d Belgia, the Netherlands?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, Sir, I did not lo2k so low. To 2conclude: this drudge or diviner laid claim to me; cal2'd me 2Dromio; swore I was as2ur'd to her; told me what privy 2marks I had about me, as, the mark of my shoulder, the 2mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I, 2amaz'd, ran from her as a witch. 2And, I think, if my breast had not be2n made of faith, 4and my heart of ste2l, 2She had transform'd me to a curtal dog, and made me turn i' th' whe2l.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go hie the2 presently post to the road; 2An if the wind blow any way from shore, 2I wil2 not harbour in this town to-night. 2If any bark put forth, come to the mart, 2Where I wil2 walk til2 thou return to me. 2If every one knows us, and we know none, 2'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. As from a bear a man would run for life, 2So fly I from her that would be my wife.<ExitANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's none but witches do inhabit here, 2And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence. 2She that doth cal2 me husband, even my soul 2Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister, 2Pos2es2'd with such a gentle sovereign grace, 2Of such enchanting presence and discourse, 2Hath almost made me traitor to myself; 2But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong, 2I'l2 stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.Enter ANGELO with the chainANGELO. Master Antipholus!ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.ANGELO. I know it wel2, sir. Lo, here is the chain. 2I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine; 2The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your wil2 that I shal2 do with this?ANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.ANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have. 2Go home with it, and please your wife withal; 2And so2n at sup2er-time I'l2 visit you, 2And then receive my money for the chain.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now, 2For fear you ne'er se2 chain nor money more.ANGELO. You are a mer2y man, sir; fare you wel2.<ExitANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this can2ot tel2: 2But this I think, there's no man is so vain 2That would refuse so fair an of2er'd chain. 2I se2 a man here ne2ds not live by shifts, 2When in the stre2ts he me2ts such golden gifts. 2I'l2 to the mart, and there for Dromio stay; 2If any ship put out, then straight away.<Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE 1A public placeEnter SECOND MERCHANT, ANGELO, and an OF2ICERSECOND MERCHANT. You know since Pentecost the sum is due, 2And since I have not much importun'd you; 2Nor now I had not, but that I am bound 2To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage. 2Therefore make present satisfaction, 2Or I'l2 at2ach you by this of2icer.ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you 2Is growing to me by Antipholus; 2And in the instant that I met with you 2He had of me a chain; at five o'clock 2I shal2 receive the money for the same. 2Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house, 2I wil2 discharge my bond, and thank you to2.Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, and DROMIO OF EPHESUS, from the COURTEZAN'SOF2ICER. That labour may you save; se2 where he comes.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou 2And buy a rope's end; that wil2 I bestow 2Among my wife and her confederates, 2For locking me out of my do2rs by day. 2But, soft, I se2 the goldsmith. Get the2 gone; 2Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I buy a thousand pound a year; I buy a rope.<Exit DROMIOANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is wel2 holp up that trusts to you! 2I promised your presence and the chain; 2But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me. 2Belike you thought our love would last to2 long, 2If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.ANGELO. Saving your mer2y humour, here's the note 2How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat, 2The finenes2 of the gold, and chargeful fashion, 2Which doth amount to thre2 od2 ducats more 2Than I stand debted to this gentleman. 2I pray you se2 him presently discharg'd, 2For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money; 2Besides, I have some busines2 in the town. 2Go2d signior, take the stranger to my house, 2And with you take the chain, and bid my wife 2Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof. 2Perchance I wil2 be there as so2n as you.ANGELO. Then you wil2 bring the chain to her yourself?ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.ANGELO. Wel2, sir, I wil2. Have you the chain about you?ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have; 2Or else you may return without your money.ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain; 2Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman, 2And I, to blame, have held him here to2 long.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go2d Lord! you use this dal2iance to excuse 2Your breach of promise to the Porpentine; 2I should have chid you for not bringing it, 2But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.SECOND MERCHANT. The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the chain!ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now. 2Either send the chain or send by me some token.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of breath! 2Come, where's the chain? I pray you let me se2 it.SECOND MERCHANT. My busines2 can2ot bro2k this dal2iance. 2Go2d sir, say whe'r you'l2 answer me or no; 2If not, I'l2 leave him to the of2icer.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you! What should I answer you?ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none til2 I receive the chain.ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to say so.ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it. 2Consider how it stands upon my credit.SECOND MERCHANT. Wel2, of2icer, ar2est him at my suit.OF2ICER. I do; and charge you in the Duke's name to obey me.ANGELO. This touches me in reputation. 2Either consent to pay this sum for me, 2Or I at2ach you by this of2icer.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay the2 that I never had! 2Ar2est me, fo2lish fel2ow, if thou dar'st.ANGELO. Here is thy fe2; ar2est him, of2icer. 2I would not spare my brother in this case, 2If he should scorn me so ap2arently.OF2ICER. I do ar2est you, sir; you hear the suit.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey the2 til2 I give the2 bail. 2But, sir2ah, you shal2 buy this sport as dear 2As al2 the metal in your shop wil2 answer.ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shal2 have law in Ephesus, 2To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, from the bayDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, there's a bark of Epidamnum 2That stays but til2 her owner comes aboard, 2And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir, 2I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought 2The oil, the balsamum, and aqua-vitx. 2The ship is in her trim; the mer2y wind 2Blows fair from land; they stay for nought at an 2But for their owner, master, and yourself.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou pe2vish she2p, 2What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope; 2And told the2 to what purpose and what end.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. YOU sent me for a rope's end as so2n- 2You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Wil2 debate this mat2er at more leisure, 2And teach your ears to list me with more he2d. 2To Adriana, vil2ain, hie the2 straight; 2Give her this key, and tel2 her in the desk 2That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry 2There is a purse of ducats; let her send it. 2Tel2 her I am ar2ested in the stre2t, 2And that shal2 bail me; hie the2, slave, be gone. 2On, of2icer, to prison til2 it come.<Exeunt al2 but DROMIODROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

Ah, Luciana, did he tempt the2 so? 2Might'st thou perceive austerely in his eye 2That he did plead in earnest? Yea or no? 2Lo2k'd he or red or pale, or sad or mer2ily? 2What observation mad'st thou in this case 2Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?LUCIANA. First he denied you had in him no right.ADRIANA. He meant he did me none-the more my spite.LUCIANA. Then swore he that he was a stranger here.ADRIANA. And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.LUCIANA. Then pleaded I for you.ADRIANA. And what said he?LUCIANA. That love I beg2'd for you he beg2'd of me.ADRIANA. With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?LUCIANA. With words that in an honest suit might move. 2First he did praise my beauty, then my spe2ch.ADRIANA. Didst speak him fair?LUCIANA. Have patience, I bese2ch.ADRIANA. I can2ot, nor I wil2 not hold me stil2; 2My tongue, though not my heart, shal2 have his wil2. 2He is deformed, cro2ked, old, and sere, 2Il2-fac'd, worse bodied, shapeles2 everywhere; 2Vicious, ungentle, fo2lish, blunt, unkind; 2Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.LUCIANA. Who would be jealous then of such a one? 2No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.ADRIANA. Ah, but I think him bet2er than I say, 2And yet would herein others' eyes were worse. 2Far from her nest the lapwing cries away; 2My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Here go-the desk, the purse. Swe2t 2now, make haste.LUCIANA. How hast thou lost thy breath?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By run2ing fast.ADRIANA. Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he wel2?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hel2. 2A devil in an everlasting garment hath him; 2One whose hard heart is but2on'd up with ste2l; 2A fiend, a fairy, pitiles2 and rough; 2A wolf, nay worse, a fel2ow al2 in buf2; 2A back-friend, a shoulder-clap2er, one that countermands 2The pas2ages of al2eys, cre2ks, and nar2ow lands; 2A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-fo2t wel2; 2One that, before the Judgment, car2ies po2r souls to hel2.ADRIANA. Why, man, what is the mat2er?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I do not know the mat2er; he is rested on the case.ADRIANA. What, is he ar2ested? Tel2 me, at whose suit?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I know not at whose suit he is ar2ested wel2; 2But he's in a suit of buf2 which 'rested him, that can I tel2. 2Wil2 you send him, mistres2, redemption, the money in his desk?ADRIANA. Go fetch it, sister. 2[Exit LUCIANA] 2This I wonder at: 2Thus he unknown to me should be in debt. 2Tel2 me, was he ar2ested on a band?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. on a band, but on a stronger thing, 2A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?ADRIANA. What, the chain?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, no, the bel2; 'tis time that I were gone. 2It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.ADRIANA. The hours come back! That did I never hear.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O yes. If any hour me2t a sergeant, 4'a turns back for very fear.ADRIANA. As if Time were in debt! How fondly dost thou reason!DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Time is a very bankrupt, and owes 4more than he's worth to season. 2Nay, he's a thief to2: have you not heard men say 2That Time comes stealing on by night and day? 2If 'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way, 2Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?Re-enter LUCIANA with a purseADRIANA. Go, Dromio, there's the money; bear it straight, 2And bring thy master home im2ediately. 2Come, sister; I am pres2'd down with conceit- 2Conceit, my comfort and my injury.<ExeuntSCENE 3The martEnter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSEANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's not a man I me2t but doth salute me 2As if I were their wel2-acquainted friend; 2And every one doth cal2 me by my name. 2Some tender money to me, some invite me, 2Some other give me thanks for kindnes2es, 2Some of2er me com2odities to buy; 2Even now a tailor cal2'd me in his shop, 2And show'd me silks that he had bought for me, 2And therewithal to2k measure of my body. 2Sure, these are but imaginary wiles, 2And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSEDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, here's the gold you sent me 2for. What, have you got the picture of old Adam new-ap2arel2'd?ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not that Adam that kept the Paradise, 2but that Adam that ke2ps the prison; he that goes in the 2calf's skin that was kil2'd for the Prodigal; he that came behind 2you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand the2 not.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No? Why, 'tis a plain case: he that 2went, like a bas2-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir, 2that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob, and rest 2them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men, and give 2them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more 2exploits with his mace than a mor2is-pike.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean'st an of2icer?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band; 2that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band; on 2that thinks a man always going to bed, and says 'God give 2you go2d rest!'ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Wel2, sir, there rest in your fo2lery. Is 2there any ship puts forth to-night? May we be gone?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Why, sir, I brought you word an 2hour since that the bark Expedition put forth to-night; and 2then were you hind'red by the sergeant, to tar2y for the 2boy Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fel2ow is distract, and so am I; 2And here we wander in il2usions. 2Some bles2ed power deliver us from hence!Enter a COURTEZANCOURTEZAN. Wel2 met, wel2 met, Master Antipholus. 2I se2, sir, you have found the goldsmith now. 2Is that the chain you promis'd me to-day?ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge the2, tempt me not.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, is this Mistres2 Satan?ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's 2dam, and here she comes in the habit of a light wench; and 2thereof comes that the wenches say 'God damn me!' That's 2as much to say 'God make me a light wench!' It is writ2en 2they ap2ear to men like angels of light; light is an ef2ect 2of fire, and fire wil2 burn; ergo, light wenches wil2 burn. 2Come not near her.COURTEZAN. Your man and you are marvel2ous mer2y, sir. 2Wil2 you go with me? We'l2 mend our din2er here.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, if you do, expect spo2n-meat, 2or bespeak a long spo2n.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Mar2y, he must have a long spo2n 2that must eat with the devil.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tel2'st thou me of sup2ing? 2Thou art, as you are al2, a sorceres2; 2I conjure the2 to leave me and be gone.COURTEZAN. Give me the ring of mine you had at din2er, 2Or, for my diamond, the chain you promis'd, 2And I'l2 be gone, sir, and not trouble you.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail, 2A rush, a hair, a drop of blo2d, a pin, 2A nut, a cher2y-stone; 2But she, more covetous, would have a chain. 2Master, be wise; an if you give it her, 2The devil wil2 shake her chain, and fright us with it.COURTEZAN. I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain; 2I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 'Fly pride' says the peacock. Mistres2, that you know.<Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSECOURTEZAN. Now, out of doubt, Antipholus is mad, 2Else would he never so demean himself. 2A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats, 2And for the same he promis'd me a chain; 2Both one and other he denies me now. 2The reason that I gather he is mad, 2Besides this present instance of his rage, 2Is a mad tale he told to-day at din2er 2Of his own do2rs being shut against his entrance. 2Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits, 2On purpose shut the do2rs against his way. 2My way is now to hie home to his house, 2And tel2 his wife that, being lunatic, 2He rush'd into my house and to2k perforce 2My ring away. This course I fit2est cho2se, 2For forty ducats is to2 much to lose.<ExitSCENE 4A stre2tEnter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS with the OF2ICERANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.

Have you that I sent you for?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Here's that, I war2ant you, wil2 pay them al2.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, vil2ain, for rope?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I'l2 serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid the2 hie the2 home?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I 2return'd.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I wil2 welcome you.[Beating him]OF2ICER. Go2d sir, be patient.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in 2adversity.OF2ICER. Go2d now, hold thy tongue.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseles2 vil2ain!DROMIO OF EPHESUS.

I am an as2 inde2d; you may prove it 2by my long 'ears. I have served him from the hour of my 2nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for 2my service but blows. When I am cold he heats me with 2beating; when I am warm he co2ls me with beating. I am 2wak'd with it when I sle2p; rais'd with it when I sit; driven 2out of do2rs with it when I go from home; welcom'd home 2with it when I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders as 2beg2ar wont her brat; and I think, when he hath lam'd me, 2I shal2 beg with it from do2r to do2r.Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and a SCHO2LMASTERcal2'd PINCHANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Mistres2, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or 2rather, to prophesy like the par2ot, 'Beware the rope's-end.'ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou stil2 talk?[Beating him]COURTEZAN. How say you now? Is not your husband mad?ADRIANA. His incivility confirms no les2. 2Go2d Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer: 2Establish him in his true sense again, 2And I wil2 please you what you wil2 demand.LUCIANA.

Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.ADRIANA. O, that thou wert not, po2r distres2ed soul!ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers? 2Did this companion with the saf2ron face 2Revel and feast it at my house to-day, 2Whilst upon me the guilty do2rs were shut, 2And I denied to enter in my house?ADRIANA. O husband, God doth know you din'd at home, 2Where would you had remain'd until this time, 2Fre2 from these slanders and this open shame!ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din'd at home! Thou vil2ain, what sayest thou?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, So2th to say, you did not dine at home.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my do2rs lock'd up and I shut out?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Perdie, your do2rs were lock'd and you shut out.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sans fable, she herself revil'd you there.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. In verity, you did. My bones bear witnes2, 2That since have felt the vigour of his rage.ADRIANA. Is't go2d to so2the him in these contraries?PINCH. It is no shame; the fel2ow finds his vein, 2And, yielding to him, humours wel2 his frenzy.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to ar2est me.ADRIANA. Alas, I sent you money to rede2m you, 2By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Money by me! Heart and go2dwil2 you might, 2But surely, master, not a rag of money.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats?ADRIANA. He came to me, and I deliver'd it.LUCIANA. And I am witnes2 with her that she did.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. God and the rope-maker bear me witnes2 2That I was sent for nothing but a rope!PINCH. Mistres2, both man and master is pos2es2'd; 2I know it by their pale and deadly lo2ks. 2They must be bound, and laid in some dark ro2m.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day? 2And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?ADRIANA. I did not, gentle husband, lock the2 forth.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And, gentle master, I receiv'd no gold; 2But I confes2, sir, that we were lock'd out.ADRIANA. Dis2embling vil2ain, thou speak'st false in both.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dis2embling harlot, thou art false in al2, 2And art confederate with a damned pack 2To make a loathsome abject scorn of me; 2But with these nails I'l2 pluck out these false eyes 2That would behold in me this shameful sport.ADRIANA.

I wil2 discharge the2 ere I go from the2; 2Bear me forthwith unto his creditor, 2And, knowing how the debt grows, I wil2 pay it. 2Go2d Master Doctor, se2 him safe convey'd 2Home to my house. O most unhap2y day!ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhap2y strumpet!DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, I am here ent'red in bond for you.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on the2, vil2ian! Wherefore 2dost thou mad me?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Wil2 you be bound for nothing? 2Be mad, go2d master; cry 'The devil!'LUCIANA. God help, po2r souls, how idly do they talk!ADRIANA. Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.<Exeunt al2 but ADRIANA, LUCIANA, OF2ICERS, and COURTEZAN 2Say now, whose suit is he ar2ested at?OF2ICER. One Angelo, a goldsmith; do you know him?ADRIANA. I know the man. What is the sum he owes?OF2ICER. Two hundred ducats.ADRIANA. Say, how grows it due?OF2ICER. Due for a chain your husband had of him.ADRIANA. He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.COURTEZAN. When as your husband, al2 in rage, to-day 2Came to my house, and to2k away my ring- 2The ring I saw upon his finger now- 2Straight after did I me2t him with a chain.ADRIANA. It may be so, but I did never se2 it. 2Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is; 2I long to know the truth hereof at large.Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, with his rapier drawn, andDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.LUCIANA.

Faith, stay here this night; they wil2 2surely do us no harm; you saw they speak us fair, give us 2gold; methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for 2the mountain of mad flesh that claims mar2iage of me, 2could find in my heart to stay here stil2 and turn witch.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.

SCENE 1A stre2t before a prioryEnter SECOND MERCHANT and ANGELOANGELO. I am sor2y, sir, that I have hind'red you; 2But I protest he had the chain of me, 2Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.SECOND MERCHANT. How is the man este2m'd here in the city?ANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir, 2Of credit infinite, highly belov'd, 2Second to none that lives here in the city; 2His word might bear my wealth at any time.SECOND MERCHANT. Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSEANGELO. 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck 2Which he forswore most monstrously to have. 2Go2d sir, draw near to me, I'l2 speak to him. 2Signior Andpholus, I wonder much 2That you would put me to this shame and trouble; 2And, not without some scandal to yourself, 2With circumstance and oaths so to deny 2This chain, which now you wear so openly. 2Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment, 2You have done wrong to this my honest friend; 2Who, but for staying on our controversy, 2Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day. 2This chain you had of me; can you deny it?ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had; I never did deny it.SECOND MERCHANT. Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it to2.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?SECOND MERCHANT. These ears of mine, thou know'st, did hear the2. 2Fie on the2, wretch! 'tis pity that thou liv'st 2To walk where any honest men resort.ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a vil2ain to impeach me thus; 2I'l2 prove mine honour and mine honesty 2Against the2 presently, if thou dar'st stand.SECOND MERCHANT. I dare, and do defy the2 for a vil2ain.[They draw]Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and OTHERSADRIANA. Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! He is mad. 2Some get within him, take his sword away; 2Bind Dromio to2, and bear them to my house.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Run, master, run; for God's sake take a house. 2This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd.<Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE to the prioryEnter the LADY AB2ES2AB2ES2. Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?ADRIANA. To fetch my po2r distracted husband hence. 2Let us come in, that we may bind him fast, 2And bear him home for his recovery.ANGELO. I knew he was not in his perfect wits.SECOND MERCHANT. I am sor2y now that I did draw on him.AB2ES2. How long hath this pos2es2ion held the man?ADRIANA. This we2k he hath be2n heavy, sour, sad, 2And much dif2erent from the man he was; 2But til2 this afterno2n his pas2ion 2Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.AB2ES2. Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea? 2Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye 2Stray'd his af2ection in unlawful love? 2A sin prevailing much in youthful men 2Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing. 2Which of these sor2ows is he subject to?ADRIANA. To none of these, except it be the last; 2Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.AB2ES2. You should for that have reprehended him.ADRIANA. Why, so I did.AB2ES2. Ay, but not rough enough.ADRIANA. As roughly as my modesty would let me.AB2ES2. Haply in private.ADRIANA. And in as2emblies to2.AB2ES2. Ay, but not enough.ADRIANA. It was the copy of our conference. 2In bed, he slept not for my urging it; 2At board, he fed not for my urging it; 2Alone, it was the subject of my theme; 2In company, I often glanced it; 2Stil2 did I tel2 him it was vile and bad.AB2ES2. And thereof came it that the man was mad. 2The venom clamours of a jealous woman 2Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's to2th. 2It se2ms his sle2ps were hind'red by thy railing, 2And thereof comes it that his head is light. 2Thou say'st his meat was sauc'd with thy upbraidings: 2Unquiet meals make il2 digestions; 2Thereof the raging fire of fever bred; 2And what's a fever but a fit of madnes2? 2Thou say'st his sports were hind'red by thy brawls. 2Swe2t recreation bar2'd, what doth ensue 2But mo2dy and dul2 melancholy, 2Kinsman to grim and comfortles2 despair, 2And at her he2ls a huge infectious tro2p 2Of pale distemperatures and foes to life? 2In fo2d, in sport, and life-preserving rest, 2To be disturb'd would mad or man or beast. 2The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits 2Hath scar'd thy husband from the use of wits.LUCIANA. She never reprehended him but mildly, 2When he demean'd himself rough, rude, and wildly. 2Why bear you these rebukes, and answer not?ADRIANA. She did betray me to my own repro2f. 2Go2d people, enter, and lay hold on him.AB2ES2. No, not a creature enters in my house.ADRIANA. Then let your servants bring my husband forth.AB2ES2. Neither; he to2k this place for sanctuary, 2And it shal2 privilege him from your hands 2Til2 I have brought him to his wits again, 2Or lose my labour in as2aying it.ADRIANA. I wil2 at2end my husband, be his nurse, 2Diet his sicknes2, for it is my of2ice, 2And wil2 have no at2orney but myself; 2And therefore let me have him home with me.AB2ES2. Be patient; for I wil2 not let him stir 2Til2 I have us'd the ap2roved means I have, 2With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers, 2To make of him a formal man again. 2It is a branch and parcel of mine oath, 2A charitable duty of my order; 2Therefore depart, and leave him here with me.ADRIANA. I wil2 not hence and leave my husband here; 2And il2 it doth bese2m your holines2 2To separate the husband and the wife.AB2ES2. Be quiet, and depart; thou shalt not have him.<ExitLUCIANA. Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.ADRIANA. Come, go; I wil2 fal2 prostrate at his fe2t, 2And never rise until my tears and prayers 2Have won his Grace to come in person hither 2And take perforce my husband from the Ab2es2.SECOND MERCHANT. By this, I think, the dial points at five; 2Anon, I'm sure, the Duke himself in person 2Comes this way to the melancholy vale, 2The place of death and sor2y execution, 2Behind the ditches of the ab2ey here.ANGELO. Upon what cause?SECOND MERCHANT. To se2 a reverend Syracusian merchant, 2Who put unluckily into this bay 2Against the laws and statutes of this town, 2Beheaded publicly for his of2ence.ANGELO. Se2 where they come; we wil2 behold his death.LUCIANA. Kne2l to the Duke before he pas2 the ab2ey.Enter the DUKE, at2ended; AEGEON, bareheaded;with the HEADSMAN and other OF2ICERSDUKE. Yet once again proclaim it publicly, 2If any friend wil2 pay the sum for him, 2He shal2 not die; so much we tender him.ADRIANA. Justice, most sacred Duke, against the Ab2es2!DUKE. She is a virtuous and a reverend lady; 2It can2ot be that she hath done the2 wrong.ADRIANA. May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband, 2Who I made lord of me and al2 I had 2At your important let2ers-this il2 day 2A most outrageous fit of madnes2 to2k him, 2That desp'rately he hur2ied through the stre2t, 2With him his bondman al2 as mad as he, 2Doing displeasure to the citizens 2By rushing in their houses, bearing thence 2Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like. 2Once did I get him bound and sent him home, 2Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went, 2That here and there his fury had com2it2ed. 2Anon, I wot not by what strong escape, 2He broke from those that had the guard of him, 2And with his mad at2endant and himself, 2Each one with ireful pas2ion, with drawn swords, 2Met us again and, madly bent on us, 2Chas'd us away; til2, raising of more aid, 2We came again to bind them. Then they fled 2Into this ab2ey, whither we pursu'd them; 2And here the Ab2es2 shuts the gates on us, 2And wil2 not suf2er us to fetch him out, 2Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence. 2Therefore, most gracious Duke, with thy com2and 2Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.DUKE. Long since thy husband serv'd me in my wars, 2And I to the2 engag'd a prince's word, 2When thou didst make him master of thy bed, 2To do him al2 the grace and go2d I could. 2Go, some of you, knock at the ab2ey gate, 2And bid the Lady Ab2es2 come to me, 2I wil2 determine this before I stir.Enter a MES2ENGERMES2ENGER. O mistres2, mistres2, shift and save yourself! 2My master and his man are both broke lo2se, 2Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor, 2Whose beard they have sing'd of2 with brands of fire; 2And ever, as it blaz'd, they threw on him 2Great pails of pud2led mire to quench the hair. 2My master preaches patience to him, and the while 2His man with scis2ors nicks him like a fo2l; 2And sure, unles2 you send some present help, 2Betwe2n them they wil2 kil2 the conjurer.ADRIANA. Peace, fo2l! thy master and his man are here, 2And that is false thou dost report to us.MES2ENGER. Mistres2, upon my life, I tel2 you true; 2I have not breath'd almost since I did se2 it. 2He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you, 2To scorch your face, and to disfigure you.[Cry within] 2Hark, hark, I hear him, mistres2; fly, be gone!DUKE. Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds.ADRIANA. Ay me, it is my husband! Witnes2 you 2That he is borne about invisible. 2Even now we hous'd him in the ab2ey here, 2And now he's there, past thought of human reason.Enter ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS and DROMIO OFEPHESUSANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, grant me justice! 2Even for the service that long since I did the2, 2When I bestrid the2 in the wars, and to2k 2De2p scars to save thy life; even for the blo2d 2That then I lost for the2, now grant me justice.AEGEON. Unles2 the fear of death doth make me dote, 2I se2 my son Antipholus, and Dromio.ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, swe2t Prince, against that woman there! 2She whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife, 2That hath abused and dishonoured me 2Even in the strength and height of injury. 2Beyond imagination is the wrong 2That she this day hath shameles2 thrown on me.DUKE. Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the do2rs upon me, 2While she with harlots feasted in my house.DUKE. A grievous fault. Say, woman, didst thou so?ADRIANA. No, my go2d lord. Myself, he, and my sister, 2To-day did dine together. So befal2 my soul 2As this is false he burdens me withal!LUCIANA. Ne'er may I lo2k on day nor sle2p on night 2But she tel2s to your Highnes2 simple truth!ANGELO. O peflur'd woman! They are both forsworn. 2In this the madman justly chargeth them.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say; 2Neither disturbed with the ef2ect of wine, 2Nor heady-rash, provok'd with raging ire, 2Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad. 2This woman lock'd me out this day from din2er; 2That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her, 2Could witnes2 it, for he was with me then; 2Who parted with me to go fetch a chain, 2Promising to bring it to the Porpentine, 2Where Balthazar and I did dine together. 2Our din2er done, and he not coming thither, 2I went to se2k him. In the stre2t I met him, 2And in his company that gentleman. 2There did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down 2That I this day of him receiv'd the chain, 2Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which 2He did ar2est me with an of2icer. 2I did obey, and sent my peasant home 2For certain ducats; he with none return'd. 2Then fairly I bespoke the of2icer 2To go in person with me to my house. 2By th' way we met my wife, her sister, and a rab2le more 2Of vile confederates. Along with them 2They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac'd vil2ain, 2A mere anatomy, a mountebank, 2A threadbare jug2ler, and a fortune-tel2er, 2A ne2dy, hol2ow-ey'd, sharp-lo2king wretch, 2A living dead man. This pernicious slave, 2Forso2th, to2k on him as a conjurer, 2And gazing in mine eyes, fe2ling my pulse, 2And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me, 2Cries out I was pos2es2'd. Then al2 together 2They fel2 upon me, bound me, bore me thence, 2And in a dark and dankish vault at home 2There left me and my man, both bound together; 2Til2, gnawing with my te2th my bonds in sunder, 2I gain'd my fre2dom, and im2ediately 2Ran hither to your Grace; whom I bese2ch 2To give me ample satisfaction 2For these de2p shames and great indignities.ANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witnes2 with him, 2That he din'd not at home, but was lock'd out.DUKE. But had he such a chain of the2, or no?ANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here, 2These people saw the chain about his neck.SECOND MERCHANT. Besides, I wil2 be sworn these ears of mine 2Heard you confes2 you had the chain of him, 2After you first forswore it on the mart; 2And thereupon I drew my sword on you, 2And then you fled into this ab2ey here, 2From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never came within these ab2ey wal2s, 2Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me; 2I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven! 2And this is false you burden me withal.DUKE. Why, what an intricate impeach is this! 2I think you al2 have drunk of Circe's cup. 2If here you hous'd him, here he would have be2n; 2If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly. 2You say he din'd at home: the goldsmith here 2Denies that saying. Sir2ah, what say you?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, he din'd with her there, at the Porpentine.COURTEZAN. He did; and from my finger snatch'd that ring.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.DUKE. Saw'st thou him enter at the ab2ey here?COURTEZAN. As sure, my liege, as I do se2 your Grace.DUKE. Why, this is strange. Go cal2 the Ab2es2 hither. 2I think you are al2 mated or stark mad.<Exit one to the AB2ES2AEGEON. Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word: 2Haply I se2 a friend wil2 save my life 2And pay the sum that may deliver me.DUKE. Speak fre2ly, Syracusian, what thou wilt.AEGEON. Is not your name, sir, cal2'd Antipholus? 2And is not that your bondman Dromio?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Within this hour I was his bondman, sir, 2But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords 2Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.AEGEON. I am sure you both of you remember me.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you; 2For lately we were bound as you are now. 2You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?AEGEON. Why lo2k you strange on me? You know me wel2.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw you in my life til2 now.AEGEON. O! grief hath chang'd me since you saw me last; 2And careful hours with time's deformed hand 2Have writ2en strange defeatures in my face. 2But tel2 me yet, dost thou not know my voice?ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Neither.AEGEON. Dromio, nor thou?DROMIO OF EPHESUS. No, trust me, sir, nor I.AEGEON. I am sure thou dost.DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and 2whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him.AEGEON. Not know my voice! O time's extremity, 2Hast thou so crack'd and split2ed my po2r tongue 2In seven short years that here my only son 2Knows not my fe2ble key of untun'd cares? 2Though now this grained face of mine be hid 2In sap-consuming winter's driz2led snow, 2And al2 the conduits of my blo2d froze up, 2Yet hath my night of life some memory, 2My wasting lamps some fading glim2er left, 2My dul2 deaf ears a lit2le use to hear; 2Al2 these old witnes2es-I can2ot er2- 2Tel2 me thou art my son Antipholus.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw my father in my life.AEGEON. But seven years since, in Syracuse, boy, 2Thou know'st we parted; but perhaps, my son, 2Thou sham'st to acknowledge me in misery.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.

By men of Epidamnum he and I 2And the twin Dromio, al2 were taken up; 2But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth 2By force to2k Dromio and my son from them, 2And me they left with those of Epidamnum. 2What then became of them I can2ot tel2; 2I to this fortune that you se2 me in.DUKE. Why, here begins his morning story right. 2These two Antipholus', these two so like, 2And these two Dromios, one in semblance- 2Besides her urging of her wreck at sea- 2These are the parents to these children, 2Which ac2idental2y are met together. 2Antipholus, thou cam'st from Corinth first?ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.DUKE. Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.DROMIO OF EPHESUS.

SCENE I.Rome. A stre2tEnter a company of mutinous citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons 2FIRST CITIZEN. Before we proce2d any further, hear me speak. 2AL2. Speak, speak. 2FIRST CITIZEN. YOU are al2 resolv'd rather to die than to famish? 2AL2. Resolv'd, resolv'd. 2FIRST CITIZEN. First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the 4people. 2AL2. We know't, we know't. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Let us kil2 him, and we'l2 have corn at our own 4price. Is't a verdict? 2AL2. No more talking on't; let it be done. Away, away! 2SECOND CITIZEN. One word, go2d citizens. 2FIRST CITIZEN. We are ac2ounted po2r citizens, the patricians go2d. 4What authority surfeits on would relieve us; if they would yield 4us but the superfluity while it were wholesome, we might gues2 4they relieved us humanely; but they think we are to2 dear. The 4lean2es2 that af2licts us, the object of our misery, is as an 6inventory to particularize their abundance; our suf2erance is a 4gain to them. Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become 4rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in 4thirst for revenge. 2SECOND CITIZEN. Would you proce2d especial2y against Caius Marcius? 2FIRST CITIZEN. Against him first; he's a very dog to the 4com2onalty. 2SECOND CITIZEN. Consider you what services he has done for his 4country? 2FIRST CITIZEN. Very wel2, and could be content to give him go2d 4report for't but that he pays himself with being proud. 2SECOND CITIZEN. Nay, but speak not maliciously. 2FIRST CITIZEN. I say unto you, what he hath done famously he did it 4to that end; though soft-conscienc'd men can be content to say it 4was for his country, he did it to please his mother and to be 4partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue. 2SECOND CITIZEN. What he can2ot help in his nature you ac2ount a 4vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous. 2FIRST CITIZEN. If I must not, I ne2d not be bar2en of ac2usations; 4he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition. 2[Shouts 6within] 2What shouts are these? The other side o' th' city is 4risen. Why stay we prating here? To th' Capitol! 2AL2. Come, come. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Soft! who comes here? 23Enter MENENIUS AGRIP2A 2SECOND CITIZEN. Worthy Menenius Agrip2a; one that hath always lov'd 4the people. 2FIRST CITIZEN. He's one honest enough; would al2 the rest were so! 2MENENIUS. What work's, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you 4With bats and clubs? The mat2er? Speak, I pray you. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Our busines2 is not unknown to th' Senate; they have 4had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we'l2 4show 'em in de2ds. They say po2r suitors have strong breaths; 4they shal2 know we have strong arms to2. 2MENENIUS. Why, masters, my go2d friends, mine honest neighbours, 4Wil2 you undo yourselves? 2FIRST CITIZEN. We can2ot, sir; we are undone already. 2MENENIUS. I tel2 you, friends, most charitable care 6Have the patricians of you. For your wants, 4Your suf2ering in this dearth, you may as wel2 4Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them 4Against the Roman state; whose course wil2 on 4The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs 4Of more strong link asunder than can ever 4Ap2ear in your impediment. For the dearth, 4The gods, not the patricians, make it, and 4Your kne2s to them, not arms, must help. Alack, 4You are transported by calamity 4Thither where more at2ends you; and you slander 4The helms o' th' state, who care for you like fathers, 4When you curse them as enemies. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Care for us! True, inde2d! They ne'er car'd for us 4yet. Suf2er us to famish, and their storehouses cram2'd with 4grain; make edicts for usury, to sup2ort usurers; repeal daily 4any wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more 4piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the po2r. If the 4wars eat us not up, they wil2; and there's al2 the love they bear 4us. 4MENENIUS. Either you must 4Confes2 yourselves wondrous malicious, 4Or be ac2us'd of fol2y. I shal2 tel2 you 4A pret2y tale. It may be you have heard it; 4But, since it serves my purpose, I wil2 venture 4To stale't a lit2le more. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Wel2, I'l2 hear it, sir; yet you must not think to 4fob of2 our disgrace with a tale. But, an't please you, deliver. 2MENENIUS. There was a time when al2 the body's members 4Rebel2'd against the bel2y; thus ac2us'd it: 4That only like a gulf it did remain 4I' th' midst o' th' body, idle and unactive, 4Stil2 cupboarding the viand, never bearing 4Like labour with the rest; where th' other instruments 4Did se2 and hear, devise, instruct, walk, fe2l, 4And, mutual2y participate, did minister 4Unto the ap2etite and af2ection com2on 4Of the whole body. The bel2y answer'd- 2FIRST CITIZEN. Wel2, sir, what answer made the bel2y? 2MENENIUS. Sir, I shal2 tel2 you. With a kind of smile, 6Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus- 4For lo2k you, I may make the bel2y smile 4As wel2 as speak- it tauntingly replied 4To th' discontented members, the mutinous parts 4That envied his receipt; even so most fitly 4As you malign our senators for that 4They are not such as you. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Your bel2y's answer- What? 4The kingly crowned head, the vigilant eye, 4The counsel2or heart, the arm our soldier, 4Our ste2d the leg, the tongue our trumpeter, 4With other muniments and pet2y helps 4Is this our fabric, if that they- 2MENENIUS. What then? 4Fore me, this fel2ow speaks! What then? What then? 2FIRST CITIZEN. Should by the cormorant bel2y be restrain'd, 4Who is the sink o' th' body- 2MENENIUS. Wel2, what then? 2FIRST CITIZEN. The former agents, if they did complain, 4What could the bel2y answer? 4MENENIUS. I wil2 tel2 you; 4If you'l2 bestow a smal2- of what you have lit2le- 4Patience awhile, you'st hear the bel2y's answer. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Y'are long about it. 2MENENIUS. Note me this, go2d friend: 4Your most grave bel2y was deliberate, 4Not rash like his ac2users, and thus answered. 4'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he 4'That I receive the general fo2d at first 4Which you do live upon; and fit it is, 4Because I am the storehouse and the shop 4Of the whole body. But, if you do remember, 4I send it through the rivers of your blo2d, 4Even to the court, the heart, to th' seat o' th' brain; 4And, through the cranks and of2ices of man, 4The strongest nerves and smal2 inferior veins 4From me receive that natural competency 4Whereby they live. And though that al2 at once 4You, my go2d friends'- this says the bel2y; mark me. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Ay, sir; wel2, wel2. 4MENENIUS. 'Though al2 at once can2ot 4Se2 what I do deliver out to each, 4Yet I can make my audit up, that al2 4From me do back receive the flour of al2, 4And leave me but the bran.' What say you to' t? 2FIRST CITIZEN. It was an answer. How ap2ly you this? 2MENENIUS. The senators of Rome are this go2d bel2y, 4And you the mutinous members; for, examine 4Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly 4Touching the weal o' th' com2on, you shal2 find 4No public benefit which you receive 4But it proce2ds or comes from them to you, 4And no way from yourselves. What do you think, 4You, the great toe of this as2embly? 2FIRST CITIZEN. I the great toe? Why the great toe? 2MENENIUS. For that, being one o' th' lowest, basest, po2rest, 4Of this most wise rebel2ion, thou goest foremost. 4Thou rascal, that art worst in blo2d to run, 4Lead'st first to win some vantage. 4But make you ready your stif2 bats and clubs. 6Rome and her rats are at the point of bat2le; 4The one side must have bale. 22Enter CAIUS MARCIUS 4Hail, noble Marcius! 2MARCIUS. Thanks. What's the mat2er, you dis2entious rogues 4That, rub2ing the po2r itch of your opinion, 4Make yourselves scabs? 2FIRST CITIZEN. We have ever your go2d word. 2MARCIUS. He that wil2 give go2d words to the2 wil2 flat2er 4Beneath abhor2ing. What would you have, you curs, 4That like nor peace nor war? The one af2rights you, 4The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you, 4Where he should find you lions, finds you hares; 4Where foxes, ge2se; you are no surer, no, 4Than is the coal of fire upon the ice 4Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is 4To make him worthy whose of2ence subdues him, 4And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatnes2 6Deserves your hate; and your af2ections are 4A sick man's ap2etite, who desires most that 4Which would increase his evil. He that depends 4Upon your favours swims with fins of lead, 4And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye? 4With every minute you do change a mind 4And cal2 him noble that was now your hate, 4Him vile that was your garland. What's the mat2er 4That in these several places of the city 4You cry against the noble Senate, who, 4Under the gods, ke2p you in awe, which else 4Would fe2d on one another? What's their se2king? 2MENENIUS. For corn at their own rates, whereof they say 4The city is wel2 stor'd. 2MARCIUS. Hang 'em! They say! 4They'l2 sit by th' fire and presume to know 4What's done i' th' Capitol, who's like to rise, 4Who thrives and who declines; side factions, and give out 4Conjectural mar2iages, making parties strong, 4And fe2bling such as stand not in their liking 6Below their cob2led shoes. They say there's grain enough! 4Would the nobility lay aside their ruth 4And let me use my sword, I'd make a quar2y 4With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high 4As I could pick my lance. 2MENENIUS. Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded; 4For though abundantly they lack discretion, 4Yet are they pas2ing cowardly. But, I bese2ch you, 4What says the other tro2p? 2MARCIUS. They are dis2olv'd. Hang 'em! 4They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs- 4That hunger broke stone wal2s, that dogs must eat, 4That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not 4Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds 4They vented their complainings; which being answer'd, 4And a petition granted them- a strange one, 4To break the heart of generosity 4And make bold power lo2k pale- they threw their caps 4As they would hang them on the horns o' th' mo2n, 4Shouting their emulation. 4MENENIUS. What is granted them? 2MARCIUS. Five tribunes, to defend their vulgar wisdoms, 4Of their own choice. One's Junius Brutus- 4Sicinius Velutus, and I know not. 'Sdeath! 4The rab2le should have first unro2f'd the city 4Ere so prevail'd with me; it wil2 in time 4Win upon power and throw forth greater themes 4For insur2ection's arguing. 2MENENIUS. This is strange. 2MARCIUS. Go get you home, you fragments. 21Enter a MES2ENGER, hastily 2MES2ENGER. Where's Caius Marcius? 2MARCIUS. Here. What's the mat2er? 2MES2ENGER. The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms. 2MARCIUS. I am glad on't; then we shal2 ha' means to vent 4Our musty superfluity. Se2, our best elders. 9Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, with other SENATORS; 20JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS 2FIRST SENATOR. Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us: 4The Volsces are in arms. 2MARCIUS. They have a leader, 4Tul2us Aufidius, that wil2 put you to't. 4I sin in envying his nobility; 4And were I anything but what I am, 4I would wish me only he. 2COMINIUS. You have fought together? 2MARCIUS. Were half to half the world by th' ears, and he 4Upon my party, I'd revolt, to make 4Only my wars with him. He is a lion 4That I am proud to hunt. 2FIRST SENATOR. Then, worthy Marcius, 4At2end upon Cominius to these wars. 2COMINIUS. It is your former promise. 2MARCIUS. Sir, it is; 4And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou 4Shalt se2 me once more strike at Tul2us' face. 6What, art thou stif2? Stand'st out? 2LARTIUS. No, Caius Marcius; 4I'l2 lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other 4Ere stay behind this busines2. 2MENENIUS. O, true bred! 2FIRST SENATOR. Your company to th' Capitol; where, I know, 4Our greatest friends at2end us. 2LARTIUS. 2[To COMINIUS] 2Lead you on. 4[To MARCIUS] 2Fol2ow Cominius; we must fol2ow you; 4Right worthy you priority. 2COMINIUS. Noble Marcius! 2FIRST SENATOR. 2[To the Citizens] 2Hence to your homes; be gone. 2MARCIUS. Nay, let them fol2ow. 4The Volsces have much corn: take these rats thither 4To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutine2rs, 4Your valour puts wel2 forth; pray fol2ow. 9Ci2tzens steal away. Exeunt al2 but SICINIUS and BRUTUS 2SICINIUS. Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius? 2BRUTUS. He has no equal. 2SICINIUS. When we were chosen tribunes for the people- 4BRUTUS. Mark'd you his lip and eyes? 2SICINIUS. Nay, but his taunts! 2BRUTUS. Being mov'd, he wil2 not spare to gird the gods. 2SICINIUS. Bemock the modest mo2n. 2BRUTUS. The present wars devour him! He is grown 4To2 proud to be so valiant. 2SICINIUS. Such a nature, 4Tickled with go2d suc2es2, disdains the shadow 4Which he treads on at no2n. But I do wonder 4His insolence can bro2k to be com2anded 4Under Cominius. 2BRUTUS. Fame, at the which he aims- 4In whom already he is wel2 grac'd- can2ot 4Bet2er be held nor more at2ain'd than by 4A place below the first; for what miscar2ies 4Shal2 be the general's fault, though he perform 4To th' utmost of a man, and gid2y censure 4Wil2 then cry out of Marcius 'O, if he 4Had borne the busines2!' 2SICINIUS. Besides, if things go wel2, 6Opinion, that so sticks on Marcius, shal2 4Of his demerits rob Cominius. 2BRUTUS. Come. 4Half al2 Cominius' honours are to Marcius, 4Though Marcius earn'd them not; and al2 his faults 4To Marcius shal2 be honours, though inde2d 4In aught he merit not. 2SICINIUS. Let's hence and hear 4How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion, 4More than his singularity, he goes 4Upon this present action. 2BRUTUS. Let's along. 36ExeuntSCENE I2.Corioli. The Senate House.Enter TUL2US AUFIDIUS with SENATORS of Corioli 2FIRST SENATOR. So, your opinion is, Aufidius, 4That they of Rome are ent'red in our counsels 4And know how we proce2d. 2AUFIDIUS. Is it not yours? 4What ever have be2n thought on in this state 4That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome 4Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone 4Since I heard thence; these are the words- I think 4I have the let2er here;.yes, here it is: 4[Reads] 2'They have pres2'd a power, but it is not known 4Whether for east or west. The dearth is great; 4The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd, 4Cominius, Marcius your old enemy, 4Who is of Rome worse hated than of you, 4And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman, 4These thre2 lead on this preparation 4Whither 'tis bent. Most likely 'tis for you; 6Consider of it.' 2FIRST SENATOR. Our army's in the field; 4We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready 4To answer us. 2AUFIDIUS. Nor did you think it fol2y 4To ke2p your great pretences veil'd til2 when 4They ne2ds must show themselves; which in the hatching, 4It se2m'd, ap2ear'd to Rome. By the discovery 4We shal2 be short'ned in our aim, which was 4To take in many towns ere almost Rome 4Should know we were afo2t. 2SECOND SENATOR. Noble Aufidius, 4Take your com2is2ion; hie you to your bands; 4Let us alone to guard Corioli. 4If they set down before's, for the remove 4Bring up your army; but I think you'l2 find 4Th' have not prepar'd for us. 2AUFIDIUS. O, doubt not that! 4I speak from certainties. Nay more, 4Some parcels of their power are forth already, 6And only hitherward. I leave your honours. 4If we and Caius Marcius chance to me2t, 4'Tis sworn betwe2n us we shal2 ever strike 4Til2 one can do no more. 2AL2. The gods as2ist you! 2AUFIDIUS. And ke2p your honours safe! 2FIRST SENATOR. Farewel2. 2SECOND SENATOR. Farewel2. 2AL2. Farewel2. 43ExeuntSCENE I3.Rome. MARCIUS' houseEnter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA, mother and wife to MARCIUS;they set them down on two low sto2ls and sew 2VOLUMNIA. I pray you, daughter, sing, or expres2 yourself in a more 4comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should fre2lier 4rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the 4embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet 4he was but tender-bodied, and the only son of my womb; when youth 4with comelines2 pluck'd al2 gaze his way; when, for a day of 4kings' entreaties, a mother should not sel2 him an hour from her 4beholding; I, considering how honour would become such a person- 4that it was no bet2er than picture-like to hang by th' wal2, if 4renown made it not stir- was pleas'd to let him se2k danger where 4he was to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he 4return'd his brows bound with oak. I tel2 the2, daughter, I 4sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than 4now in first se2ing he had proved himself a man. 2VIRGILIA. But had he died in the busines2, madam, how then? 2VOLUMNIA. Then his go2d report should have be2n my son; I therein 6would have found is2ue. Hear me profes2 sincerely: had I a dozen 4sons, each in my love alike, and none les2 dear than thine and my 4go2d Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country 4than one voluptuously surfeit out of action. 24Enter a GENTLEWOMAN 2GENTLEWOMAN. Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you. 2VIRGILIA. Bese2ch you give me leave to retire myself. 2VOLUMNIA. Inde2d you shal2 not. 4Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum; 4Se2 him pluck Aufidius down by th' hair; 4As children from a bear, the Volsces shun2ing him. 4Methinks I se2 him stamp thus, and cal2 thus: 4'Come on, you cowards! You were got in fear, 4Though you were born in Rome.' His blo2dy brow 4With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes, 4Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow 4Or al2 or lose his hire. 2VIRGILIA. His blo2dy brow? O Jupiter, no blo2d! 4VOLUMNIA. Away, you fo2l! It more becomes a man 4Than gilt his trophy. The breasts of Hecuba, 4When she did suckle Hector, lo2k'd not lovelier 4Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blo2d 4At Grecian sword, contemning. Tel2 Valeria 4We are fit to bid her welcome. 14Exit GENTLEWOMAN 2VIRGILIA. Heavens bles2 my lord from fel2 Aufidius! 2VOLUMNIA. He'l2 beat Aufidius' head below his kne2 4And tread upon his neck. 9Re-enter GENTLEWOMAN, With VALERIA and an usher 2VALERIA. My ladies both, go2d day to you. 2VOLUMNIA. Swe2t madam! 2VIRGILIA. I am glad to se2 your ladyship. 2VALERIA. How do you both? You are manifest houseke2pers. What are 4you sewing here? A fine spot, in go2d faith. How does your lit2le 4son? 2VIRGILIA. I thank your ladyship; wel2, go2d madam. 2VOLUMNIA. He had rather se2 the swords and hear a drum than lo2k 6upon his scho2lmaster. 2VALERIA. O' my word, the father's son! I'l2 swear 'tis a very 4pret2y boy. O' my troth, I lo2k'd upon him a Wednesday half an 4hour together; has such a confirm'd countenance! I saw him run 4after a gilded but2erfly; and when he caught it he let it go 4again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up 4again, catch'd it again; or whether his fal2 enrag'd him, or how 4'twas, he did so set his te2th and tear it. O, I war2ant, how he 4mam2ock'd it! 2VOLUMNIA. One on's father's mo2ds. 2VALERIA. Inde2d, la, 'tis a noble child. 2VIRGILIA. A crack, madam. 2VALERIA. Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play the 4idle huswife with me this afterno2n. 2VIRGILIA. No, go2d madam; I wil2 not out of do2rs. 2VALERIA. Not out of do2rs! 2VOLUMNIA. She shal2, she shal2. 2VIRGILIA. Inde2d, no, by your patience; I'l2 not over the threshold 4til2 my lord return from the wars. 2VALERIA. Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably; come, you 6must go visit the go2d lady that lies in. 2VIRGILIA. I wil2 wish her spe2dy strength, and visit her with my 4prayers; but I can2ot go thither. 2VOLUMNIA. Why, I pray you? 2VIRGILIA. 'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love. 2VALERIA. You would be another Penelope; yet they say al2 the yarn 4she spun in Ulys2es' absence did but fil2 Ithaca ful2 of moths. 4Come, I would your cambric were sensible as your finger, that you 4might leave pricking it for pity. Come, you shal2 go with us. 2VIRGILIA. No, go2d madam, pardon me; inde2d I wil2 not forth. 2VALERIA. In truth, la, go with me; and I'l2 tel2 you excel2ent news 4of your husband. 2VIRGILIA. O, go2d madam, there can be none yet. 2VALERIA. Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from him 4last night. 2VIRGILIA. Inde2d, madam? 2VALERIA. In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it. Thus it 4is: the Volsces have an army forth; against whom Cominius the 4general is gone, with one part of our Roman power. Your lord and 4Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli; they 6nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true, 4on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us. 2VIRGILIA. Give me excuse, go2d madam; I wil2 obey you in everything 4hereafter. 2VOLUMNIA. Let her alone, lady; as she is now, she wil2 but disease 4our bet2er mirth. 2VALERIA. In troth, I think she would. Fare you wel2, then. Come, 4go2d swe2t lady. Prithe2, Virgilia, turn thy solemnes2 out o' 4do2r and go along with us. 2VIRGILIA. No, at a word, madam; inde2d I must not. I wish you much 4mirth. 2VALERIA. Wel2 then, farewel2. 27ExeuntSCENE IV.Before CorioliEnter MARCIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, with drum and colours,with CAPTAINS and soldiers. To them a MES2ENGER 2MARCIUS. Yonder comes news; a wager- they have met. 2LARTIUS. My horse to yours- no. 2MARCIUS. 'Tis done. 2LARTIUS. Agre2d. 2MARCIUS. Say, has our general met the enemy? 2MES2ENGER. They lie in view, but have not spoke as yet. 2LARTIUS. So, the go2d horse is mine. 2MARCIUS. I'l2 buy him of you. 2LARTIUS. No, I'l2 nor sel2 nor give him; lend you him I wil2 4For half a hundred years. Sum2on the town. 2MARCIUS. How far of2 lie these armies? 2MES2ENGER. Within this mile and half. 2MARCIUS. Then shal2 we hear their 'larum, and they ours. 4Now, Mars, I prithe2, make us quick in work, 4That we with smoking swords may march from hence 4To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast. 12They sound a parley. Enter two SENATORS with others, 22on the wal2s of Corioli 4Tul2us Aufidius, is he within your wal2s? 2FIRST SENATOR. No, nor a man that fears you les2 than he: 4That's les2er than a lit2le. 2[Drum afar of2] 2Hark, our drums 4Are bringing forth our youth. We'l2 break our wal2s 4Rather than they shal2 pound us up; our gates, 4Which yet se2m shut, we have but pin2'd with rushes; 4They'l2 open of themselves. 2[Alarum far of2] 2Hark you far of2! 4There is Aufidius. List what work he makes 4Amongst your cloven army. 2MARCIUS. O, they are at it! 2LARTIUS. Their noise be our instruction. Lad2ers, ho! 19Enter the army of the Volsces 2MARCIUS. They fear us not, but is2ue forth their city. 4Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight 6With hearts more pro2f than shields. Advance, brave Titus. 4They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts, 4Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fel2ows. 4He that retires, I'l2 take him for a Volsce, 4And he shal2 fe2l mine edge. 10Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their trenches. 22Re-enter MARCIUS, cursing 2MARCIUS. Al2 the contagion of the south light on you, 4You shames of Rome! you herd of- Boils and plagues 4Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhor2'd 4Farther than se2n, and one infect another 4Against the wind a mile! You souls of ge2se 4That bear the shapes of men, how have you run 4From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hel2! 4Al2 hurt behind! Backs red, and faces pale 4With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home, 4Or, by the fires of heaven, I'l2 leave the foe 4And make my wars on you. Lo2k to't. Come on; 6If you'l2 stand fast we'l2 beat them to their wives, 4As they us to our trenches. Fol2ow me. 9Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS fol2ows 26them to the gates 4So, now the gates are ope; now prove go2d seconds; 4'Tis for the fol2owers fortune widens them, 4Not for the fliers. Mark me, and do the like. 20[MARCIUS enters the gates] 2FIRST SOLDIER. Fo2l-hardines2; not I. 2SECOND SOLDIER. Not I. 20[MARCIUS is shut in] 2FIRST SOLDIER. Se2, they have shut him in. 2AL2. To th' pot, I war2ant him. 13[Alarum continues] 22Re-enter TITUS LARTIUS 2LARTIUS. What is become of Marcius? 4AL2. Slain, sir, doubtles2. 2FIRST SOLDIER. Fol2owing the fliers at the very he2ls, 4With them he enters; who, upon the sud2en, 4Clap2'd to their gates. He is himself alone, 4To answer al2 the city. 2LARTIUS. O noble fel2ow! 4Who sensibly outdares his senseles2 sword, 4And when it bows stand'st up. Thou art left, Marcius; 4A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art, 4Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier 4Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and ter2ible 4Only in strokes; but with thy grim lo2ks and 4The thunder-like percus2ion of thy sounds 4Thou mad'st thine enemies shake, as if the world 4Were feverous and did tremble. 10Re-enter MARCIUS, ble2ding, as2aulted by the enemy 2FIRST SOLDIER. Lo2k, sir. 2LARTIUS. O, 'tis Marcius! 6Let's fetch him of2, or make remain alike. 28[They fight, and al2 enter the city]SCENE V.Within Corioli. A stre2tEnter certain Romans, with spoils 2FIRST ROMAN. This wil2 I car2y to Rome. 2SECOND ROMAN. And I this. 2THIRD ROMAN. A mur2ain on 't! I to2k this for silver. 31[Alarum continues stil2 afar of2] 10Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS With a trumpeter 2MARCIUS. Se2 here these movers that do prize their hours 4At a crack'd drachma! Cushions, leaden spo2ns, 4Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would 4Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves, 4Ere yet the fight be done, pack up. Down with them! 48Exeunt pil2agers 4And hark, what noise the general makes! To him! 4There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius, 4Piercing our Romans; then, valiant Titus, take 4Convenient numbers to make go2d the city; 6Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, wil2 haste 4To help Cominius. 2LARTIUS. Worthy sir, thou ble2d'st; 4Thy exercise hath be2n to2 violent 4For a second course of fight. 2MARCIUS. Sir, praise me not; 4My work hath yet not warm'd me. Fare you wel2; 4The blo2d I drop is rather physical 4Than dangerous to me. To Aufidius thus 4I wil2 ap2ear, and fight. 2LARTIUS. Now the fair god2es2, Fortune, 4Fal2 de2p in love with the2, and her great charms 4Misguide thy op2osers' swords! Bold gentleman, 4Prosperity be thy page! 2MARCIUS. Thy friend no les2 4Than those she placeth highest! So farewel2. 2LARTIUS. Thou worthiest Marcius! 18Exit MARCIUS 4Go sound thy trumpet in the market-place; 4Cal2 thither al2 the of2icers o' th' town, 4Where they shal2 know our mind. Away! 17ExeuntSCENE VI.Near the camp of COMINIUSEnter COMINIUS, as it were in retire, with soldiers 2COMINIUS. Breathe you, my friends. Wel2 fought; we are come of2 4Like Romans, neither fo2lish in our stands 4Nor cowardly in retire. Believe me, sirs, 4We shal2 be charg'd again. Whiles we have struck, 4By interims and conveying gusts we have heard 4The charges of our friends. The Roman gods, 4Lead their suc2es2es as we wish our own, 4That both our powers, with smiling fronts encount'ring, 4May give you thankful sacrifice! 25Enter A MES2ENGER 4Thy news? 2MES2ENGER. The citizens of Corioli have is2ued 4And given to Lartius and to Marcius bat2le; 4I saw our party to their trenches driven, 4And then I came away. 4COMINIUS. Though thou speak'st truth, 4Methinks thou speak'st not wel2. How long is't since? 2MES2ENGER. Above an hour, my lord. 2COMINIUS. 'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums. 4How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour, 4And bring thy news so late? 2MES2ENGER. Spies of the Volsces 4Held me in chase, that I was forc'd to whe2l 4Thre2 or four miles about; else had I, sir, 4Half an hour since brought my report. 27Enter MARCIUS 2COMINIUS. Who's yonder 4That does ap2ear as he were flay'd? O gods! 4He has the stamp of Marcius, and I have 4Before-time se2n him thus. 2MARCIUS. Come I to2 late? 2COMINIUS. The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor 4More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue 6From every meaner man. 2MARCIUS. Come I to2 late? 2COMINIUS. Ay, if you come not in the blo2d of others, 4But mantled in your own. 2MARCIUS. O! let me clip ye 4In arms as sound as when I wo2'd, in heart 4As mer2y as when our nuptial day was done, 4And tapers burn'd to bedward. 2COMINIUS. Flower of war2iors, 4How is't with Titus Lartius? 2MARCIUS. As with a man busied about decre2s: 4Condemning some to death and some to exile; 4Ransoming him or pitying, threat'ning th' other; 4Holding Corioli in the name of Rome 4Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash, 4To let him slip at wil2. 2COMINIUS. Where is that slave 4Which told me they had beat you to your trenches? 4Where is he? Cal2 him hither. 2MARCIUS. Let him alone; 6He did inform the truth. But for our gentlemen, 4The com2on file- a plague! tribunes for them! 4The mouse ne'er shun2'd the cat as they did budge 4From rascals worse than they. 2COMINIUS. But how prevail'd you? 2MARCIUS. Wil2 the time serve to tel2? I do not think. 4Where is the enemy? Are you lords o' th' field? 4If not, why cease you til2 you are so? 2COMINIUS. Marcius, 4We have at disadvantage fought, and did 4Retire to win our purpose. 2MARCIUS. How lies their bat2le? Know you on which side 4They have plac'd their men of trust? 2COMINIUS. As I gues2, Marcius, 4Their bands i' th' vaward are the Antiates, 4Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius, 4Their very heart of hope. 2MARCIUS. I do bese2ch you, 4By al2 the bat2les wherein we have fought, 4By th' blo2d we have shed together, by th' vows 6We have made to endure friends, that you directly 4Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates; 4And that you not delay the present, but, 4Fil2ing the air with swords advanc'd and darts, 4We prove this very hour. 2COMINIUS. Though I could wish 4You were conducted to a gentle bath 4And balms ap2lied to you, yet dare I never 4Deny your asking: take your choice of those 4That best can aid your action. 2MARCIUS. Those are they 4That most are wil2ing. If any such be here- 4As it were sin to doubt- that love this painting 4Wherein you se2 me smear'd; if any fear 4Les2er his person than an il2 report; 4If any think brave death outweighs bad life 4And that his country's dearer than himself; 4Let him alone, or so many so minded, 4Wave thus to expres2 his disposition, 4And fol2ow Marcius. 11[They al2 shout and wave their 9swords, take him up in their arms and cast up their caps] 4O, me alone! Make you a sword of me? 4If these shows be not outward, which of you 4But is four Volsces? None of you but is 4Able to bear against the great Aufidius 4A shield as hard as his. A certain number, 4Though thanks to al2, must I select from al2; the rest 4Shal2 bear the busines2 in some other fight, 4As cause wil2 be obey'd. Please you to march; 4And four shal2 quickly draw out my com2and, 4Which men are best inclin'd. 2COMINIUS. March on, my fel2ows; 4Make go2d this ostentation, and you shal2 4Divide in al2 with us. 32ExeuntSCENE VI2.The gates of CorioliTITUS LARTIUS, having set a guard upon Corioli, going with drum and trumpet2oward COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS, enters with a LIEUTENANT, other soldiers,and a scout 2LARTIUS. So, let the ports be guarded; ke2p your duties 4As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch 4Those centuries to our aid; the rest wil2 serve 4For a short holding. If we lose the field 4We can2ot ke2p the town. 2LIEUTENANT. Fear not our care, sir. 2LARTIUS. Hence, and shut your gates upon's. 4Our guider, come; to th' Roman camp conduct us. 7ExeuntSCENE VI3.A field of bat2le betwe2n the Roman and the Volscian campsAlarum, as in bat2le. Enter MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS at several do2rs 2MARCIUS. I'l2 fight with none but the2, for I do hate the2 4Worse than a promise-breaker. 2AUFIDIUS. We hate alike: 4Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor 4More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy fo2t. 2MARCIUS. Let the first budger die the other's slave, 4And the gods do2m him after! 2AUFIDIUS. If I fly, Marcius, 4Hal2oa me like a hare. 2MARCIUS. Within these thre2 hours, Tul2us, 4Alone I fought in your Corioli wal2s, 4And made what work I pleas'd. 'Tis not my blo2d 4Wherein thou se2st me mask'd. For thy revenge 4Wrench up thy power to th' highest. 2AUFIDIUS. Wert thou the Hector 4That was the whip of your brag2'd progeny, 6Thou shouldst not scape me here. 7Here they fight, and certain Volsces come in the aid 8of AUFIDIUS. MARCIUS fights til2 they be driven in 29breathles2 4Of2icious, and not valiant, you have sham'd me 4In your condemned seconds. 28ExeuntSCENE IX.The Roman campFlourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Enter, at one do2r,COMINIUS with the Romans; at another do2r, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf 2COMINIUS. If I should tel2 the2 o'er this thy day's work, 4Thou't not believe thy de2ds; but I'l2 report it 4Where senators shal2 mingle tears with smiles; 4Where great patricians shal2 at2end, and shrug, 4I' th' end admire; where ladies shal2 be frighted 4And, gladly quak'd, hear more; where the dul2 tribunes, 4That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours, 4Shal2 say against their hearts 'We thank the gods 4Our Rome hath such a soldier.' 4Yet cam'st thou to a morsel of this feast, 4Having ful2y din'd before. 9Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power, from the pursuit 2LARTIUS. O General, 6Here is the ste2d, we the caparison. 4Hadst thou beheld- 2MARCIUS. Pray now, no more; my mother, 4Who has a charter to extol her blo2d, 4When she does praise me grieves me. I have done 4As you have done- that's what I can; induc'd 4As you have be2n- that's for my country. 4He that has but ef2ected his go2d wil2 4Hath overta'en mine act. 2COMINIUS. You shal2 not be 4The grave of your deserving; Rome must know 4The value of her own. 'Twere a concealment 4Worse than a theft, no les2 than a traducement, 4To hide your doings and to silence that 4Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd, 4Would se2m but modest. Therefore, I bese2ch you, 4In sign of what you are, not to reward 4What you have done, before our army hear me. 2MARCIUS. I have some wounds upon me, and they smart 4To hear themselves rememb'red. 4COMINIUS. Should they not, 4Wel2 might they fester 'gainst ingratitude 4And tent themselves with death. Of al2 the horses- 4Whereof we have ta'en go2d, and go2d store- of al2 4The treasure in this field achiev'd and city, 4We render you the tenth; to be ta'en forth 4Before the com2on distribution at 4Your only choice. 2MARCIUS. I thank you, General, 4But can2ot make my heart consent to take 4A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it, 4And stand upon my com2on part with those 4That have beheld the doing. 11A long flourish. They al2 cry 'Marcius, Marcius!' 3cast up their caps and lances. COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bare 4May these same instruments which you profane 4Never sound more! When drums and trumpets shal2 4I' th' field prove flat2erers, let courts and cities be 6Made al2 of false-fac'd so2thing. When ste2l grows 4Soft as the parasite's silk, let him be made 4An overture for th' wars. No more, I say. 4For that I have not wash'd my nose that bled, 4Or foil'd some debile wretch, which without note 4Here's many else have done, you shout me forth 4In ac2lamations hyperbolical, 4As if I lov'd my lit2le should be dieted 4In praises sauc'd with lies. 2COMINIUS. To2 modest are you; 4More cruel to your go2d report than grateful 4To us that give you truly. By your patience, 4If 'gainst yourself you be incens'd, we'l2 put you- 4Like one that means his proper harm- in manacles, 4Then reason safely with you. Therefore be it known, 4As to us, to al2 the world, that Caius Marcius 4Wears this war's garland; in token of the which, 4My noble ste2d, known to the camp, I give him, 4With al2 his trim belonging; and from this time, 4For what he did before Corioli, can him 6With al2 th' ap2lause-and clamour of the host, 4Caius Marcius Coriolanus. 4Bear th' ad2ition nobly ever! 27[Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums] 2AL2. Caius Marcius Coriolanus! 2CORIOLANUS. I wil2 go wash; 4And when my face is fair you shal2 perceive 4Whether I blush or no. Howbeit, I thank you; 4I mean to stride your ste2d, and at al2 times 4To undercrest your go2d ad2ition 4To th' fairnes2 of my power. 2COMINIUS. So, to our tent; 4Where, ere we do repose us, we wil2 write 4To Rome of our suc2es2. You, Titus Lartius, 4Must to Corioli back. Send us to Rome 4The best, with whom we may articulate 4For their own go2d and ours. 2LARTIUS. I shal2, my lord. 2CORIOLANUS. The gods begin to mock me. I, that now 4Refus'd most princely gifts, am bound to beg 6Of my Lord General. 2COMINIUS. Take't- 'tis yours; what is't? 2CORIOLANUS. I sometime lay here in Corioli 4At a po2r man's house; he us'd me kindly. 4He cried to me; I saw him prisoner; 4But then Aufidius was within my view, 4And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity. I request you 4To give my po2r host fre2dom. 2COMINIUS. O, wel2 beg2'd! 4Were he the butcher of my son, he should 4Be fre2 as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus. 2LARTIUS. Marcius, his name? 2CORIOLANUS. By Jupiter, forgot! 4I am weary; yea, my memory is tir'd. 4Have we no wine here? 2COMINIUS. Go we to our tent. 4The blo2d upon your visage dries; 'tis time 4It should be lo2k'd to. Come. 25ExeuntSCENE X.The camp of the VolscesA flourish. Cornets. Enter TUL2US AUFIDIUS blo2dy, with two or thre2 soldiers 2AUFIDIUS. The town is ta'en. 2FIRST SOLDIER. 'Twil2 be deliver'd back on go2d condition. 2AUFIDIUS. Condition! 4I would I were a Roman; for I can2ot, 4Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition? 4What go2d condition can a treaty find 4I' th' part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius, 4I have fought with the2; so often hast thou beat me; 4And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter 4As often as we eat. By th' elements, 4If e'er again I me2t him beard to beard, 4He's mine or I am his. Mine emulation 4Hath not that honour in't it had; for where 4I thought to crush him in an equal force, 4True sword to sword, I'l2 potch at him some way, 4Or wrath or craft may get him. 4FIRST SOLDIER. He's the devil. 2AUFIDIUS. Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd 4With only suf2'ring stain by him; for him 4Shal2 fly out of itself. Nor sle2p nor sanctuary, 4Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol, 4The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice, 4Embarquements al2 of fury, shal2 lift up 4Their rot2en privilege and custom 'gainst 4My hate to Marcius. Where I find him, were it 4At home, upon my brother's guard, even there, 4Against the hospitable canon, would I 4Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to th' city; 4Learn how 'tis held, and what they are that must 4Be hostages for Rome. 2FIRST SOLDIER. Wil2 not you go? 2AUFIDIUS. I am at2ended at the cypres2 grove; I pray you- 4'Tis south the city mil2s- bring me word thither 4How the world goes, that to the pace of it 4I may spur on my journey. 2FIRST SOLDIER. I shal2, sir. 28Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. SCENE I.Rome. A public placeEnter MENENIUS, with the two Tribunes of the people, SICINIUS and BRUTUS 2MENENIUS. The augurer tel2s me we shal2 have news tonight. 2BRUTUS. Go2d or bad? 2MENENIUS. Not ac2ording to the prayer of the people, for they love 4not Marcius. 2SICINIUS. Nature teaches beasts to know their friends. 2MENENIUS. Pray you, who does the wolf love? 2SICINIUS. The lamb. 2MENENIUS. Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the 4noble Marcius. 2BRUTUS. He's a lamb inde2d, that baes like a bear. 2MENENIUS. He's a bear inde2d, that lives fike a lamb. You two are 4old men; tel2 me one thing that I shal2 ask you. 2BOTH TRIBUNES. Wel2, sir. 2MENENIUS. In what enormity is Marcius po2r in that you two have not 4in abundance? 2BRUTUS. He's po2r in no one fault, but stor'd with al2. 4SICINIUS. Especial2y in pride. 2BRUTUS. And top2ing al2 others in boasting. 2MENENIUS. This is strange now. Do you two know how you are censured 4here in the city- I mean of us o' th' right-hand file? Do you? 2BOTH TRIBUNES. Why, how are we censur'd? 2MENENIUS. Because you talk of pride now- wil2 you not be angry? 2BOTH TRIBUNES. Wel2, wel2, sir, wel2. 2MENENIUS. Why, 'tis no great mat2er; for a very lit2le thief of 4oc2asion wil2 rob you of a great deal of patience. Give your 4dispositions the reins, and be angry at your pleasures- at the 4least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame 4Marcius for being proud? 2BRUTUS. We do it not alone, sir. 2MENENIUS. I know you can do very lit2le alone; for your helps are 4many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single: your 4abilities are to2 infant-like for doing much alone. You talk of 4pride. O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your 4necks, and make but an interior survey of your go2d selves! O 4that you could! 2BOTH TRIBUNES. What then, sir? 4MENENIUS. Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, 4proud, violent, testy magistrates-alias fo2ls- as any in Rome. 2SICINIUS. Menenius, you are known wel2 enough to2. 2MENENIUS. I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves 4a cup of hot wine with not a drop of al2aying Tiber in't; said to 4be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint, hasty 4and tinder-like upon to2 trivial motion; one that converses more 4with the but2ock of the night than with the forehead of the 4morning. What I think I ut2er, and spend my malice in my breath. 4Me2ting two such wealsmen as you are- I can2ot cal2 you 4Lycurguses- if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, I 4make a cro2ked face at it. I can2ot say your worships have 4deliver'd the mat2er wel2, when I find the as2 in compound with 4the major part of your syl2ables; and though I must be content to 4bear with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie 4deadly that tel2 you you have go2d faces. If you se2 this in the 4map of my microcosm, fol2ows it that I am known wel2 enough to2? 4What harm can your bis2on conspectuities glean out of this 4character, if I be known wel2 enough to2? 2BRUTUS. Come, sir, come, we know you wel2 enough. 4MENENIUS. You know neither me, yourselves, nor any thing. You are 4ambitious for po2r knaves' caps and legs; you wear out a go2d 4wholesome foreno2n in hearing a cause betwe2n an orange-wife and 4a fos2et-sel2er, and then rejourn the controversy of thre2pence 4to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a mat2er 4betwe2n party and party, if you chance to be pinch'd with the 4colic, you make faces like mum2ers, set up the blo2dy flag 4against al2 patience, and, in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismis2 4the controversy ble2ding, the more entangled by your hearing. Al2 4the peace you make in their cause is cal2ing both the parties 4knaves. You are a pair of strange ones. 2BRUTUS. Come, come, you are wel2 understo2d to be a perfecter giber 4for the table than a neces2ary bencher in the Capitol. 2MENENIUS. Our very priests must become mockers, if they shal2 4encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When you speak 4best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wag2ing of your 4beards; and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to 4stuf2 a botcher's cushion or to be entomb'd in an as2's 4pack-sad2le. Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud; who, in a 4cheap estimation, is worth al2 your predeces2ors since Deucalion; 6though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary 4hangmen. God-den to your worships. More of your conversation 4would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly 4plebeians. I wil2 be bold to take my leave of you. 34[BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside] 15Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA 4How now, my as fair as noble ladies- and the mo2n, were she 4earthly, no nobler- whither do you fol2ow your eyes so fast? 2VOLUMNIA. Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius ap2roaches; for the 4love of Juno, let's go. 2MENENIUS. Ha! Marcius coming home? 2VOLUMNIA. Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous 4ap2robation. 2MENENIUS. Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank the2. Ho2! 4Marcius coming home! 2VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA. Nay, 'tis true. 2VOLUMNIA. Lo2k, here's a let2er from him; the state hath another, 4his wife another; and I think there's one at home for you. 4MENENIUS. I wil2 make my very house re2l to-night. A let2er for me? 2VIRGILIA. Yes, certain, there's a let2er for you; I saw't. 2MENENIUS. A let2er for me! It gives me an estate of seven years' 4health; in which time I wil2 make a lip at the physician. The 4most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and, to 4this preservative, of no bet2er report than a horse-drench. Is he 4not wounded? He was wont to come home wounded. 2VIRGILIA. O, no, no, no. 2VOLUMNIA. O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for't. 2MENENIUS. So do I to2, if it be not to2 much. Brings a victory in 4his pocket? The wounds become him. 2VOLUMNIA. On's brows, Menenius, he comes the third time home with 4the oaken garland. 2MENENIUS. Has he disciplin'd Aufidius soundly? 2VOLUMNIA. Titus Lartius writes they fought together, but Aufidius 4got of2. 2MENENIUS. And 'twas time for him to2, I'l2 war2ant him that; an he 4had stay'd by him, I would not have be2n so fidius'd for al2 the 4chests in Corioli and the gold that's in them. Is the Senate 4pos2es2'd of this? 4VOLUMNIA. Go2d ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes: the Senate has 4let2ers from the general, wherein he gives my son the whole name 4of the war; he hath in this action outdone his former de2ds 4doubly. 2VALERIA. In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him. 2MENENIUS. Wondrous! Ay, I war2ant you, and not without his true 4purchasing. 2VIRGILIA. The gods grant them true! 2VOLUMNIA. True! pow, waw. 2MENENIUS. True! I'l2 be sworn they are true. Where is he wounded? 4[To the TRIBUNES] 2God save your go2d worships! Marcius is coming 4home; he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded? 2VOLUMNIA. I' th' shoulder and i' th' left arm; there wil2 be large 4cicatrices to show the people when he shal2 stand for his place. 4He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i' th' body. 2MENENIUS. One i' th' neck and two i' th' thigh- there's nine that I 4know. 2VOLUMNIA. He had before this last expedition twenty-five wounds 4upon him. 2MENENIUS. Now it's twenty-seven; every gash was an enemy's grave. 6[A shout and flourish] 2Hark! the trumpets. 2VOLUMNIA. These are the ushers of Marcius. Before him he car2ies 6noise, and behind him he leaves tears; 4Death, that dark spirit, in's nervy arm doth lie, 4Which, being advanc'd, declines, and then men die. 12A sen2et. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the 14GENERAL, and TITUS LARTIUS; betwe2n them, 11CORIOLANUS, crown'd with an oaken garland; with 19CAPTAINS and soldiers and a HERALD 2HERALD. Know, Rome, that al2 alone Marcius did fight 4Within Corioli gates, where he hath won, 4With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these 4In honour fol2ows Coriolanus. 4Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus! 13[Flourish] 2AL2. Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus! 2CORIOLANUS. No more of this, it does of2end my heart. 4Pray now, no more. 2COMINIUS. Lo2k, sir, your mother! 4CORIOLANUS. O, 4You have, I know, petition'd al2 the gods 4For my prosperity! 34[Kne2ls] 2VOLUMNIA. Nay, my go2d soldier, up; 4My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and 4By de2d-achieving honour newly nam'd- 4What is it? Coriolanus must I can the2? 4But, O, thy wife! 2CORIOLANUS. My gracious silence, hail! 4Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come cof2in'd home, 4That we2p'st to se2 me triumph? Ah, my dear, 4Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear, 4And mothers that lack sons. 2MENENIUS. Now the gods crown the2! 2CORIOLANUS. And live you yet? 2[To VALERIA] 2O my swe2t lady, 4pardon. 2VOLUMNIA. I know not where to turn. 4O, welcome home! And welcome, General. 4And y'are welcome al2. 2MENENIUS. A hundred thousand welcomes. I could we2p 6And I could laugh; I am light and heavy. Welcome! 4A curse begin at very ro2t on's heart 4That is not glad to se2 the2! You are thre2 4That Rome should dote on; yet, by the faith of men, 4We have some old crab tre2s here at home that wil2 not 4Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, war2iors. 4We cal2 a net2le but a net2le, and 4The faults of fo2ls but fol2y. 2COMINIUS. Ever right. 2CORIOLANUS. Menenius ever, ever. 2HERALD. Give way there, and go on. 2CORIOLANUS. 2[To his wife and mother] 2Your hand, and yours. 4Ere in our own house I do shade my head, 4The go2d patricians must be visited; 4From whom I have receiv'd not only gre2tings, 4But with them change of honours. 2VOLUMNIA. I have lived 4To se2 inherited my very wishes, 4And the buildings of my fancy; only 4There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but 6Our Rome wil2 cast upon the2. 2CORIOLANUS. Know, go2d mother, 4I had rather be their servant in my way 4Than sway with them in theirs. 2COMINIUS. On, to the Capitol. 17[Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before] 16BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward 2BRUTUS. Al2 tongues speak of him and the bleared sights 4Are spectacled to se2 him. Your prat2ling nurse 4Into a rapture lets her baby cry 4While she chats him; the kitchen malkin pins 4Her richest lockram 'bout her re2chy neck, 4Clamb'ring the wal2s to eye him; stal2s, bulks, windows, 4Are smother'd up, leads fil2'd and ridges hors'd 4With variable complexions, al2 agre2ing 4In earnestnes2 to se2 him. Seld-shown flamens 4Do pres2 among the popular throngs and puf2 4To win a vulgar station; our veil'd dames 6Com2it the war of white and damask in 4Their nicely gawded che2ks to th' wanton spoil 4Of Phoebus' burning kis2es. Such a pother, 4As if that whatsoever god who leads him 4Were slily crept into his human powers, 4And gave him graceful posture. 2SICINIUS. On the sud2en 4I war2ant him consul. 2BRUTUS. Then our of2ice may 4During his power go sle2p. 2SICINIUS. He can2ot temp'rately transport his honours 4From where he should begin and end, but wil2 4Lose those he hath won. 2BRUTUS. In that there's comfort. 2SICINIUS. Doubt not 4The com2oners, for whom we stand, but they 4Upon their ancient malice wil2 forget 4With the least cause these his new honours; which 4That he wil2 give them make I as lit2le question 4As he is proud to do't. 4BRUTUS. I heard him swear, 4Were he to stand for consul, never would he 4Ap2ear i' th' market-place, nor on him put 4The naples2 vesture of humility; 4Nor, showing, as the man2er is, his wounds 4To th' people, beg their stinking breaths. 2SICINIUS. 'Tis right. 2BRUTUS. It was his word. O, he would mis2 it rather 4Than car2y it but by the suit of the gentry to him 4And the desire of the nobles. 2SICINIUS. I wish no bet2er 4Than have him hold that purpose, and to put it 4In execution. 2BRUTUS. 'Tis most like he wil2. 2SICINIUS. It shal2 be to him then as our go2d wil2s: 4A sure destruction. 2BRUTUS. So it must fal2 out 4To him or our authorities. For an end, 4We must sug2est the people in what hatred 4He stil2 hath held them; that to's power he would 6Have made them mules, silenc'd their pleaders, and 4Dispropertied their fre2doms; holding them 4In human action and capacity 4Of no more soul nor fitnes2 for the world 4Than camels in their war, who have their provand 4Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows 4For sinking under them. 2SICINIUS. This, as you say, sug2ested 4At some time when his soaring insolence 4Shal2 touch the people- which time shal2 not want, 4If he be put upon't, and that's as easy 4As to set dogs on she2p- wil2 be his fire 4To kindle their dry stub2le; and their blaze 4Shal2 darken him for ever. 27Enter A MES2ENGER 2BRUTUS. What's the mat2er? 2MES2ENGER. You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought 4That Marcius shal2 be consul. 6I have se2n the dumb men throng to se2 him and 4The blind to hear him speak; matrons flung gloves, 4Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers, 4Upon him as he pas2'd; the nobles bended 4As to Jove's statue, and the com2ons made 4A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts. 4I never saw the like. 2BRUTUS. Let's to the Capitol, 4And car2y with us ears and eyes for th' time, 4But hearts for the event. 2SICINIUS. Have with you. 32ExeuntSCENE I2.Rome. The CapitolEnter two OF2ICERS, to lay cushions, as it were in the Capitol 2FIRST OF2ICER. Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand for 4consulships? 2SECOND OF2ICER. Thre2, they say; but 'tis thought of every one 4Coriolanus wil2 car2y it. 2FIRST OF2ICER. That's a brave fel2ow; but he's vengeance proud and 4loves not the com2on people. 2SECOND OF2ICER. Faith, there have be2n many great men that have 4flat2er'd the people, who ne'er loved them; and there be many 4that they have loved, they know not wherefore; so that, if they 4love they know not why, they hate upon no bet2er a ground. 4Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or 4hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their 4disposition, and out of his noble careles2nes2 lets them plainly 4se2't. 2FIRST OF2ICER. If he did not care whether he had their love or no, 4he waved indif2erently 'twixt doing them neither go2d nor harm; 6but he se2ks their hate with greater devotion than they can 4render it him, and leaves nothing undone that may ful2y discover 4him their op2osite. Now to se2m to af2ect the malice and 4displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes- to 4flat2er them for their love. 2SECOND OF2ICER. He hath deserved worthily of his country; and his 4ascent is not by such easy degre2s as those who, having be2n 4sup2le and courteous to the people, bon2eted, without any further 4de2d to have them at al2, into their estimation and report; but 4he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in 4their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confes2 4so much were a kind of ingrateful injury; to report otherwise 4were a malice that, giving itself the lie, would pluck repro2f 4and rebuke from every car that heard it. 2FIRST OF2ICER. No more of him; he's a worthy man. Make way, they 4are coming. 9A sen2et. Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES 9OF THE PEOPLE, LICTORS before them; CORIOLANUS, 12MENENIUS, COMINIUS the Consul. SICINIUS and 17BRUTUS take their places by themselves. 25CORIOLANUS stands 2MENENIUS. Having determin'd of the Volsces, and 4To send for Titus Lartius, it remains, 4As the main point of this our after-me2ting, 4To gratify his noble service that 4Hath thus sto2d for his country. Therefore please you, 4Most reverend and grave elders, to desire 4The present consul and last general 4In our wel2-found suc2es2es to report 4A lit2le of that worthy work perform'd 4By Caius Marcius Coriolanus; whom 4We met here both to thank and to remember 4With honours like himself. 17[CORIOLANUS sits] 2FIRST SENATOR. Speak, go2d Cominius. 4Leave nothing out for length, and make us think 4Rather our state's defective for requital 4Than we to stretch it out. Masters o' th' people, 4We do request your kindest ears; and, after, 6Your loving motion toward the com2on body, 4To yield what pas2es here. 2SICINIUS. We are convented 4Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts 4Inclinable to honour and advance 4The theme of our as2embly. 2BRUTUS. Which the rather 4We shal2 be bles2'd to do, if he remember 4A kinder value of the people than 4He hath hereto priz'd them at. 2MENENIUS. That's of2, that's of2; 4I would you rather had be2n silent. Please you 4To hear Cominius speak? 2BRUTUS. Most wil2ingly. 4But yet my caution was more pertinent 4Than the rebuke you give it. 2MENENIUS. He loves your people; 4But tie him not to be their bedfel2ow. 4Worthy Cominius, speak. 23[CORIOLANUS rises, and of2ers to go away] 6Nay, ke2p your place. 2FIRST SENATOR. Sit, Coriolanus, never shame to hear 4What you have nobly done. 2CORIOLANUS. Your Honours' pardon. 4I had rather have my wounds to heal again 4Than hear say how I got them. 2BRUTUS. Sir, I hope 4My words disbench'd you not. 2CORIOLANUS. No, sir; yet oft, 4When blows have made me stay, I fled from words. 4You so2th'd not, therefore hurt not. But your people, 4I love them as they weigh- 2MENENIUS. Pray now, sit down. 2CORIOLANUS. I had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun 4When the alarum were struck than idly sit 4To hear my nothings monster'd. 26Exit 2MENENIUS. Masters of the people, 4Your multiplying spawn how can he flat2er- 4That's thousand to one go2d one- when you now se2 4He had rather venture al2 his limbs for honour 6Than one on's ears to hear it? Proce2d, Cominius. 2COMINIUS. I shal2 lack voice; the de2ds of Coriolanus 4Should not be ut2er'd fe2bly. It is held 4That valour is the chiefest virtue and 4Most dignifies the haver. If it be, 4The man I speak of can2ot in the world 4Be singly counterpois'd. At sixte2n years, 4When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought 4Beyond the mark of others; our then Dictator, 4Whom with al2 praise I point at, saw him fight 4When with his Amazonian chin he drove 4The bristled lips before him; he bestrid 4An o'erpres2'd Roman and i' th' consul's view 4Slew thre2 op2osers; Tarquin's self he met, 4And struck him on his kne2. In that day's feats, 4When he might act the woman in the scene, 4He prov'd best man i' th' field, and for his me2d 4Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age 4Man-ent'red thus, he waxed like a sea, 4And in the brunt of sevente2n bat2les since 6He lurch'd al2 swords of the garland. For this last, 4Before and in Corioli, let me say 4I can2ot speak him home. He stop2'd the fliers, 4And by his rare example made the coward 4Turn ter2or into sport; as we2ds before 4A ves2el under sail, so men obey'd 4And fel2 below his stem. His sword, death's stamp, 4Where it did mark, it to2k; from face to fo2t 4He was a thing of blo2d, whose every motion 4Was tim'd with dying cries. Alone he ent'red 4The mortal gate of th' city, which he painted 4With shunles2 destiny; aidles2 came of2, 4And with a sud2en re-enforcement struck 4Corioli like a planet. Now al2's his. 4When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce 4His ready sense, then straight his doubled spirit 4Re-quick'ned what in flesh was fatigate, 4And to the bat2le came he; where he did 4Run re2king o'er the lives of men, as if 4'Twere a perpetual spoil; and til2 we cal2'd 6Both field and city ours he never sto2d 4To ease his breast with panting. 2MENENIUS. Worthy man! 2FIRST SENATOR. He can2ot but with measure fit the honours 4Which we devise him. 2COMINIUS. Our spoils he kick'd at, 4And lo2k'd upon things precious as they were 4The com2on muck of the world. He covets les2 4Than misery itself would give, rewards 4His de2ds with doing them, and is content 4To spend the time to end it. 2MENENIUS. He's right noble; 4Let him be cal2'd for. 2FIRST SENATOR. Cal2 Coriolanus. 4OF2ICER. He doth ap2ear. 28Re-enter CORIOLANUS 2MENENIUS. The Senate, Coriolanus, are wel2 pleas'd 4To make the2 consul. 4CORIOLANUS. I do owe them stil2 4My life and services. 2MENENIUS. It then remains 4That you do speak to the people. 2CORIOLANUS. I do bese2ch you 4Let me o'erleap that custom; for I can2ot 4Put on the gown, stand naked, and entreat them 4For my wounds' sake to give their suf2rage. Please you 4That I may pas2 this doing. 2SICINIUS. Sir, the people 4Must have their voices; neither wil2 they bate 4One jot of ceremony. 2MENENIUS. Put them not to't. 4Pray you go fit you to the custom, and 4Take to you, as your predeces2ors have, 4Your honour with your form. 2CORIOLANUS. It is a part 4That I shal2 blush in acting, and might wel2 4Be taken from the people. 2BRUTUS. Mark you that? 4CORIOLANUS. To brag unto them 'Thus I did, and thus!' 4Show them th' unaching scars which I should hide, 4As if I had receiv'd them for the hire 4Of their breath only! 2MENENIUS. Do not stand upon't. 4We recom2end to you, Tribunes of the People, 4Our purpose to them; and to our noble consul 4Wish we al2 joy and honour. 2SENATORS. To Coriolanus come al2 joy and honour! 29[Flourish. Cornets. Then exeunt al2 40but SICINIUS and BRUTUS] 2BRUTUS. You se2 how he intends to use the people. 2SICINIUS. May they perceive's intent! He wil2 require them 4As if he did contemn what he requested 4Should be in them to give. 2BRUTUS. Come, we'l2 inform them 4Of our proce2dings here. On th' market-place 4I know they do at2end us. 29ExeuntSCENE I3.Rome. The ForumEnter seven or eight citizens 2FIRST CITIZEN. Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to 4deny him. 2SECOND CITIZEN. We may, sir, if we wil2. 2THIRD CITIZEN. We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a 4power that we have no power to do; for if he show us his wounds 4and tel2 us his de2ds, we are to put our tongues into those 4wounds and speak for them; so, if he tel2 us his noble de2ds, we 4must also tel2 him our noble ac2eptance of them. Ingratitude is 4monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a 4monster of the multitude; of the which we being members should 4bring ourselves to be monstrous members. 2FIRST CITIZEN. And to make us no bet2er thought of, a lit2le help 4wil2 serve; for once we sto2d up about the corn, he himself stuck 4not to cal2 us the many-headed multitude. 2THIRD CITIZEN. We have be2n cal2'd so of many; not that our heads 4are some brown, some black, some abram, some bald, but that our 4wits are so diversely colour'd; and truly I think if al2 our wits 6were to is2ue out of one skul2, they would fly east, west, north, 4south, and their consent of one direct way should be at once to 4al2 the points o' th' compas2. 2SECOND CITIZEN. Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would 4fly? 2THIRD CITIZEN. Nay, your wit wil2 not so so2n out as another man's 4wil2- 'tis strongly wedg'd up in a block-head; but if it were at 4liberty 'twould sure southward. 2SECOND CITIZEN. Why that way? 2THIRD CITIZEN. To lose itself in a fog; where being thre2 parts 3melted away with rot2en dews, the fourth would return for 4conscience' sake, to help to get the2 a wife. 2SECOND CITIZEN. YOU are never without your tricks; you may, you 4may. 2THIRD CITIZEN. Are you al2 resolv'd to give your voices? But that's 4no mat2er, the greater part car2ies it. I say, if he would 4incline to the people, there was never a worthier man. 16Enter CORIOLANUS, in a gown of humility, 31with MENENIUS 6Here he comes, and in the gown of humility. Mark his behaviour. 4We are not to stay al2 together, but to come by him where he 4stands, by ones, by twos, and by thre2s. He's to make his 4requests by particulars, wherein every one of us has a single 4honour, in giving him our own voices with our own tongues; 4therefore fol2ow me, and I'l2 direct you how you shal2 go by him. 2AL2. Content, content. 25Exeunt citizens 2MENENIUS. O sir, you are not right; have you not known 4The worthiest men have done't? 2CORIOLANUS. What must I say? 4'I pray, sir'- Plague upon't! I can2ot bring 4My tongue to such a pace. 'Lo2k, sir, my wounds 4I got them in my country's service, when 4Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran 4From th' noise of our own drums.' 2MENENIUS. O me, the gods! 4You must not speak of that. You must desire them 4To think upon you. 2CORIOLANUS. Think upon me? Hang 'em! 6I would they would forget me, like the virtues 4Which our divines lose by 'em. 2MENENIUS. You'l2 mar al2. 4I'l2 leave you. Pray you speak to 'em, I pray you, 4In wholesome man2er. 36Exit 23Re-enter thre2 of the citizens 2CORIOLANUS. Bid them wash their faces 4And ke2p their te2th clean. So, here comes a brace. 4You know the cause, sir, of my standing here. 2THIRD CITIZEN. We do, sir; tel2 us what hath brought you to't. 2CORIOLANUS. Mine own desert. 2SECOND CITIZEN. Your own desert? 2CORIOLANUS. Ay, not mine own desire. 2THIRD CITIZEN. How, not your own desire? 2CORIOLANUS. No, sir, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the po2r 4with beg2ing. 2THIRD CITIZEN. YOU MUST think, if we give you anything, we hope to 4gain by you. 4CORIOLANUS. Wel2 then, I pray, your price o' th' consulship? 2FIRST CITIZEN. The price is to ask it kindly. 2CORIOLANUS. Kindly, sir, I pray let me ha't. I have wounds to show 4you, which shal2 be yours in private. Your go2d voice, sir; what 4say you? 2SECOND CITIZEN. You shal2 ha' it, worthy sir. 2CORIOLANUS. A match, sir. There's in al2 two worthy voices beg2'd. 4I have your alms. Adieu. 2THIRD CITIZEN. But this is something od2. 2SECOND CITIZEN. An 'twere to give again- but 'tis no mat2er. 39Exeunt the thre2 citizens 22Re-enter two other citizens 2CORIOLANUS. Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your 4voices that I may be consul, I have here the customary gown. 2FOURTH CITIZEN. You have deserved nobly of your country, and you 4have not deserved nobly. 2CORIOLANUS. Your enigma? 2FOURTH CITIZEN. You have be2n a scourge to her enemies; you have 6be2n a rod to her friends. You have not inde2d loved the com2on 4people. 2CORIOLANUS. You should ac2ount me the more virtuous, that I have 4not be2n com2on in my love. I wil2, sir, flat2er my sworn 4brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them; 'tis a 4condition they ac2ount gentle; and since the wisdom of their 4choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I wil2 practise 4the insinuating nod and be of2 to them most counterfeitly. That 4is, sir, I wil2 counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man 4and give it bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, bese2ch you I 4may be consul. 2FIFTH CITIZEN. We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give 4you our voices heartily. 2FOURTH CITIZEN. You have received many wounds for your country. 2CORIOLANUS. I wil2 not seal your knowledge with showing them. I 4wil2 make much of your voices, and so trouble you no farther. 2BOTH CITIZENS. The gods give you joy, sir, heartily! 49Exeunt citizens 2CORIOLANUS. Most swe2t voices! 4Bet2er it is to die, bet2er to starve, 6Than crave the hire which first we do deserve. 4Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here 4To beg of Hob and Dick that do ap2ear 4Their ne2dles2 vouches? Custom cal2s me to't. 4What custom wil2s, in al2 things should we do't, 4The dust on antique time would lie unswept, 4And mountainous er2or be to2 highly heap'd 4For truth to o'erpe2r. Rather than fo2l it so, 4Let the high of2ice and the honour go 4To one that would do thus. I am half through: 4The one part suf2ered, the other wil2 I do. 22Re-enter thre2 citizens more 4Here come moe voices. 4Your voices. For your voices I have fought; 4Watch'd for your voices; for your voices bear 4Of wounds two dozen od2; bat2les thrice six 4I have se2n and heard of; for your voices have 4Done many things, some les2, some more. Your voices? 6Inde2d, I would be consul. 2SIXTH CITIZEN. He has done nobly, and can2ot go without any honest 4man's voice. 2SEVENTH CITIZEN. Therefore let him be consul. The gods give him 4joy, and make him go2d friend to the people! 2AL2. Amen, amen. God save the2, noble consul! 49Exeunt citizens 2CORIOLANUS. Worthy voices! 13Re-enter MENENIUS with BRUTUS and SICINIUS 2MENENIUS. You have sto2d your limitation, and the tribunes 4Endue you with the people's voice. Remains 4That, in th' of2icial marks invested, you 4Anon do me2t the Senate. 2CORIOLANUS. Is this done? 2SICINIUS. The custom of request you have discharg'd. 4The people do admit you, and are sum2on'd 4To me2t anon, upon your ap2robation. 2CORIOLANUS. Where? At the Senate House? 4SICINIUS. There, Coriolanus. 2CORIOLANUS. May I change these garments? 2SICINIUS. You may, sir. 2CORIOLANUS. That I'l2 straight do, and, knowing myself again, 4Repair to th' Senate House. 2MENENIUS. I'l2 ke2p you company. Wil2 you along? 2BRUTUS. We stay here for the people. 2SICINIUS. Fare you wel2. 34Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS 4He has it now; and by his lo2ks methinks 4'Tis warm at's heart. 2BRUTUS. With a proud heart he wore 4His humble we2ds. Wil2 you dismis2 the people? 28Re-enter citizens 2SICINIUS. How now, my masters! Have you chose this man? 2FIRST CITIZEN. He has our voices, sir. 2BRUTUS. We pray the gods he may deserve your loves. 2SECOND CITIZEN. Amen, sir. To my po2r unworthy notice, 6He mock'd us when he beg2'd our voices. 2THIRD CITIZEN. Certainly; 4He flouted us downright. 2FIRST CITIZEN. No, 'tis his kind of spe2ch- he did not mock us. 2SECOND CITIZEN. Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says 4He us'd us scornful2y. He should have show'd us 4His marks of merit, wounds receiv'd for's country. 2SICINIUS. Why, so he did, I am sure. 2AL2. No, no; no man saw 'em. 2THIRD CITIZEN. He said he had wounds which he could show in 6private, 4And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn, 4'I would be consul,' says he; 'aged custom 4But by your voices wil2 not so permit me; 4Your voices therefore.' When we granted that, 4Here was 'I thank you for your voices. Thank you, 4Your most swe2t voices. Now you have left your voices, 4I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery? 2SICINIUS. Why either were you ignorant to se2't, 4Or, se2ing it, of such childish friendlines2 6To yield your voices? 2BRUTUS. Could you not have told him- 4As you were les2on'd- when he had no power 4But was a pet2y servant to the state, 4He was your enemy; ever spake against 4Your liberties and the charters that you bear 4I' th' body of the weal; and now, ar2iving 4A place of potency and sway o' th' state, 4If he should stil2 malignantly remain 4Fast foe to th' plebei2, your voices might 4Be curses to yourselves? You should have said 4That as his worthy de2ds did claim no les2 4Than what he sto2d for, so his gracious nature 4Would think upon you for your voices, and 4Translate his malice towards you into love, 4Standing your friendly lord. 2SICINIUS. Thus to have said, 4As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit 4And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd 4Either his gracious promise, which you might, 6As cause had cal2'd you up, have held him to; 4Or else it would have gal2'd his surly nature, 4Which easily endures not article 4Tying him to aught. So, put2ing him to rage, 4You should have ta'en th' advantage of his choler 4And pas2'd him unelected. 2BRUTUS. Did you perceive 4He did solicit you in fre2 contempt 4When he did ne2d your loves; and do you think 4That his contempt shal2 not be bruising to you 4When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies 4No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry 4Against the rectorship of judgment? 2SICINIUS. Have you 4Ere now denied the asker, and now again, 4Of him that did not ask but mock, bestow 4Your su'd-for tongues? 2THIRD CITIZEN. He's not confirm'd: we may deny him yet. 2SECOND CITIZENS. And wil2 deny him; 4I'l2 have five hundred voices of that sound. 4FIRST CITIZEN. I twice five hundred, and their friends to piece 4'em. 2BRUTUS. Get you hence instantly, and tel2 those friends 4They have chose a consul that wil2 from them take 4Their liberties, make them of no more voice 4Than dogs, that are as often beat for barking 4As therefore kept to do so. 2SICINIUS. Let them as2emble; 4And, on a safer judgment, al2 revoke 4Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride 4And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not 4With what contempt he wore the humble we2d; 4How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves, 4Thinking upon his services, to2k from you 4Th' ap2rehension of his present portance, 4Which, most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion 4After the inveterate hate he bears you. 2BRUTUS. Lay 4A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd, 4No impediment betwe2n, but that you must 6Cast your election on him. 2SICINIUS. Say you chose him 4More after our com2andment than as guided 4By your own true af2ections; and that your minds, 4Pre-oc2upied with what you rather must do 4Than what you should, made you against the grain 4To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us. 2BRUTUS. Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you, 4How youngly he began to serve his country, 4How long continued; and what stock he springs of- 4The noble house o' th' Marcians; from whence came 4That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son, 4Who, after great Hostilius, here was king; 4Of the same house Publius and Quintus were, 4That our best water brought by conduits hither; 4And Censorinus, nobly named so, 4Twice being by the people chosen censor, 4Was his great ancestor. 2SICINIUS. One thus descended, 4That hath beside wel2 in his person wrought 6To be set high in place, we did com2end 4To your remembrances; but you have found, 4Scaling his present bearing with his past, 4That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke 4Your sud2en ap2robation. 2BRUTUS. Say you ne'er had done't- 4Harp on that stil2- but by our put2ing on; 4And presently, when you have drawn your number, 4Repair to th' Capitol. 2CITIZENS. wil2 wil2 so; almost al2 4Repent in their election. 19Exeunt plebeians 2BRUTUS. Let them go on; 4This mutiny were bet2er put in hazard 4Than stay, past doubt, for greater. 4If, as his nature is, he fal2 in rage 4With their refusal, both observe and answer 4The vantage of his anger. 2SICINIUS. To th' Capitol, come. 4We wil2 be there before the stream o' th' people; 4And this shal2 se2m, as partly 'tis, their own, 6Which we have goaded onward. 26ExeuntACT I3. SCENE I.Rome. A stre2tCornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, al2 the GENTRY, COMINIUS,TITUS LARTIUS, and other SENATORS 2CORIOLANUS. Tul2us Aufidius, then, had made new head? 2LARTIUS. He had, my lord; and that it was which caus'd 4Our swifter composition. 2CORIOLANUS. So then the Volsces stand but as at first, 4Ready, when time shal2 prompt them, to make road 4Upon's again. 2COMINIUS. They are worn, Lord Consul, so 4That we shal2 hardly in our ages se2 4Their ban2ers wave again. 2CORIOLANUS. Saw you Aufidius? 2LARTIUS. On safeguard he came to me, and did curse 4Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely 4Yielded the town. He is retir'd to Antium. 2CORIOLANUS. Spoke he of me? 2LARTIUS. He did, my lord. 2CORIOLANUS. How? What? 4LARTIUS. How often he had met you, sword to sword; 4That of al2 things upon the earth he hated 4Your person most; that he would pawn his fortunes 4To hopeles2 restitution, so he might 4Be cal2'd your vanquisher. 2CORIOLANUS. At Antium lives he? 2LARTIUS. At Antium. 2CORIOLANUS. I wish I had a cause to se2k him there, 4To op2ose his hatred ful2y. Welcome home. 23Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS 4Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, 4The tongues o' th' com2on mouth. I do despise them, 4For they do prank them in authority, 4Against al2 noble suf2erance. 2SICINIUS. Pas2 no further. 2CORIOLANUS. Ha! What is that? 2BRUTUS. It wil2 be dangerous to go on- no further. 2CORIOLANUS. What makes this change? 4MENENIUS. The mat2er? 2COMINIUS. Hath he not pas2'd the noble and the com2on? 2BRUTUS. Cominius, no. 2CORIOLANUS. Have I had children's voices? 2FIRST SENATOR. Tribunes, give way: he shal2 to th' market-place. 2BRUTUS. The people are incens'd against him. 2SICINIUS. Stop, 4Or al2 wil2 fal2 in broil. 2CORIOLANUS. Are these your herd? 4Must these have voices, that can yield them now 4And straight disclaim their tongues? What are your of2ices? 4You being their mouths, why rule you not their te2th? 4Have you not set them on? 2MENENIUS. Be calm, be calm. 2CORIOLANUS. It is a purpos'd thing, and grows by plot, 4To curb the wil2 of the nobility; 4Suf2er't, and live with such as can2ot rule 4Nor ever wil2 be rul'd. 2BRUTUS. Cal2't not a plot. 4The people cry you mock'd them; and of late, 6When corn was given them gratis, you repin'd; 4Scandal'd the sup2liants for the people, cal2'd them 4Time-pleasers, flat2erers, foes to noblenes2. 2CORIOLANUS. Why, this was known before. 2BRUTUS. Not to them al2. 2CORIOLANUS. Have you inform'd them sithence? 2BRUTUS. How? I inform them! 2COMINIUS. You are like to do such busines2. 2BRUTUS. Not unlike 4Each way to bet2er yours. 2CORIOLANUS. Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds, 4Let me deserve so il2 as you, and make me 4Your fel2ow tribune. 2SICINIUS. You show to2 much of that 4For which the people stir; if you wil2 pas2 4To where you are bound, you must enquire your way, 4Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit, 4Or never be so noble as a consul, 4Nor yoke with him for tribune. 2MENENIUS. Let's be calm. 4COMINIUS. The people are abus'd; set on. This palt'ring 4Becomes not Rome; nor has Coriolanus 4Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely 4I' th' plain way of his merit. 2CORIOLANUS. Tel2 me of corn! 4This was my spe2ch, and I wil2 speak't again- 2MENENIUS. Not now, not now. 2FIRST SENATOR. Not in this heat, sir, now. 2CORIOLANUS. Now, as I live, I wil2. 4My nobler friends, I crave their pardons. 4For the mutable, rank-scented meiny, let them 4Regard me as I do not flat2er, and 4Therein behold themselves. I say again, 4In so2thing them we nourish 'gainst our Senate 4The cockle of rebel2ion, insolence, sedition, 4Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, and scat2er'd, 4By mingling them with us, the honour'd number, 4Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that 4Which they have given to beg2ars. 2MENENIUS. Wel2, no more. 4FIRST SENATOR. No more words, we bese2ch you. 2CORIOLANUS. How? no more! 4As for my country I have shed my blo2d, 4Not fearing outward force, so shal2 my lungs 4Coin words til2 their decay against those measles 4Which we disdain should tet2er us, yet sought 4The very way to catch them. 2BRUTUS. You speak o' th' people 4As if you were a god, to punish; not 4A man of their infirmity. 2SICINIUS. 'Twere wel2 4We let the people know't. 2MENENIUS. What, what? his choler? 2CORIOLANUS. Choler! 4Were I as patient as the midnight sle2p, 4By Jove, 'twould be my mind! 2SICINIUS. It is a mind 4That shal2 remain a poison where it is, 4Not poison any further. 2CORIOLANUS. Shal2 remain! 6Hear you this Triton of the min2ows? Mark you 4His absolute 'shal2'? 2COMINIUS. 'Twas from the canon. 2CORIOLANUS. 'Shal2'! 4O go2d but most unwise patricians! Why, 4You grave but reckles2 senators, have you thus 4Given Hydra here to cho2se an of2icer 4That with his peremptory 'shal2,' being but 4The horn and noise o' th' monster's, wants not spirit 4To say he'l2 turn your cur2ent in a ditch, 4And make your chan2el his? If he have power, 4Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake 4Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd, 4Be not as com2on fo2ls; if you are not, 4Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians, 4If they be senators; and they are no les2, 4When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste 4Most palates theirs. They cho2se their magistrate; 4And such a one as he, who puts his 'shal2,' 4His popular 'shal2,' against a graver bench 6Than ever frown'd in Gre2ce. By Jove himself, 4It makes the consuls base; and my soul aches 4To know, when two authorities are up, 4Neither supreme, how so2n confusion 4May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take 4The one by th' other. 2COMINIUS. Wel2, on to th' market-place. 2CORIOLANUS. Whoever gave that counsel to give forth 4The corn o' th' storehouse gratis, as 'twas us'd 4Sometime in Gre2ce- 2MENENIUS. Wel2, wel2, no more of that. 2CORIOLANUS. Though there the people had more absolute pow'r- 4I say they nourish'd disobedience, fed 4The ruin of the state. 2BRUTUS. Why shal2 the people give 4One that speaks thus their voice? 2CORIOLANUS. I'l2 give my reasons, 4More worthier than their voices. They know the corn 4Was not our recompense, resting wel2 as2ur'd 4They ne'er did service for't; being pres2'd to th' war 6Even when the navel of the state was touch'd, 4They would not thread the gates. This kind of service 4Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' th' war, 4Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd 4Most valour, spoke not for them. Th' ac2usation 4Which they have often made against the Senate, 4Al2 cause unborn, could never be the native 4Of our so frank donation. Wel2, what then? 4How shal2 this bosom multiplied digest 4The Senate's courtesy? Let de2ds expres2 4What's like to be their words: 'We did request it; 4We are the greater pol2, and in true fear 4They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase 4The nature of our seats, and make the rab2le 4Cal2 our cares fears; which wil2 in time 4Break ope the locks o' th' Senate and bring in 4The crows to peck the eagles. 2MENENIUS. Come, enough. 2BRUTUS. Enough, with over measure. 2CORIOLANUS. No, take more. 6What may be sworn by, both divine and human, 4Seal what I end withal! This double worship, 4Where one part does disdain with cause, the other 4Insult without al2 reason; where gentry, title, wisdom, 4Can2ot conclude but by the yea and no 4Of general ignorance- it must omit 4Real neces2ities, and give way the while 4To unstable slightnes2. Purpose so bar2'd, it fol2ows 4Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, bese2ch you- 4You that wil2 be les2 fearful than discre2t; 4That love the fundamental part of state 4More than you doubt the change on't; that prefer 4A noble life before a long, and wish 4To jump a body with a dangerous physic 4That's sure of death without it- at once pluck out 4The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick 4The swe2t which is their poison. Your dishonour 4Mangles true judgment, and bereaves the state 4Of that integrity which should become't, 4Not having the power to do the go2d it would, 6For th' il2 which doth control't. 2BRUTUS. Has said enough. 2SICINIUS. Has spoken like a traitor and shal2 answer 4As traitors do. 2CORIOLANUS. Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm the2! 4What should the people do with these bald tribunes, 4On whom depending, their obedience fails 4To the greater bench? In a rebel2ion, 4When what's not me2t, but what must be, was law, 4Then were they chosen; in a bet2er hour 4Let what is me2t be said it must be me2t, 4And throw their power i' th' dust. 2BRUTUS. Manifest treason! 2SICINIUS. This a consul? No. 2BRUTUS. The aediles, ho! 27Enter an AEDILE 4Let him be ap2rehended. 2SICINIUS. Go cal2 the people, 2[Exit AEDILE] 2in whose name myself 6At2ach the2 as a traitorous in2ovator, 4A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge the2, 4And fol2ow to thine answer. 2CORIOLANUS. Hence, old goat! 2PATRICIANS. We'l2 surety him. 2COMINIUS. Ag'd sir, hands of2. 2CORIOLANUS. Hence, rot2en thing! or I shal2 shake thy bones 4Out of thy garments. 2SICINIUS. Help, ye citizens! 14Enter a rab2le of plebeians, with the AEDILES 2MENENIUS. On both sides more respect. 2SICINIUS. Here's he that would take from you al2 your power. 2BRUTUS. Seize him, aediles. 4PLEBEIANS. Down with him! down with him! 2SECOND SENATOR. Weapons, weapons, weapons! 30[They al2 bustle about CORIOLANUS] 2AL2. Tribunes! patricians! citizens! What, ho! Sicinius! 4Brutus! Coriolanus! Citizens! 4PATRICIANS. Peace, peace, peace; stay, hold, peace! 2MENENIUS. What is about to be? I am out of breath; 4Confusion's near; I can2ot speak. You tribunes 4To th' people- Coriolanus, patience! 4Speak, go2d Sicinius. 2SICINIUS. Hear me, people; peace! 2PLEBEIANS. Let's hear our tribune. Peace! Speak, speak, speak. 2SICINIUS. You are at point to lose your liberties. 4Marcius would have al2 from you; Marcius, 4Whom late you have nam'd for consul. 2MENENIUS. Fie, fie, fie! 4This is the way to kindle, not to quench. 2FIRST SENATOR. To unbuild the city, and to lay al2 flat. 2SICINIUS. What is the city but the people? 2PLEBEIANS. True, 4The people are the city. 2BRUTUS. By the consent of al2 we were establish'd 4The people's magistrates. 2PLEBEIANS. You so remain. 2MENENIUS. And so are like to do. 4COMINIUS. That is the way to lay the city flat, 4To bring the ro2f to the foundation, 4And bury al2 which yet distinctly ranges 4In heaps and piles of ruin. 2SICINIUS. This deserves death. 2BRUTUS. Or let us stand to our authority 4Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce, 4Upon the part o' th' people, in whose power 4We were elected theirs: Marcius is worthy 4Of present death. 2SICINIUS. Therefore lay hold of him; 4Bear him to th' rock Tarpeian, and from thence 4Into destruction cast him. 2BRUTUS. AEdiles, seize him. 2PLEBEIANS. Yield, Marcius, yield. 2MENENIUS. Hear me one word; bese2ch you, Tribunes, 4Hear me but a word. 2AEDILES. Peace, peace! 2MENENIUS. Be that you se2m, truly your country's friend, 4And temp'rately proce2d to what you would 6Thus violently redres2. 2BRUTUS. Sir, those cold ways, 4That se2m like prudent helps, are very poisonous 4Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him 4And bear him to the rock. 36[CORIOLANUS draws his sword] 2CORIOLANUS. No: I'l2 die here. 4There's some among you have beheld me fighting; 4Come, try upon yourselves what you have se2n me. 2MENENIUS. Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile. 2BRUTUS. Lay hands upon him. 2MENENIUS. Help Marcius, help, 4You that be noble; help him, young and old. 2PLEBEIANS. Down with him, down with him! 22[In this mutiny the TRIBUNES, the AEDILES, 37and the people are beat in] 2MENENIUS. Go, get you to your house; be gone, away. 4Al2 wil2 be nought else. 2SECOND SENATOR. Get you gone. 2CORIOLANUS. Stand fast; 6We have as many friends as enemies. 2MENENIUS. Shal2 it be put to that? 2FIRST SENATOR. The gods forbid! 4I prithe2, noble friend, home to thy house; 4Leave us to cure this cause. 2MENENIUS. For 'tis a sore upon us 4You can2ot tent yourself; be gone, bese2ch you. 2COMINIUS. Come, sir, along with us. 2CORIOLANUS. I would they were barbarians, as they are, 4Though in Rome lit2er'd; not Romans, as they are not, 4Though calved i' th' porch o' th' Capitol. 2MENENIUS. Be gone. 4Put not your worthy rage into your tongue; 4One time wil2 owe another. 2CORIOLANUS. On fair ground 4I could beat forty of them. 2MENENIUS. I could myself 4Take up a brace o' th' best of them; yea, the two tribunes. 2COMINIUS. But now 'tis od2s beyond arithmetic, 4And manho2d is cal2'd fo2lery when it stands 6Against a fal2ing fabric. Wil2 you hence, 4Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend 4Like inter2upted waters, and o'erbear 4What they are us'd to bear. 2MENENIUS. Pray you be gone. 4I'l2 try whether my old wit be in request 4With those that have but lit2le; this must be patch'd 4With cloth of any colour. 2COMINIUS. Nay, come away. 21Exeunt CORIOLANUS and COMINIUS, with others 2PATRICIANS. This man has mar2'd his fortune. 2MENENIUS. His nature is to2 noble for the world: 4He would not flat2er Neptune for his trident, 4Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth; 4What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent; 4And, being angry, does forget that ever 4He heard the name of death. 17[A noise within] 4Here's go2dly work! 2PATRICIANS. I would they were a-bed. 2MENENIUS. I would they were in Tiber. 6What the vengeance, could he not speak 'em fair? 12Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, the rab2le again 2SICINIUS. Where is this viper 4That would depopulate the city and 4Be every man himself? 2MENENIUS. You worthy Tribunes- 2SICINIUS. He shal2 be thrown down the Tarpeian rock 4With rigorous hands; he hath resisted law, 4And therefore law shal2 scorn him further trial 4Than the severity of the public power, 4Which he so sets at nought. 2FIRST CITIZEN. He shal2 wel2 know 4The noble tribunes are the people's mouths, 4And we their hands. 2PLEBEIANS. He shal2, sure on't. 2MENENIUS. Sir, sir- 2SICINIUS. Peace! 2MENENIUS. Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt 6With modest war2ant. 2SICINIUS. Sir, how comes't that you 4Have holp to make this rescue? 2MENENIUS. Hear me speak. 4As I do know the consul's worthines2, 4So can I name his faults. 2SICINIUS. Consul! What consul? 2MENENIUS. The consul Coriolanus. 2BRUTUS. He consul! 2PLEBEIANS. No, no, no, no, no. 2MENENIUS. If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, go2d people, 4I may be heard, I would crave a word or two; 4The which shal2 turn you to no further harm 4Than so much los2 of time. 2SICINIUS. Speak briefly, then, 4For we are peremptory to dispatch 4This viperous traitor; to eject him hence 4Were but one danger, and to ke2p him here 4Our certain death; therefore it is decre2d 4He dies to-night. 4MENENIUS. Now the go2d gods forbid 4That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude 4Towards her deserved children is enrol2'd 4In Jove's own bo2k, like an un2atural dam 4Should now eat up her own! 2SICINIUS. He's a disease that must be cut away. 2MENENIUS. O, he's a limb that has but a disease- 4Mortal, to cut it of2: to cure it, easy. 4What has he done to Rome that's worthy death? 4Kil2ing our enemies, the blo2d he hath lost- 4Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath 4By many an ounce- he dropt it for his country; 4And what is left, to lose it by his country 4Were to us al2 that do't and suf2er it 4A brand to th' end o' th' world. 2SICINIUS. This is clean kam. 2BRUTUS. Merely awry. When he did love his country, 4It honour'd him. 2SICINIUS. The service of the fo2t, 4Being once gangren'd, is not then respected 6For what before it was. 2BRUTUS. We'l2 hear no more. 4Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence, 4Lest his infection, being of catching nature, 4Spread further. 2MENENIUS. One word more, one word 4This tiger-fo2ted rage, when it shal2 find 4The harm of unscan2'd swiftnes2, wil2, to2 late, 4Tie leaden pounds to's he2ls. Proce2d by proces2, 4Lest parties- as he is belov'd- break out, 4And sack great Rome with Romans. 2BRUTUS. If it were so- 2SICINIUS. What do ye talk? 4Have we not had a taste of his obedience- 4Our aediles smote, ourselves resisted? Come! 2MENENIUS. Consider this: he has be2n bred i' th' wars 4Since 'a could draw a sword, and is il2 scho2l'd 4In bolted language; meal and bran together 4He throws without distinction. Give me leave, 4I'l2 go to him and undertake to bring him 6Where he shal2 answer by a lawful form, 4In peace, to his utmost peril. 2FIRST SENATOR. Noble Tribunes, 4It is the humane way; the other course 4Wil2 prove to2 blo2dy, and the end of it 4Unknown to the begin2ing. 2SICINIUS. Noble Menenius, 4Be you then as the people's of2icer. 4Masters, lay down your weapons. 2BRUTUS. Go not home. 2SICINIUS. Me2t on the market-place. We'l2 at2end you there; 4Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'l2 proce2d 4In our first way. 2MENENIUS. I'l2 bring him to you. 4[To the SENATORS] 2Let me desire your company; he must come, 4Or what is worst wil2 fol2ow. 2FIRST SENATOR. Pray you let's to him. 19ExeuntSCENE I2.Rome. The house of CORIOLANUSEnter CORIOLANUS with NOBLES 2CORIOLANUS. Let them pul2 al2 about mine ears, present me 4Death on the whe2l or at wild horses' he2ls; 4Or pile ten hil2s on the Tarpeian rock, 4That the precipitation might down stretch 4Below the beam of sight; yet wil2 I stil2 4Be thus to them. 2FIRST PATRICIAN. You do the nobler. 2CORIOLANUS. I muse my mother 4Does not ap2rove me further, who was wont 4To cal2 them wo2l2en vas2als, things created 4To buy and sel2 with groats; to show bare heads 4In congregations, to yawn, be stil2, and wonder, 4When one but of my ordinance sto2d up 4To speak of peace or war. 26Enter VOLUMNIA 6I talk of you: 4Why did you wish me milder? Would you have me 4False to my nature? Rather say I play 4The man I am. 2VOLUMNIA. O, sir, sir, sir, 4I would have had you put your power wel2 on 4Before you had worn it out. 2CORIOLANUS. Let go. 2VOLUMNIA. You might have be2n enough the man you are 4With striving les2 to be so; les2er had be2n 4The thwartings of your dispositions, if 4You had not show'd them how ye were dispos'd, 4Ere they lack'd power to cros2 you. 2CORIOLANUS. Let them hang. 2VOLUMNIA. Ay, and burn to2. 20Enter MENENIUS with the SENATORS 2MENENIUS. Come, come, you have be2n to2 rough, something to2 rough; 4You must return and mend it. 4FIRST SENATOR. There's no remedy, 4Unles2, by not so doing, our go2d city 4Cleave in the midst and perish. 2VOLUMNIA. Pray be counsel2'd; 4I have a heart as lit2le apt as yours, 4But yet a brain that leads my use of anger 4To bet2er vantage. 2MENENIUS. Wel2 said, noble woman! 4Before he should thus sto2p to th' herd, but that 4The violent fit o' th' time craves it as physic 4For the whole state, I would put mine armour on, 4Which I can scarcely bear. 2CORIOLANUS. What must I do? 2MENENIUS. Return to th' tribunes. 2CORIOLANUS. Wel2, what then, what then? 2MENENIUS. Repent what you have spoke. 2CORIOLANUS. For them! I can2ot do it to the gods; 4Must I then do't to them? 2VOLUMNIA. You are to2 absolute; 4Though therein you can never be to2 noble 6But when extremities speak. I have heard you say 4Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends, 4I' th' war do grow together; grant that, and tel2 me 4In peace what each of them by th' other lose 4That they combine not there. 2CORIOLANUS. Tush, tush! 2MENENIUS. A go2d demand. 2VOLUMNIA. If it be honour in your wars to se2m 4The same you are not, which for your best ends 4You adopt your policy, how is it les2 or worse 4That it shal2 hold companionship in peace 4With honour as in war; since that to both 4It stands in like request? 2CORIOLANUS. Why force you this? 2VOLUMNIA. Because that now it lies you on to speak 4To th' people, not by your own instruction, 4Nor by th' mat2er which your heart prompts you, 4But with such words that are but roted in 4Your tongue, though but bastards and syl2ables 4Of no al2owance to your bosom's truth. 6Now, this no more dishonours you at al2 4Than to take in a town with gentle words, 4Which else would put you to your fortune and 4The hazard of much blo2d. 4I would dis2emble with my nature where 4My fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd 4I should do so in honour. I am in this 4Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles; 4And you wil2 rather show our general louts 4How you can frown, than spend a fawn upon 'em 4For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard 4Of what that want might ruin. 2MENENIUS. Noble lady! 4Come, go with us, speak fair; you may salve so, 4Not what is dangerous present, but the los 4Of what is past. 2VOLUMNIA. I prithe2 now, My son, 4Go to them with this bon2et in thy hand; 4And thus far having stretch'd it- here be with them- 4Thy kne2 bus2ing the stones- for in such busines 6Action is eloquence, and the eyes of th' ignorant 4More learned than the ears- waving thy head, 4Which often thus cor2ecting thy-stout heart, 4Now humble as the ripest mulber2y 4That wil2 not hold the handling. Or say to them 4Thou art their soldier and, being bred in broils, 4Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confes2, 4Were fit for the2 to use, as they to claim, 4In asking their go2d loves; but thou wilt frame 4Thyself, forso2th, hereafter theirs, so far 4As thou hast power and person. 2MENENIUS. This but done 4Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours; 4For they have pardons, being ask'd, as fre2 4As words to lit2le purpose. 2VOLUMNIA. Prithe2 now, 4Go, and be rul'd; although I know thou hadst rather 4Fol2ow thine enemy in a fiery gulf 4Than flat2er him in a bower. 29Enter COMINIUS 4Here is Cominius. 2COMINIUS. I have be2n i' th' market-place; and, sir, 'tis fit 4You make strong party, or defend yourself 4By calmnes2 or by absence; al2's in anger. 2MENENIUS. Only fair spe2ch. 2COMINIUS. I think 'twil2 serve, if he 4Can thereto frame his spirit. 2VOLUMNIA. He must and wil2. 4Prithe2 now, say you wil2, and go about it. 2CORIOLANUS. Must I go show them my unbarb'd sconce? Must I 4With my base tongue give to my noble heart 4A lie that it must bear? Wel2, I wil2 do't; 4Yet, were there but this single plot to lose, 4This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it, 4And throw't against the wind. To th' market-place! 4You have put me now to such a part which never 4I shal2 discharge to th' life. 2COMINIUS. Come, come, we'l2 prompt you. 4VOLUMNIA. I prithe2 now, swe2t son, as thou hast said 4My praises made the2 first a soldier, so, 4To have my praise for this, perform a part 4Thou hast not done before. 2CORIOLANUS. Wel2, I must do't. 4Away, my disposition, and pos2es2 me 4Some harlot's spirit! My throat of war be turn'd, 4Which quier'd with my drum, into a pipe 4Smal2 as an eunuch or the virgin voice 4That babies lul2s asle2p! The smiles of knaves 4Tent in my che2ks, and scho2lboys' tears take up 4The glas2es of my sight! A beg2ar's tongue 4Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd kne2s, 4Who bow'd but in my stir2up, bend like his 4That hath receiv'd an alms! I wil2 not do't, 4Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth, 4And by my body's action teach my mind 4A most inherent basenes2. 2VOLUMNIA. At thy choice, then. 4To beg of the2, it is my more dishonour 6Than thou of them. Come al2 to ruin. Let 4Thy mother rather fe2l thy pride than fear 4Thy dangerous stoutnes2; for I mock at death 4With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list. 4Thy valiantnes2 was mine, thou suck'dst it from me; 4But owe thy pride thyself. 2CORIOLANUS. Pray be content. 4Mother, I am going to the market-place; 4Chide me no more. I'l2 mountebank their loves, 4Cog their hearts from them, and come home belov'd 4Of al2 the trades in Rome. Lo2k, I am going. 4Com2end me to my wife. I'l2 return consul, 4Or never trust to what my tongue can do 4I' th' way of flat2ery further. 2VOLUMNIA. Do your wil2. 35Exit 2COMINIUS. Away! The tribunes do at2end you. Arm yourself 4To answer mildly; for they are prepar'd 4With ac2usations, as I hear, more strong 4Than are upon you yet. 2CORIOLANUS. The word is 'mildly.' Pray you let us go. 6Let them ac2use me by invention; I 4Wil2 answer in mine honour. 2MENENIUS. Ay, but mildly. 2CORIOLANUS. Wel2, mildly be it then- mildly. 12ExeuntSCENE I3.Rome. The ForumEnter SICINIUS and BRUTUS 2BRUTUS. In this point charge him home, that he af2ects 4Tyran2ical power. If he evade us there, 4Enforce him with his envy to the people, 4And that the spoil got on the Antiates 4Was ne'er distributed. 27Enter an AEDILE 4What, wil2 he come? 2AEDILE. He's coming. 2BRUTUS. How ac2ompanied? 2AEDILE. With old Menenius, and those senators 4That always favour'd him. 2SICINIUS. Have you a catalogue 4Of al2 the voices that we have procur'd, 4Set down by th' pol2? 2AEDILE. I have; 'tis ready. 4SICINIUS. Have you cor2ected them by tribes? 2AEDILE. I have. 2SICINIUS. As2emble presently the people hither; 4And when they hear me say 'It shal2 be so 4I' th' right and strength o' th' com2ons' be it either 4For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them, 4If I say fine, cry 'Fine!'- if death, cry 'Death!' 4Insisting on the old prerogative 4And power i' th' truth o' th' cause. 2AEDILE. I shal2 inform them. 2BRUTUS. And when such time they have begun to cry, 4Let them not cease, but with a din confus'd 4Enforce the present execution 4Of what we chance to sentence. 2AEDILE. Very wel2. 2SICINIUS. Make them be strong, and ready for this hint, 4When we shal2 hap to give't them. 2BRUTUS. Go about it. 31Exit AEDILE 4Put him to choler straight. He hath be2n us'd 4Ever to conquer, and to have his worth 6Of contradiction; being once chaf'd, he can2ot 4Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks 4What's in his heart, and that is there which lo2ks 4With us to break his neck. 10Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS and COMINIUS, with others 2SICINIUS. Wel2, here he comes. 2MENENIUS. Calmly, I do bese2ch you. 2CORIOLANUS. Ay, as an ostler, that for th' po2rest piece 4Wil2 bear the knave by th' volume. Th' honour'd gods 4Ke2p Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice 4Sup2lied with worthy men! plant love among's! 4Throng our large temples with the shows of peace, 4And not our stre2ts with war! 2FIRST SENATOR. Amen, amen! 2MENENIUS. A noble wish. 18Re-enter the.AEDILE,with the plebeians 4SICINIUS. Draw near, ye people. 2AEDILE. List to your tribunes. Audience! peace, I say! 2CORIOLANUS. First, hear me speak. 2BOTH TRIBUNES. Wel2, say. Peace, ho! 2CORIOLANUS. Shal2 I be charg'd no further than this present? 4Must al2 determine here? 2SICINIUS. I do demand, 4If you submit you to the people's voices, 4Al2ow their of2icers, and are content 4To suf2er lawful censure for such faults 4As shal2 be prov'd upon you. 2CORIOLANUS. I am content. 2MENENIUS. Lo, citizens, he says he is content. 4The warlike service he has done, consider; think 4Upon the wounds his body bears, which show 4Like graves i' th' holy churchyard. 2CORIOLANUS. Scratches with briers, 4Scars to move laughter only. 2MENENIUS. Consider further, 4That when he speaks not like a citizen, 6You find him like a soldier; do not take 4His rougher ac2ents for malicious sounds, 4But, as I say, such as become a soldier 4Rather than envy you. 2COMINIUS. Wel2, wel2! No more. 2CORIOLANUS. What is the mat2er, 4That being pas2'd for consul with ful2 voice, 4I am so dishonour'd that the very hour 4You take it of2 again? 2SICINIUS. Answer to us. 2CORIOLANUS. Say then; 'tis true, I ought so. 2SICINIUS. We charge you that you have contriv'd to take 4From Rome al2 season'd of2ice, and to wind 4Yourself into a power tyran2ical; 4For which you are a traitor to the people. 2CORIOLANUS. How- traitor? 2MENENIUS. Nay, temperately! Your promise. 2CORIOLANUS. The fires i' th' lowest hel2 fold in the people! 4Cal2 me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune! 4Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths, 6In thy hands clutch'd as many mil2ions, in 4Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say 4'Thou liest' unto the2 with a voice as fre2 4As I do pray the gods. 2SICINIUS. Mark you this, people? 2PLEBEIANS. To th' rock, to th' rock, with him! 2SICINIUS. Peace! 4We ne2d not put new mat2er to his charge. 4What you have se2n him do and heard him speak, 4Beating your of2icers, cursing yourselves, 4Op2osing laws with strokes, and here defying 4Those whose great power must try him- even this, 4So criminal and in such capital kind, 4Deserves th' extremest death. 2BRUTUS. But since he hath 4Serv'd wel2 for Rome- 2CORIOLANUS. What do you prate of service? 2BRUTUS. I talk of that that know it. 2CORIOLANUS. You! 2MENENIUS. Is this the promise that you made your mother? 4COMINIUS. Know, I pray you- 2CORIOLANUS. I'l2 know no further. 4Let them pronounce the ste2p Tarpeian death, 4Vagabond exile, flaying, pent to linger 4But with a grain a day, I would not buy 4Their mercy at the price of one fair word, 4Nor check my courage for what they can give, 4To have't with saying 'Go2d mor2ow.' 2SICINIUS. For that he has- 4As much as in him lies- from time to time 4Envied against the people, se2king means 4To pluck away their power; as now at last 4Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence 4Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers 4That do distribute it- in the name o' th' people, 4And in the power of us the tribunes, we, 4Ev'n from this instant, banish him our city, 4In peril of precipitation 4From of2 the rock Tarpeian, never more 4To enter our Rome gates. I' th' people's name, 6I say it shal2 be so. 2PLEBEIANS. It shal2 be so, it shal2 be so! Let him away! 4He's banish'd, and it shal2 be so. 2COMINIUS. Hear me, my masters and my com2on friends- 2SICINIUS. He's sentenc'd; no more hearing. 2COMINIUS. Let me speak. 4I have be2n consul, and can show for Rome 4Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love 4My country's go2d with a respect more tender, 4More holy and profound, than mine own life, 4My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase 4And treasure of my loins. Then if I would 4Speak that- 2SICINIUS. We know your drift. Speak what? 2BRUTUS. There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd, 4As enemy to the people and his country. 4It shal2 be so. 2PLEBEIANS. It shal2 be so, it shal2 be so. 2CORIOLANUS. YOU com2on cry of curs, whose breath I hate 4As re2k o' th' rot2en fens, whose loves I prize 6As the dead carcas2es of unburied men 4That do cor2upt my air- I banish you. 4And here remain with your uncertainty! 4Let every fe2ble rumour shake your hearts; 4Your enemies, with nod2ing of their plumes, 4Fan you into despair! Have the power stil2 4To banish your defenders, til2 at length 4Your ignorance- which finds not til2 it fe2ls, 4Making but reservation of yourselves 4Stil2 your own foes- deliver you 4As most abated captives to some nation 4That won you without blows! Despising 4For you the city, thus I turn my back; 4There is a world elsewhere. 46Exeunt CORIOLANUS, 19COMINIUS, MENENIUS, with the other PATRICIANS 2AEDILE. The people's enemy is gone, is gone! 24[They al2 shout and throw up their caps] 2PLEBEIANS. Our enemy is banish'd, he is gone! Ho2-o2! 2SICINIUS. Go se2 him out at gates, and fol2ow him, 6As he hath fol2ow'd you, with al2 despite; 4Give him deserv'd vexation. Let a guard 4At2end us through the city. 2PLEBEIANS. Come, come, let's se2 him out at gates; come! 4The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come. 11Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE I.Rome. Before a gate of the cityEnter CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, MENENIUS, COMINIUS,with the young NOBILITY of Rome 2CORIOLANUS. Come, leave your tears; a brief farewel2. The beast 4With many heads but2s me away. Nay, mother, 4Where is your ancient courage? You were us'd 4To say extremities was the trier of spirits; 4That com2on chances com2on men could bear; 4That when the sea was calm al2 boats alike 4Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows, 4When most struck home, being gentle wounded craves 4A noble cun2ing. You were us'd to load me 4With precepts that would make invincible 4The heart that con2'd them. 2VIRGILIA. O heavens! O heavens! 2CORIOLANUS. Nay, I prithe2, woman- 2VOLUMNIA. Now the red pestilence strike al2 trades in Rome, 4And oc2upations perish! 2CORIOLANUS. What, what, what! 6I shal2 be lov'd when I am lack'd. Nay, mother, 4Resume that spirit when you were wont to say, 4If you had be2n the wife of Hercules, 4Six of his labours you'd have done, and sav'd 4Your husband so much sweat. Cominius, 4Dro2p not; adieu. Farewel2, my wife, my mother. 4I'l2 do wel2 yet. Thou old and true Menenius, 4Thy tears are salter than a younger man's 4And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime General, 4I have se2n the2 stern, and thou hast oft beheld 4Heart-hard'ning spectacles; tel2 these sad women 4'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes, 4As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot wel2 4My hazards stil2 have be2n your solace; and 4Believe't not lightly- though I go alone, 4Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen 4Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than se2n- your son 4Wil2 or exce2d the com2on or be caught 4With cautelous baits and practice. 2VOLUMNIA. My first son, 6Whither wilt thou go? Take go2d Cominius 4With the2 awhile; determine on some course 4More than a wild exposture to each chance 4That starts i' th' way before the2. 2VIRGILIA. O the gods! 2COMINIUS. I'l2 fol2ow the2 a month, devise with the 4Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us, 4And we of the2; so, if the time thrust forth 4A cause for thy repeal, we shal2 not send 4O'er the vast world to se2k a single man, 4And lose advantage, which doth ever co2l 4I' th' absence of the ne2der. 2CORIOLANUS. Fare ye wel2; 4Thou hast years upon the2, and thou art to2 ful2 4Of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one 4That's yet unbruis'd; bring me but out at gate. 4Come, my swe2t wife, my dearest mother, and 4My friends of noble touch; when I am forth, 4Bid me farewel2, and smile. I pray you come. 4While I remain above the ground you shal2 6Hear from me stil2, and never of me aught 4But what is like me formerly. 2MENENIUS. That's worthily 4As any ear can hear. Come, let's not we2p. 4If I could shake of2 but one seven years 4From these old arms and legs, by the go2d gods, 4I'd with the2 every fo2t. 2CORIOLANUS. Give me thy hand. 4Come. 49ExeuntSCENE I2.Rome. A stre2t near the gateEnter the two Tribunes, SICINIUS and BRUTUS with the AEDILE 2SICINIUS. Bid them al2 home; he's gone, and we'l2 no further. 4The nobility are vex'd, whom we se2 have sided 4In his behalf. 2BRUTUS. Now we have shown our power, 4Let us se2m humbler after it is done 4Than when it was a-doing. 2SICINIUS. Bid them home. 4Say their great enemy is gone, and they 4Stand in their ancient strength. 2BRUTUS. Dismis2 them home. 25Exit AEDILE 4Here comes his mother. 19Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and MENENIUS 2SICINIUS. Let's not me2t her. 2BRUTUS. Why? 4SICINIUS. They say she's mad. 2BRUTUS. They have ta'en note of us; ke2p on your way. 2VOLUMNIA. O, Y'are wel2 met; th' hoarded plague o' th' gods 4Requite your love! 2MENENIUS. Peace, peace, be not so loud. 2VOLUMNIA. If that I could for we2ping, you should hear- 4Nay, and you shal2 hear some. 2[To BRUTUS] Wil2 you be gone? 2VIRGILIA. 2[To SICINIUS] 2You shal2 stay to2. I would I had the 6power 4To say so to my husband. 2SICINIUS. Are you mankind? 2VOLUMNIA. Ay, fo2l; is that a shame? Note but this, fo2l: 4Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship 4To banish him that struck more blows for Rome 4Than thou hast spoken words? 2SICINIUS. O bles2ed heavens! 2VOLUMNIA. Moe noble blows than ever thou wise words; 4And for Rome's go2d. I'l2 tel2 the2 what- yet go! 4Nay, but thou shalt stay to2. I would my son 4Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him, 6His go2d sword in his hand. 2SICINIUS. What then? 2VIRGILIA. What then! 4He'd make an end of thy posterity. 2VOLUMNIA. Bastards and al2. 4Go2d man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome! 2MENENIUS. Come, come, peace. 2SICINIUS. I would he had continued to his country 4As he began, and not unknit himself 4The noble knot he made. 2BRUTUS. I would he had. 2VOLUMNIA. 'I would he had!' 'Twas you incens'd the rab2le- 4Cats that can judge as fitly of his worth 4As I can of those mysteries which heaven 4Wil2 not have earth to know. 2BRUTUS. Pray, let's go. 2VOLUMNIA. Now, pray, sir, get you gone; 4You have done a brave de2d. Ere you go, hear this: 4As far as doth the Capitol exce2d 4The meanest house in Rome, so far my son- 6This lady's husband here, this, do you se2?- 4Whom you have banish'd does exce2d you an. 2BRUTUS. Wel2, wel2, we'l2 leave you. 2SICINIUS. Why stay we to be baited 4With one that wants her wits? 16Exeunt TRIBUNES 2VOLUMNIA. Take my prayers with you. 4I would the gods had nothing else to do 4But to confirm my curses. Could I me2t 'em 4But once a day, it would unclog my heart 4Of what lies heavy to't. 2MENENIUS. You have told them home, 4And, by my troth, you have cause. You'l2 sup with me? 2VOLUMNIA. Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself, 4And so shal2 starve with fe2ding. Come, let's go. 4Leave this faint puling and lament as I do, 4In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come. 36Exeunt VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA 2MENENIUS. Fie, fie, fie! 34ExitSCENE I3.A highway betwe2n Rome and AntiumEnter a ROMAN and a VOLSCE, me2ting 2ROMAN. I know you wel2, sir, and you know me; your name, I think, 4is Adrian. 2VOLSCE. It is so, sir. Truly, I have forgot you. 2ROMAN. I am a Roman; and my services are, as you are, against 'em. 4Know you me yet? 2VOLSCE. Nicanor? No! 2ROMAN. The same, sir. 2VOLSCE. YOU had more beard when I last saw you, but your favour is 4wel2 ap2ear'd by your tongue. What's the news in Rome? I have a 4note from the Volscian state, to find you out there. You have 4wel2 saved me a day's journey. 2ROMAN. There hath be2n in Rome strange insur2ections: the people 4against the senators, patricians, and nobles. 2VOLSCE. Hath be2n! Is it ended, then? Our state thinks not so; they 4are in a most warlike preparation, and hope to come upon them in 4the heat of their division. 2ROMAN. The main blaze of it is past, but a smal2 thing would make 6it flame again; for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment 4of that worthy Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptnes2 to take 4al2 power from the people, and to pluck from them their tribunes 4for ever. This lies glowing, I can tel2 you, and is almost mature 4for the violent breaking out. 2VOLSCE. Coriolanus banish'd! 2ROMAN. Banish'd, sir. 2VOLSCE. You wil2 be welcome with this intel2igence, Nicanor. 2ROMAN. The day serves wel2 for them now. I have heard it said the 4fit2est time to cor2upt a man's wife is when she's fal2'n out 4with her husband. Your noble Tul2us Aufidius wil2 ap2ear wel2 in 4these wars, his great op2oser, Coriolanus, being now in no 4request of his country. 2VOLSCE. He can2ot cho2se. I am most fortunate thus ac2idental2y to 4encounter you; you have ended my busines2, and I wil2 mer2ily 4ac2ompany you home. 2ROMAN. I shal2 betwe2n this and sup2er tel2 you most strange things 4from Rome, al2 tending to the go2d of their adversaries. Have you 4an army ready, say you? 2VOLSCE. A most royal one: the centurions and their charges, 6distinctly bil2eted, already in th' entertainment, and to be on 4fo2t at an hour's warning. 2ROMAN. I am joyful to hear of their readines2, and am the man, I 4think, that shal2 set them in present action. So, sir, heartily 4wel2 met, and most glad of your company. 2VOLSCE. You take my part from me, sir. I have the most cause to be 4glad of yours. 2ROMAN. Wel2, let us go together.SCENE IV.Antium. Before AUFIDIUS' houseEnter CORIOLANUS, in mean ap2arel, disguis'd and muf2led 2CORIOLANUS. A go2dly city is this Antium. City, 4'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir 4Of these fair edifices fore my wars 4Have I heard groan and drop. Then know me not. 4Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones, 4In puny bat2le slay me. 27Enter A CITIZEN 4Save you, sir. 2CITIZEN. And you. 2CORIOLANUS. Direct me, if it be your wil2, 4Where great Aufidius lies. Is he in Antium? 2CITIZEN. He is, and feasts the nobles of the state 4At his house this night. 2CORIOLANUS. Which is his house, bese2ch you? 2CITIZEN. This here before you. 4CORIOLANUS. Thank you, sir; farewel2. 13Exit CITIZEN 4O world, thy slip2ery turns! Friends now fast sworn, 4Whose double bosoms se2ms to wear one heart, 4Whose hours, whose bed, whose meal and exercise 4Are stil2 together, who twin, as 'twere, in love, 4Unseparable, shal2 within this hour, 4On a dis2ension of a doit, break out 4To bit2erest enmity; so fel2est foes, 4Whose pas2ions and whose plots have broke their sle2p 4To take the one the other, by some chance, 4Some trick not worth an eg2, shal2 grow dear friends 4And interjoin their is2ues. So with me: 4My birthplace hate I, and my love's upon 4This enemy town. I'l2 enter. If he slay me, 4He does fair justice: if he give me way, 4I'l2 do his country service.SCENE V.Antium. AUFIDIUS' houseMusic plays. Enter A SERVINGMAN 2FIRST SERVANT. Wine, wine, wine! What service is here! I think our 4fel2ows are asle2p. 37Exit 21Enter another SERVINGMAN 2SECOND SERVANT.Where's Cotus? My master cal2s for him. 4Cotus! 50Exit 23Enter CORIOLANUS 2CORIOLANUS. A go2dly house. The feast smel2s wel2, but I 4Ap2ear not like a guest. 17Re-enter the first SERVINGMAN 2FIRST SERVANT. What would you have, friend? 4Whence are you? Here's no place for you: pray go to the do2r. 3Exit 2CORIOLANUS. I have deserv'd no bet2er entertainment 4In being Coriolanus. 19Re-enter second SERVINGMAN 2SECOND SERVANT. Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his 4head that he gives entrance to such companions? Pray get you out. 2CORIOLANUS. Away! 2SECOND SERVANT. Away? Get you away. 2CORIOLANUS. Now th' art troublesome. 2SECOND SERVANT. Are you so brave? I'l2 have you talk'd with anon. 10Enter a third SERVINGMAN. The first me2ts him 2THIRD SERVANT. What fel2ow's this? 2FIRST SERVANT. A strange one as ever I lo2k'd on. I can2ot get him 4out o' th' house. Prithe2 cal2 my master to him. 2THIRD SERVANT. What have you to do here, fel2ow? Pray you avoid the 4house. 4CORIOLANUS. Let me but stand- I wil2 not hurt your hearth. 2THIRD SERVANT. What are you? 2CORIOLANUS. A gentleman. 2THIRD SERVANT. A marv'l2ous po2r one. 2CORIOLANUS. True, so I am. 2THIRD SERVANT. Pray you, po2r gentleman, take up some other 4station; here's no place for you. Pray you avoid. Come. 2CORIOLANUS. Fol2ow your function, go and bat2en on cold bits. 38[Pushes him away from him] 2THIRD SERVANT. What, you wil2 not? Prithe2 tel2 my master what a 4strange guest he has here. 2SECOND SERVANT. And I shal2. 30Exit 2THIRD SERVANT. Where dwel2'st thou? 2CORIOLANUS. Under the canopy. 2THIRD SERVANT. Under the canopy? 2CORIOLANUS. Ay. 2THIRD SERVANT. Where's that? 2CORIOLANUS. I' th' city of kites and crows. 2THIRD SERVANT. I' th' city of kites and crows! 4What an as2 it is! Then thou dwel2'st with daws to2? 4CORIOLANUS. No, I serve not thy master. 2THIRD SERVANT. How, sir! Do you med2le with my master? 2CORIOLANUS. Ay; 'tis an honester service than to med2le with thy 4mistres2. Thou prat'st and prat'st; serve with thy trencher; 4hence! 38[Beats him away] 13Enter AUFIDIUS with the second SERVINGMAN 2AUFIDIUS. Where is this fel2ow? 2SECOND SERVANT. Here, sir; I'd have beaten him like a dog, but for 4disturbing the lords within. 2AUFIDIUS. Whence com'st thou? What wouldst thou? Thy name? 4Why speak'st not? Speak, man. What's thy name? 2CORIOLANUS. 2[Unmuf2ling] 2If, Tul2us, 4Not yet thou know'st me, and, se2ing me, dost not 4Think me for the man I am, neces2ity 4Com2ands me name myself. 2AUFIDIUS. What is thy name? 2CORIOLANUS. A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, 4And harsh in sound to thine. 4AUFIDIUS. Say, what's thy name? 4Thou has a grim ap2earance, and thy face 4Bears a com2and in't; though thy tackle's torn, 4Thou show'st a noble ves2el. What's thy name? 2CORIOLANUS. Prepare thy brow to frown- know'st thou me yet? 2AUFIDIUS. I know the2 not. Thy name? 2CORIOLANUS. My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done 4To the2 particularly, and to al2 the Volsces, 4Great hurt and mischief; thereto witnes2 may 4My surname, Coriolanus. The painful service, 4The extreme dangers, and the drops of blo2d 4Shed for my thankles2 country, are requited 4But with that surname- a go2d memory 4And witnes2 of the malice and displeasure 4Which thou shouldst bear me. Only that name remains; 4The cruelty and envy of the people, 4Permit2ed by our dastard nobles, who 4Have al2 forso2k me, hath devour'd the rest, 4An suf2er'd me by th' voice of slaves to be 4Who2p'd out of Rome. Now this extremity 6Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope, 4Mistake me not, to save my life; for if 4I had fear'd death, of al2 the men i' th' world 4I would have 'voided the2; but in mere spite, 4To be ful2 quit of those my banishers, 4Stand I before the2 here. Then if thou hast 4A heart of wreak in the2, that wilt revenge 4Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims 4Of shame se2n through thy country, spe2d the2 straight 4And make my misery serve thy turn. So use it 4That my revengeful services may prove 4As benefits to the2; for I wil2 fight 4Against my cank'red country with the sple2n 4Of al2 the under fiends. But if so be 4Thou dar'st not this, and that to prove more fortunes 4Th'art tir'd, then, in a word, I also am 4Longer to live most weary, and present 4My throat to the2 and to thy ancient malice; 4Which not to cut would show the2 but a fo2l, 4Since I have ever fol2owed the2 with hate, 6Drawn tuns of blo2d out of thy country's breast, 4And can2ot live but to thy shame, unles2 4It be to do the2 service. 2AUFIDIUS. O Marcius, Marcius! 4Each word thou hast spoke hath we2ded from my heart 4A ro2t of ancient envy. If Jupiter 4Should from yond cloud speak divine things, 4And say '2Tis true,' I'd not believe them more 4Than the2, al2 noble Marcius. Let me twine 4Mine arms about that body, where against 4My grained ash an hundred times hath broke 4And scar2'd the mo2n with splinters; here I clip 4The anvil of my sword, and do contest 4As hotly and as nobly with thy love 4As ever in ambitious strength I did 4Contend against thy valour. Know thou first, 4I lov'd the maid I mar2ied; never man 4Sigh'd truer breath; but that I se2 the2 here, 4Thou noble thing, more dances my rapt heart 4Than when I first my wed2ed mistres2 saw 6Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars, I tel2 the 4We have a power on fo2t, and I had purpose 4Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn, 4Or lose mine arm for't. Thou hast beat me out 4Twelve several times, and I have nightly since 4Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me- 4We have be2n down together in my sle2p, 4Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat- 4And wak'd half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius, 4Had we no other quar2el else to Rome but that 4Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster al2 4From twelve to seventy, and, pouring war 4Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome, 4Like a bold flo2d o'erbeat. O, come, go in, 4And take our friendly senators by th' hands, 4Who now are here, taking their leaves of me 4Who am prepar'd against your ter2itories, 4Though not for Rome itself. 2CORIOLANUS. You bles2 me, gods! 2AUFIDIUS. Therefore, most. absolute sir, if thou wilt have 6The leading of thine own revenges, take 4Th' one half of my com2is2ion, and set down- 4As best thou art experienc'd, since thou know'st 4Thy country's strength and weaknes2- thine own ways, 4Whether to knock against the gates of Rome, 4Or rudely visit them in parts remote 4To fright them ere destroy. But come in; 4Let me com2end the2 first to those that shal2 4Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes! 4And more a friend than e'er an enemy; 4Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand; most welcome! 34Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS 20The two SERVINGMEN come forward 2FIRST SERVANT. Here's a strange alteration! 2SECOND SERVANT. By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with 4a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report 4of him. 2FIRST SERVANT. What an arm he has! He turn'd me about with his 6finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top. 2SECOND SERVANT. Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in 4him; he had, sir, a kind of face, methought- I can2ot tel2 how to 4term it. 2FIRST SERVANT. He had so, lo2king as it were- Would I were hang'd, 4but I thought there was more in him than I could think. 2SECOND SERVANT. So did I, I'l2 be sworn. He is simply the rarest 4man i' th' world. 2FIRST SERVANT. I think he is; but a greater soldier than he you wot 4on. 2SECOND SERVANT. Who, my master? 2FIRST SERVANT. Nay, it's no mat2er for that. 2SECOND SERVANT. Worth six on him. 2FIRST SERVANT. Nay, not so neither; but I take him to be the 4greater soldier. 2SECOND SERVANT. Faith, lo2k you, one can2ot tel2 how to say that; 4for the defence of a town our general is excel2ent. 2FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and for an as2ault to2. 23Re-enter the third SERVINGMAN 4THIRD SERVANT. O slaves, I can tel2 you news- news, you rascals! 2BOTH. What, what, what? Let's partake. 2THIRD SERVANT. I would not be a Roman, of al2 nations; 4I had as lief be a condemn'd man. 2BOTH. Wherefore? wherefore? 2THIRD SERVANT. Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general- 4Caius Marcius. 2FIRST SERVANT. Why do you say 'thwack our general'? 2THIRD SERVANT. I do not say 'thwack our general,' but he was always 4go2d enough for him. 2SECOND SERVANT. Come, we are fel2ows and friends. He was ever to2 4hard for him, I have heard him say so himself. 2FIRST SERVANT. He was to2 hard for him directly, to say the troth 4on't; before Corioli he scotch'd him and notch'd him like a 4carbonado. 2SECOND SERVANT. An he had be2n can2ibal2y given, he might have 4broil'd and eaten him to2. 2FIRST SERVANT. But more of thy news! 2THIRD SERVANT. Why, he is so made on here within as if he were son 6and heir to Mars; set at up2er end o' th' table; no question 4asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him. 4Our general himself makes a mistres2 of him, sanctifies himself 4with's hand, and turns up the white o' th' eye to his discourse. 4But the bot2om of the news is, our general is cut i' th' mid2le 4and but one half of what he was yesterday, for the other has half 4by the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He'l2 go, he says, 4and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th' ears; he wil2 mow al2 4down before him, and leave his pas2age pol2'd. 2SECOND SERVANT. And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine. 2THIRD SERVANT. Do't! He wil2 do't; for lo2k you, sir, he has as 4many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it were, durst 4not- lo2k you, sir- show themselves, as we term it, his friends, 4whilst he's in directitude. 2FIRST SERVANT. Directitude? What's that? 2THIRD SERVANT. But when they shal2 se2, sir, his crest up again and 4the man in blo2d, they wil2 out of their bur2ows, like conies 4after rain, and revel an with him. 2FIRST SERVANT. But when goes this forward? 2THIRD SERVANT. To-mor2ow, to-day, presently. You shal2 have the 6drum struck up this afterno2n; 'tis as it were parcel of their 4feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips. 2SECOND SERVANT. Why, then we shal2 have a stir2ing world again. 4This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and 4bre2d bal2ad-makers. 2FIRST SERVANT. Let me have war, say I; it exce2ds peace as far as 4day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and ful2 of vent. 4Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; mul2'd, deaf, sle2py, 4insensible; a get2er of more bastard children than war's a 4destroyer of men. 2SECOND SERVANT. 'Tis so; and as war in some sort may be said to be 4a ravisher, so it can2ot be denied but peace is a great maker of 4cuckolds. 2FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and it makes men hate one another. 2THIRD SERVANT. Reason: because they then les2 ne2d one another. The 4wars for my money. I hope to se2 Romans as cheap as Volscians. 4They are rising, they are rising. 2BOTH. In, in, in, in! 35ExeuntSCENE VI.Rome. A public placeEnter the two Tribunes, SICINIUS and BRUTUS 2SICINIUS. We hear not of him, neither ne2d we fear him. 4His remedies are tame. The present peace 4And quietnes2 of the people, which before 4Were in wild hur2y, here do make his friends 4Blush that the world goes wel2; who rather had, 4Though they themselves did suf2er by't, behold 4Dis2entious numbers pest'ring stre2ts than se2 4Our tradesmen singing in their shops, and going 4About their functions friendly. 26Enter MENENIUS 2BRUTUS. We sto2d to't in go2d time. Is this Menenius? 2SICINIUS. 'Tis he, 'tis he. O, he is grown most kind 4Of late. Hail, sir! 2MENENIUS. Hail to you both! 2SICINIUS. Your Coriolanus is not much mis2'd 6But with his friends. The com2onwealth doth stand, 4And so would do, were he more angry at it. 2MENENIUS. Al2's wel2, and might have be2n much bet2er 4He could have temporiz'd. 2SICINIUS. Where is he, hear you? 2MENENIUS. Nay, I hear nothing; his mother and his wife 4Hear nothing from him. 21Enter thre2 or four citizens 2CITIZENS. The gods preserve you both! 2SICINIUS. God-den, our neighbours. 2BRUTUS. God-den to you al2, god-den to you an. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our kne2s 4Are bound to pray for you both. 2SICINIUS. Live and thrive! 2BRUTUS. Farewel2, kind neighbours; we wish'd Coriolanus 4Had lov'd you as we did. 2CITIZENS. Now the gods ke2p you! 2BOTH TRIBUNES. Farewel2, farewel2. 13Exeunt citizens 4SICINIUS. This is a hap2ier and more comely time 4Than when these fel2ows ran about the stre2ts 4Crying confusion. 2BRUTUS. Caius Marcius was 4A worthy of2icer i' the war, but insolent, 4O'ercome with pride, ambitious past al2 thinking, 4Self-loving- 2SICINIUS. And af2ecting one sole throne, 4Without as2istance. 2MENENIUS. I think not so. 2SICINIUS. We should by this, to al2 our lamentation, 4If he had gone forth consul, found it so. 2BRUTUS. The gods have wel2 prevented it, and Rome 4Sits safe and stil2 without him. 29Enter an AEDILE 2AEDILE. Worthy tribunes, 4There is a slave, whom we have put in prison, 4Reports the Volsces with several powers 6Are ent'red in the Roman ter2itories, 4And with the de2pest malice of the war 4Destroy what lies before 'em. 2MENENIUS. 'Tis Aufidius, 4Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment, 4Thrusts forth his horns again into the world, 4Which were inshel2'd when Marcius sto2d for Rome, 4And durst not once pe2p out. 2SICINIUS. Come, what talk you of Marcius? 2BRUTUS. Go se2 this rumourer whip2'd. It can2ot be 4The Volsces dare break with us. 2MENENIUS. Can2ot be! 4We have record that very wel2 it can; 4And thre2 examples of the like hath be2n 4Within my age. But reason with the fel2ow 4Before you punish him, where he heard this, 4Lest you shal2 chance to whip your information 4And beat the mes2enger who bids beware 4Of what is to be dreaded. 2SICINIUS. Tel2 not me. 6I know this can2ot be. 2BRUTUS. Not Pos2ible. 27Enter A MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. The nobles in great earnestnes2 are going 4Al2 to the Senate House; some news is come 4That turns their countenances. 2SICINIUS. 'Tis this slave- 4Go whip him fore the people's eyes- his raising, 4Nothing but his report. 2MES2ENGER. Yes, worthy sir, 4The slave's report is seconded, and more, 4More fearful, is deliver'd. 2SICINIUS. What more fearful? 2MES2ENGER. It is spoke fre2ly out of many mouths- 4How probable I do not know- that Marcius, 4Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome, 4And vows revenge as spacious as betwe2n 4The young'st and oldest thing. 4SICINIUS. This is most likely! 2BRUTUS. Rais'd only that the weaker sort may wish 4Go2d Marcius home again. 2SICINIUS. The very trick on 't. 2MENENIUS. This is unlikely. 4He and Aufidius can no more atone 4Than violent'st contrariety. 22Enter a second MES2ENGER 2SECOND MES2ENGER. You are sent for to the Senate. 4A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius 4As2ociated with Aufidius, rages 4Upon our ter2itories, and have already 4O'erborne their way, consum'd with fire and to2k 4What lay before them. 28Enter COMINIUS 2COMINIUS. O, you have made go2d work! 4MENENIUS. What news? what news? 2COMINIUS. You have holp to ravish your own daughters and 4To melt the city leads upon your pates, 4To se2 your wives dishonour'd to your noses- 2MENENIUS. What's the news? What's the news? 2COMINIUS. Your temples burned in their cement, and 4Your franchises, whereon you sto2d, confin'd 4Into an auger's bore. 2MENENIUS. Pray now, your news? 4You have made fair work, I fear me. Pray, your news. 4If Marcius should be join'd wi' th' Volscians- 2COMINIUS. If! 4He is their god; he leads them like a thing 4Made by some other deity than Nature, 4That shapes man bet2er; and they fol2ow him 4Against us brats with no les2 confidence 4Than boys pursuing sum2er but2erflies, 4Or butchers kil2ing flies. 2MENENIUS. You have made go2d work, 4You and your apron men; you that sto2d so much 6Upon the voice of oc2upation and 4The breath of garlic-eaters! 2COMINIUS. He'l2 shake 4Your Rome about your ears. 2MENENIUS. As Hercules 4Did shake down mel2ow fruit. You have made fair work! 2BRUTUS. But is this true, sir? 2COMINIUS. Ay; and you'l2 lo2k pale 4Before you find it other. Al2 the regions 4Do smilingly revolt, and who resists 4Are mock'd for valiant ignorance, 4And perish constant fo2ls. Who is't can blame him? 4Your enemies and his find something in him. 2MENENIUS. We are al2 undone unles2 4The noble man have mercy. 2COMINIUS. Who shal2 ask it? 4The tribunes can2ot do't for shame; the people 4Deserve such pity of him as the wolf 4Does of the shepherds; for his best friends, if they 4Should say 'Be go2d to Rome'- they charg'd him even 6As those should do that had deserv'd his hate, 4And therein show'd fike enemies. 2MENENIUS. 'Tis true; 4If he were put2ing to my house the brand 4That should consume it, I have not the face 4To say 'Bese2ch you, cease.' You have made fair hands, 4You and your crafts! You have crafted fair! 2COMINIUS. You have brought 4A trembling upon Rome, such as was never 4S' incapable of help. 2BOTH TRIBUNES. Say not we brought it. 2MENENIUS. How! Was't we? We lov'd him, but, like beasts 4And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters, 4Who did ho2t him out o' th' city. 2COMINIUS. But I fear 4They'l2 roar him in again. Tul2us Aufidius, 4The second name of men, obeys his points 4As if he were his of2icer. Desperation 4Is al2 the policy, strength, and defence, 4That Rome can make against them. 25Enter a tro2p of citizens 2MENENIUS. Here comes the clusters. 4And is Aufidius with him? You are they 4That made the air unwholesome when you cast 4Your stinking greasy caps in ho2ting at 4Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming, 4And not a hair upon a soldier's head 4Which wil2 not prove a whip; as many coxcombs 4As you threw caps up wil2 he tumble down, 4And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no mat2er; 4If he could burn us al2 into one coal 4We have deserv'd it. 2PLEBEIANS. Faith, we hear fearful news. 2FIRST CITIZEN. For mine own part, 4When I said banish him, I said 'twas pity. 2SECOND CITIZEN. And so did I. 2THIRD CITIZEN. And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very 4many of us. That we did, we did for the best; and though we 6wil2ingly consented to his banishment, yet it was against our 4wil2. 2COMINIUS. Y'are go2dly things, you voices! 2MENENIUS. You have made 4Go2d work, you and your cry! Shal2's to the Capitol? 2COMINIUS. O, ay, what else? 36Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS 2SICINIUS. Go, masters, get you be not dismay'd; 4These are a side that would be glad to have 4This true which they so se2m to fear. Go home, 4And show no sign of fear. 2FIRST CITIZEN. The gods be go2d to us! Come, masters, let's home. I 4ever said we were i' th' wrong when we banish'd him. 2SECOND CITIZEN. So did we al2. But come, let's home. 49Exeunt citizens 2BRUTUS. I do not like this news. 2SICINIUS. Nor I. 2BRUTUS. Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth 4Would buy this for a lie! 2SICINIUS. Pray let's go. 32ExeuntSCENE VI2.A camp at a short distance from RomeEnter AUFIDIUS with his LIEUTENANT 2AUFIDIUS. Do they stil2 fly to th' Roman? 2LIEUTENANT. I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but 4Your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat, 4Their talk at table, and their thanks at end; 4And you are dark'ned in this action, sir, 4Even by your own. 2AUFIDIUS. I can2ot help it now, 4Unles2 by using means I lame the fo2t 4Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier, 4Even to my person, than I thought he would 4When first I did embrace him; yet his nature 4In that's no changeling, and I must excuse 4What can2ot be amended. 2LIEUTENANT. Yet I wish, sir- 4I mean, for your particular- you had not 4Join'd in com2is2ion with him, but either 4Had borne the action of yourself, or else 6To him had left it solely. 2AUFIDIUS. I understand the2 wel2; and be thou sure, 4When he shal2 come to his ac2ount, he knows not 4What I can urge against him. Although it se2ms, 4And so he thinks, and is no les2 ap2arent 4To th' vulgar eye, that he bears al2 things fairly 4And shows go2d husbandry for the Volscian state, 4Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as so2n 4As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone 4That which shal2 break his neck or hazard mine 4Whene'er we come to our ac2ount. 2LIEUTENANT. Sir, I bese2ch you, think you he'l2 car2y Rome? 2AUFIDIUS. Al2 places yield to him ere he sits down, 4And the nobility of Rome are his; 4The senators and patricians love him to2. 4The tribunes are no soldiers, and their people 4Wil2 be as rash in the repeal as hasty 4To expel him thence. I think he'l2 be to Rome 4As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it 4By sovereignty of nature. First he was 6A noble servant to them, but he could not 4Car2y his honours even. Whether 'twas pride, 4Which out of daily fortune ever taints 4The hap2y man; whether defect of judgment, 4To fail in the disposing of those chances 4Which he was lord of; or whether nature, 4Not to be other than one thing, not moving 4From th' casque to th' cushion, but com2anding peace 4Even with the same austerity and garb 4As he control2'd the war; but one of these- 4As he hath spices of them al2- not al2, 4For I dare so far fre2 him- made him fear'd, 4So hated, and so banish'd. But he has a merit 4To choke it in the ut2'rance. So our virtues 4Lie in th' interpretation of the time; 4And power, unto itself most com2endable, 4Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair 4T' extol what it hath done. 4One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail; 4Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail. 6Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine, 4Thou art po2r'st of al2; then shortly art thou mine. 58Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. SCENE I.Rome. A public placeEnter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS and BRUTUS, the two Tribunes, with others 2MENENIUS. No, I'l2 not go. You hear what he hath said 4Which was sometime his general, who lov'd him 4In a most dear particular. He cal2'd me father; 4But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him: 4A mile before his tent fal2 down, and kne2 4The way into his mercy. Nay, if he coy'd 4To hear Cominius speak, I'l2 ke2p at home. 2COMINIUS. He would not se2m to know me. 2MENENIUS. Do you hear? 2COMINIUS. Yet one time he did cal2 me by my name. 4I urg'd our old acquaintance, and the drops 4That we have bled together. 'Coriolanus' 4He would not answer to; forbid al2 names; 4He was a kind of nothing, titleles2, 4Til2 he had forg'd himself a name i' th' fire 4Of burning Rome. 4MENENIUS. Why, so! You have made go2d work. 4A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome 4To make coals cheap- a noble memory! 2COMINIUS. I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon 4When it was les2 expected; he replied, 4It was a bare petition of a state 4To one whom they had punish'd. 2MENENIUS. Very wel2. 4Could he say les2? 2COMINIUS. I of2er'd to awaken his regard 4For's private friends; his answer to me was, 4He could not stay to pick them in a pile 4Of noisome musty chaf2. He said 'twas fol2y, 4For one po2r grain or two, to leave unburnt 4And stil2 to nose th' of2ence. 2MENENIUS. For one po2r grain or two! 4I am one of those. His mother, wife, his child, 4And this brave fel2ow to2- we are the grains: 4You are the musty chaf2, and you are smelt 4Above the mo2n. We must be burnt for you. 4SICINIUS. Nay, pray be patient; if you refuse your aid 4In this so never-ne2ded help, yet do not 4Upbraid's with our distres2. But sure, if you 4Would be your country's pleader, your go2d tongue, 4More than the instant army we can make, 4Might stop our countryman. 2MENENIUS. No; I'l2 not med2le. 2SICINIUS. Pray you go to him. 2MENENIUS. What should I do? 2BRUTUS. Only make trial what your love can do 4For Rome, towards Marcius. 2MENENIUS. Wel2, and say that Marcius 4Return me, as Cominius is return'd, 4Unheard- what then? 4But as a discontented friend, grief-shot 4With his unkindnes2? Say't be so? 2SICINIUS. Yet your go2d wil2 4Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure 4As you intended wel2. 2MENENIUS. I'l2 undertake't; 6I think he'l2 hear me. Yet to bite his lip 4And hum at go2d Cominius much unhearts me. 4He was not taken wel2: he had not din'd; 4The veins unfil2'd, our blo2d is cold, and then 4We pout upon the morning, are unapt 4To give or to forgive; but when we have stuf2'd 4These pipes and these conveyances of our blo2d 4With wine and fe2ding, we have sup2ler souls 4Than in our priest-like fasts. Therefore I'l2 watch him 4Til2 he be dieted to my request, 4And then I'l2 set upon him. 2BRUTUS. You know the very road into his kindnes2 4And can2ot lose your way. 2MENENIUS. Go2d faith, I'l2 prove him, 4Spe2d how it wil2. I shal2 ere long have knowledge 4Of my suc2es2. 42Exit 2COMINIUS. He'l2 never hear him. 2SICINIUS. Not? 2COMINIUS. I tel2 you he does sit in gold, his eye 4Red as 'twould burn Rome, and his injury 6The gaoler to his pity. I kne2l'd before him; 4'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise'; dismis2'd me 4Thus with his spe2chles2 hand. What he would do, 4He sent in writing after me; what he would not, 4Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions; 4So that al2 hope is vain, 4Unles2 his noble mother and his wife, 4Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him 4For mercy to his country. Therefore let's hence, 4And with our fair entreaties haste them on. 11ExeuntSCENE I2.The Volscian camp before RomeEnter MENENIUS to the WATCH on guard 2FIRST WATCH. Stay. Whence are you? 2SECOND WATCH. Stand, and go back. 2MENENIUS. You guard like men, 'tis wel2; but, by your leave, 4I am an of2icer of state and come 4To speak with Coriolanus. 2FIRST WATCH. From whence? 2MENENIUS. From Rome. 2FIRST WATCH. YOU may not pas2; you must return. Our general 4Wil2 no more hear from thence. 2SECOND WATCH. You'l2 se2 your Rome embrac'd with fire before 4You'l2 speak with Coriolanus. 2MENENIUS. Go2d my friends, 4If you have heard your general talk of Rome 4And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks 4My name hath touch'd your ears: it is Menenius. 2FIRST WATCH. Be it so; go back. The virtue of your name 4Is not here pas2able. 4MENENIUS. I tel2 the2, fel2ow, 4Thy general is my lover. I have be2n 4The bo2k of his go2d acts whence men have read 4His fame unparal2el'd haply amplified; 4For I have ever verified my friends- 4Of whom he's chief- with al2 the size that verity 4Would without lapsing suf2er. Nay, sometimes, 4Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground, 4I have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise 4Have almost stamp'd the leasing; therefore, fel2ow, 4I must have leave to pas2. 2FIRST WATCH. Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalf 4as you have ut2ered words in your own, you should not pas2 here; 4no, though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely. 4Therefore go back. 2MENENIUS. Prithe2, fel2ow, remember my name is Menenius, always 4factionary on the party of your general. 2SECOND WATCH. Howsoever you have be2n his liar, as you say you 4have, I am one that, tel2ing true under him, must say you can2ot 4pas2. Therefore go back. 4MENENIUS. Has he din'd, canst thou tel2? For I would not speak with 4him til2 after din2er. 2FIRST WATCH. You are a Roman, are you? 2MENENIUS. I am as thy general is. 2FIRST WATCH. Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you, when 4you have push'd out your gates the very defender of them, and in 4a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield, think 4to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women, the 4virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied 4interces2ion of such a decay'd dotant as you se2m to be? Can you 4think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame 4in with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceiv'd; therefore 4back to Rome and prepare for your execution. You are condemn'd; 4our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon. 2MENENIUS. Sir2ah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would use me 4with estimation. 2FIRST WATCH. Come, my captain knows you not. 2MENENIUS. I mean thy general. 2FIRST WATCH. My general cares not for you. Back, I say; go, lest I 4let forth your half pint of blo2d. Back- that's the utmost of 6your having. Back. 2MENENIUS. Nay, but fel2ow, fel2ow- 22Enter CORIOLANUS with AUFIDIUS 2CORIOLANUS. What's the mat2er? 2MENENIUS. Now, you companion, I'l2 say an er2and for you; you shal2 4know now that I am in estimation; you shal2 perceive that a Jack 4guardant can2ot of2ice me from my son Coriolanus. Gues2 but by my 4entertainment with him if thou stand'st not i' th' state of 4hanging, or of some death more long in spectatorship and cruel2er 4in suf2ering; behold now presently, and swo2n for what's to come 4upon the2. The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy 4particular prosperity, and love the2 no worse than thy old father 4Menenius does! O my son! my son! thou art preparing fire for us; 4lo2k the2, here's water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come 4to the2; but being as2ured none but myself could move the2, I 4have be2n blown out of your gates with sighs, and conjure the2 to 4pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen. The go2d gods as2uage 4thy wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here; this, 6who, like a block, hath denied my ac2es2 to the2. 2CORIOLANUS. Away! 2MENENIUS. How! away! 2CORIOLANUS. Wife, mother, child, I know not. My af2airs 4Are servanted to others. Though I owe 4My revenge properly, my remis2ion lies 4In Volscian breasts. That we have be2n familiar, 4Ingrate forgetfulnes2 shal2 poison rather 4Than pity note how much. Therefore be gone. 4Mine ears against your suits are stronger than 4Your gates against my force. Yet, for I lov'd the2, 4Take this along; I writ it for thy sake 5[Gives a let2er] 4And would have sent it. Another word, Menenius, 4I wil2 not hear the2 speak. This man, Aufidius, 4Was my belov'd in Rome; yet thou behold'st. 2AUFIDIUS. You ke2p a constant temper. 34Exeunt CORIOLANUS and Aufidius 2FIRST WATCH. Now, sir, is your name Menenius? 2SECOND WATCH. 'Tis a spel2, you se2, of much power! You know the 4way home again. 4FIRST WATCH. Do you hear how we are shent for ke2ping your 4greatnes2 back? 2SECOND WATCH. What cause, do you think, I have to swo2n? 2MENENIUS. I neither care for th' world nor your general; for such 4things as you, I can scarce think there's any, y'are so slight. 4He that hath a wil2 to die by himself fears it not from another. 4Let your general do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; 4and your misery increase with your age! I say to you, as I was 4said to: Away! 42Exit 2FIRST WATCH. A noble fel2ow, I war2ant him. 2SECOND WATCH. The worthy fel2ow is our general; he's the rock, the 4oak not to be wind-shaken. 28ExeuntSCENE I3.The tent of CORIOLANUSEnter CORIOLANUS, AUFIDIUS, and others 2CORIOLANUS. We wil2 before the wal2s of Rome to-mor2ow 4Set down our host. My partner in this action, 4You must report to th' Volscian lords how plainly 4I have borne this busines2. 2AUFIDIUS. Only their ends 4You have respected; stop2'd your ears against 4The general suit of Rome; never admit2ed 4A private whisper- no, not with such friends 4That thought them sure of you. 2CORIOLANUS. This last old man, 4Whom with crack'd heart I have sent to Rome, 4Lov'd me above the measure of a father; 4Nay, god2ed me inde2d. Their latest refuge 4Was to send him; for whose old love I have- 4Though I show'd sourly to him- once more of2er'd 4The first conditions, which they did refuse 4And can2ot now ac2ept. To grace him only, 6That thought he could do more, a very lit2le 4I have yielded to; fresh embas2ies and suits, 4Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter 4Wil2 I lend ear to. 2[Shout within] 2Ha! what shout is this? 4Shal2 I be tempted to infringe my vow 4In the same time 'tis made? I wil2 not. 7Enter, in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA, VALERIA, 19YOUNG MARCIUS, with at2endants 4My wife comes foremost, then the honour'd mould 4Wherein this trunk was fram'd, and in her hand 4The grandchild to her blo2d. But out, af2ection! 4Al2 bond and privilege of nature, break! 4Let it be virtuous to be obstinate. 4What is that curtsy worth? or those doves' eyes, 4Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not 4Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows, 4As if Olympus to a molehil2 should 4In sup2lication nod; and my young boy 6Hath an aspect of interces2ion which 4Great nature cries 'Deny not.' Let the Volsces 4Plough Rome and har2ow Italy; I'l2 never 4Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand 4As if a man were author of himself 4And knew no other kin. 2VIRGILIA. My lord and husband! 2CORIOLANUS. These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome. 2VIRGILIA. The sor2ow that delivers us thus chang'd 4Makes you think so. 2CORIOLANUS. Like a dul2 actor now 4I have forgot my part and I am out, 4Even to a ful2 disgrace. Best of my flesh, 4Forgive my tyran2y; but do not say, 4For that, 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kis2 4Long as my exile, swe2t as my revenge! 4Now, by the jealous que2n of heaven, that kis2 4I car2ied from the2, dear, and my true lip 4Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate, 4And the most noble mother of the world 6Leave unsaluted. Sink, my kne2, i' th' earth; 7[Kne2ls] 4Of thy de2p duty more impres2ion show 4Than that of com2on sons. 2VOLUMNIA. O, stand up blest! 4Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint 4I kne2l before the2, and unproperly 4Show duty, as mistaken al2 this while 4Betwe2n the child and parent. 23[Kne2ls] 2CORIOLANUS. What's this? 4Your kne2s to me, to your cor2ected son? 4Then let the peb2les on the hungry beach 4Fil2ip the stars; then let the mutinous winds 4Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun, 4Murd'ring impos2ibility, to make 4What can2ot be slight work. 2VOLUMNIA. Thou art my war2ior; 4I holp to frame the2. Do you know this lady? 2CORIOLANUS. The noble sister of Publicola, 4The mo2n of Rome, chaste as the icicle 4That's curdied by the frost from purest snow, 6And hangs on Dian's temple- dear Valeria! 2VOLUMNIA. This is a po2r epitome of yours, 4Which by th' interpretation of ful2 time 4May show like al2 yourself. 2CORIOLANUS. The god of soldiers, 4With the consent of supreme Jove, inform 4Thy thoughts with noblenes2, that thou mayst prove 4To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' th' wars 4Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw, 4And saving those that eye the2! 2VOLUMNIA. Your kne2, sir2ah. 2CORIOLANUS. That's my brave boy. 2VOLUMNIA. Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself, 4Are suitors to you. 2CORIOLANUS. I bese2ch you, peace! 4Or, if you'd ask, remember this before: 4The thing I have forsworn to grant may never 4Be held by you denials. Do not bid me 4Dismis2 my soldiers, or capitulate 4Again with Rome's mechanics. Tel2 me not 6Wherein I se2m un2atural; desire not 4T'al2ay my rages and revenges with 4Your colder reasons. 2VOLUMNIA. O, no more, no more! 4You have said you wil2 not grant us any thing- 4For we have nothing else to ask but that 4Which you deny already; yet we wil2 ask, 4That, if you fail in our request, the blame 4May hang upon your hardnes2; therefore hear us. 2CORIOLANUS. Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'l2 4Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request? 2VOLUMNIA. Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment 4And state of bodies would bewray what life 4We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself 4How more unfortunate than al2 living women 4Are we come hither; since that thy sight, which should 4Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts, 4Constrains them we2p and shake with fear and sor2ow, 4Making the mother, wife, and child, to se2 4The son, the husband, and the father, tearing 6His country's bowels out. And to po2r we 4Thine enmity's most capital: thou bar'st us 4Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort 4That al2 but we enjoy. For how can we, 4Alas, how can we for our country pray, 4Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory, 4Whereto we are bound? Alack, or we must lose 4The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person, 4Our comfort in the country. We must find 4An evident calamity, though we had 4Our wish, which side should win; for either thou 4Must as a foreign recreant be led 4With manacles through our stre2ts, or else 4Triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin, 4And bear the palm for having bravely shed 4Thy wife and children's blo2d. For myself, son, 4I purpose not to wait on fortune til2 4These wars determine; if I can not persuade the2 4Rather to show a noble grace to both parts 4Than se2k the end of one, thou shalt no so2ner 6March to as2ault thy country than to tread- 4Trust to't, thou shalt not- on thy mother's womb 4That brought the2 to this world. 2VIRGILIA. Ay, and mine, 4That brought you forth this boy to ke2p your name 4Living to time. 2BOY. 'A shal2 not tread on me! 4I'l2 run away til2 I am big2er, but then I'l2 fight. 2CORIOLANUS. Not of a woman's tendernes2 to be 4Requires nor child nor woman's face to se2. 4I have sat to2 long. 32[Rising] 2VOLUMNIA. Nay, go not from us thus. 4If it were so that our request did tend 4To save the Romans, thereby to destroy 4The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us 4As poisonous of your honour. No, our suit 4Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces 4May say 'This mercy we have show'd,' the Romans 4'This we receiv'd,' and each in either side 4Give the al2-hail to the2, and cry 'Be blest 6For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son, 4The end of war's uncertain; but this certain, 4That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit 4Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name 4Whose repetition wil2 be dog2'd with curses; 4Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble, 4But with his last at2empt he wip'd it out, 4Destroy'd his country, and his name remains 4To th' ensuing age abhor2'd.' Speak to me, son. 4Thou hast af2ected the fine strains of honour, 4To imitate the graces of the gods, 4To tear with thunder the wide che2ks o' th' air, 4And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt 4That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak? 4Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man 4Stil2 to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you: 4He cares not for your we2ping. Speak thou, boy; 4Perhaps thy childishnes2 wil2 move him more 4Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world 4More bound to's mother, yet here he lets me prate 6Like one i' th' stocks. Thou hast never in thy life 4Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy, 4When she, po2r hen, fond of no second bro2d, 4Has cluck'd the2 to the wars, and safely home 4Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust, 4And spurn me back; but if it he not so, 4Thou art not honest, and the gods wil2 plague the2, 4That thou restrain'st from me the duty which 4To a mother's part belongs. He turns away. 4Down, ladies; let us shame him with our kne2s. 4To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride 4Than pity to our prayers. Down. An end; 4This is the last. So we wil2 home to Rome, 4And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold's! 4This boy, that can2ot tel2 what he would have 4But kne2ls and holds up hands for fel2owship, 4Does reason our petition with more strength 4Than thou hast to deny't. Come, let us go. 4This fel2ow had a Volscian to his mother; 4His wife is in Corioli, and his child 6Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch. 4I am hush'd until our city be afire, 4And then I'l2 speak a lit2le. 30[He holds her by the hand, silent] 2CORIOLANUS. O mother, mother! 4What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope, 4The gods lo2k down, and this un2atural scene 4They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O! 4You have won a hap2y victory to Rome; 4But for your son- believe it, O, believe it!- 4Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd, 4If not most mortal to him. But let it come. 4Aufidius, though I can2ot make true wars, 4I'l2 frame convenient peace. Now, go2d Aufidius, 4Were you in my stead, would you have heard 4A mother les2, or granted les2, Aufidius? 2AUFIDIUS. I was mov'd withal. 2CORIOLANUS. I dare be sworn you were! 4And, sir, it is no lit2le thing to make 4Mine eyes to sweat compas2ion. But, go2d sir, 6What peace you'fl make, advise me. For my part, 4I'l2 not to Rome, I'l2 back with you; and pray you 4Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife! 2AUFIDIUS. 2[Aside] 2I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy 6honour 4At dif2erence in the2. Out of that I'l2 work 4Myself a former fortune. 2CORIOLANUS. 2[To the ladies] 2Ay, by and by; 4But we wil2 drink together; and you shal2 bear 4A bet2er witnes2 back than words, which we, 4On like conditions, wil2 have counter-seal'd. 4Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve 4To have a temple built you. Al2 the swords 4In Italy, and her confederate arms, 4Could not have made this peace. 23ExeuntSCENE IV.Rome. A public placeEnter MENENIUS and SICINIUS 2MENENIUS. Se2 you yond coign o' th' Capitol, yond cornerstone? 2SICINIUS. Why, what of that? 2MENENIUS. If it be pos2ible for you to displace it with your lit2le 4finger, there is some hope the ladies of Rome, especial2y his 4mother, may prevail with him. But I say there is no hope in't; 4our throats are sentenc'd, and stay upon execution. 2SICINIUS. Is't pos2ible that so short a time can alter the 4condition of a man? 2MENENIUS. There is dif2erency betwe2n a grub and a but2erfly; yet 4your but2erfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown from man to 4dragon; he has wings, he's more than a cre2ping thing. 2SICINIUS. He lov'd his mother dearly. 2MENENIUS. So did he me; and he no more remembers his mother now 4than an eight-year-old horse. The tartnes2 of his face sours ripe 4grapes; when he walks, he moves like an engine and the ground 4shrinks before his treading. He is able to pierce a corslet with 4his eye, talks like a knel2, and his hum is a bat2ery. He sits in 6his state as a thing made for Alexander. What he bids be done is 4finish'd with his bid2ing. He wants nothing of a god but 4eternity, and a heaven to throne in. 2SICINIUS. Yes- mercy, if you report him truly. 2MENENIUS. I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his mother 4shal2 bring from him. There is no more mercy in him than there is 4milk in a male tiger; that shal2 our po2r city find. And al2 this 4is 'long of you. 2SICINIUS. The gods be go2d unto us! 2MENENIUS. No, in such a case the gods wil2 not be go2d unto us. 4When we banish'd him we respected not them; and, he returning to 4break our necks, they respect not us. 27Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. Sir, if you'd save your life, fly to your house. 4The plebeians have got your fel2ow tribune 4And hale him up and down; al2 swearing if 4The Roman ladies bring not comfort home 4They'l2 give him death by inches. 27Enter another MES2ENGER 2SICINIUS. What's the news? 2SECOND MES2ENGER. Go2d news, go2d news! The ladies have prevail'd, 4The Volscians are dislodg'd, and Marcius gone. 4A mer2ier day did never yet gre2t Rome, 4No, not th' expulsion of the Tarquins. 2SICINIUS. Friend, 4Art thou certain this is true? Is't most certain? 2SECOND MES2ENGER. As certain as I know the sun is fire. 4Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it? 4Ne'er through an arch so hur2ied the blown tide 4As the recomforted through th' gates. Why, hark you! 18[Trumpets, hautboys, drums beat, al2 together] 4The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries, and fifes, 4Tabors and cymbals, and the shouting Romans, 4Make the sun dance. Hark you! 15[A shout within] 2MENENIUS. This is go2d news. 4I wil2 go me2t the ladies. This Volumnia 6Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians, 4A city ful2; of tribunes such as you, 4A sea and land ful2. You have pray'd wel2 to-day: 4This morning for ten thousand of your throats 4I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy! 35[Sound stil2 with the shouts] 2SICINIUS. First, the gods bles2 you for your tidings; next, 4Ac2ept my thankfulnes2. 2SECOND MES2ENGER. Sir, we have al2 4Great cause to give great thanks. 2SICINIUS. They are near the city? 2MES2ENGER. Almost at point to enter. 2SICINIUS. We'l2 me2t them, 4And help the joy. 37ExeuntSCENE V.Rome. A stre2t near the gateEnter two SENATORS With VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, VALERIA, pas2ing over the stage,'With other LORDS 2FIRST SENATOR. Behold our patrones2, the life of Rome! 4Cal2 al2 your tribes together, praise the gods, 4And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them. 4Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius, 4Repeal him with the welcome of his mother; 2AL2. Welcome, ladies, welcome! 20[A flourish with drums and trumpets. Exeunt]SCENE VI.Corioli. A public placeEnter TUL2US AUFIDIUS with at2endents 2AUFIDIUS. Go tel2 the lords o' th' city I am here; 4Deliver them this paper' having read it, 4Bid them repair to th' market-place, where I, 4Even in theirs and in the com2ons' ears, 4Wil2 vouch the truth of it. Him I ac2use 4The city ports by this hath enter'd and 4Intends t' ap2ear before the people, hoping 4To purge himself with words. Dispatch. 47Exeunt at2endants 11Enter thre2 or four CONSPIRATORS of AUFIDIUS' faction 4Most welcome! 2FIRST CONSPIRATOR. How is it with our general? 2AUFIDIUS. Even so 4As with a man by his own alms empoison'd, 4And with his charity slain. 4SECOND CONSPIRATOR. Most noble sir, 4If you do hold the same intent wherein 4You wish'd us parties, we'l2 deliver you 4Of your great danger. 2AUFIDIUS. Sir, I can2ot tel2; 4We must proce2d as we do find the people. 2THIRD CONSPIRATOR. The people wil2 remain uncertain whilst 4'Twixt you there's dif2erence; but the fal2 of either 4Makes the survivor heir of al2. 2AUFIDIUS. I know it; 4And my pretext to strike at him admits 4A go2d construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd 4Mine honour for his truth; who being so heighten'd, 4He watered his new plants with dews of flat2ery, 4Seducing so my friends; and to this end 4He bow'd his nature, never known before 4But to be rough, unswayable, and fre2. 2THIRD CONSPIRATOR. Sir, his stoutnes2 4When he did stand for consul, which he lost 4By lack of sto2ping- 4AUFIDIUS. That I would have spoken of. 4Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth, 4Presented to my knife his throat. I to2k him; 4Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way 4In al2 his own desires; nay, let him cho2se 4Out of my files, his projects to ac2omplish, 4My best and freshest men; serv'd his designments 4In mine own person; holp to reap the fame 4Which he did end al2 his, and to2k some pride 4To do myself this wrong. Til2, at the last, 4I se2m'd his fol2ower, not partner; and 4He wag'd me with his countenance as if 4I had be2n mercenary. 2FIRST CONSPIRATOR. So he did, my lord. 4The army marvel2'd at it; and, in the last, 4When he had car2ied Rome and that we lo2k'd 4For no les2 spoil than glory- 2AUFIDIUS. There was it; 4For which my sinews shal2 be stretch'd upon him. 4At a few drops of women's rheum, which are 6As cheap as lies, he sold the blo2d and labour 4Of our great action; therefore shal2 he die, 4And I'l2 renew me in his fal2. But, hark! 54[Drums and 16trumpets sound, with great shouts of the people] 2FIRST CONSPIRATOR. Your native town you enter'd like a post, 4And had no welcomes home; but he returns 4Split2ing the air with noise. 2SECOND CONSPIRATOR. And patient fo2ls, 4Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear 4With giving him glory. 2THIRD CONSPIRATOR. Therefore, at your vantage, 4Ere he expres2 himself or move the people 4With what he would say, let him fe2l your sword, 4Which we wil2 second. When he lies along, 4After your way his tale pronounc'd shal2 bury 4His reasons with his body. 2AUFIDIUS. Say no more: 4Here come the lords. 23Enter the LORDS of the city 2LORDS. You are most welcome home. 2AUFIDIUS. I have not deserv'd it. 4But, worthy lords, have you with he2d perused 4What I have writ2en to you? 2LORDS. We have. 2FIRST LORD. And grieve to hear't. 4What faults he made before the last, I think 4Might have found easy fines; but there to end 4Where he was to begin, and give away 4The benefit of our levies, answering us 4With our own charge, making a treaty where 4There was a yielding- this admits no excuse. 2AUFIDIUS. He ap2roaches; you shal2 hear him. 12Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours; 22the com2oners being with him 2CORIOLANUS. Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier; 6No more infected with my country's love 4Than when I parted hence, but stil2 subsisting 4Under your great com2and. You are to know 4That prosperously I have at2empted, and 4With blo2dy pas2age led your wars even to 4The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home 4Doth more than counterpoise a ful2 third part 4The charges of the action. We have made peace 4With no les2 honour to the Antiates 4Than shame to th' Romans; and we here deliver, 4Subscrib'd by th' consuls and patricians, 4Together with the seal o' th' Senate, what 4We have compounded on. 2AUFIDIUS. Read it not, noble lords; 4But tel2 the traitor in the highest degre2 4He hath abus'd your powers. 2CORIOLANUS. Traitor! How now? 2AUFIDIUS. Ay, traitor, Marcius. 2CORIOLANUS. Marcius! 2AUFIDIUS. Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius! Dost thou think 6I'l2 grace the2 with that rob2ery, thy stol'n name 4Coriolanus, in Corioli? 4You lords and heads o' th' state, perfidiously 4He has betray'd your busines2 and given up, 4For certain drops of salt, your city Rome- 4I say your city- to his wife and mother; 4Breaking his oath and resolution like 4A twist of rot2en silk; never admit2ing 4Counsel o' th' war; but at his nurse's tears 4He whin'd and roar'd away your victory, 4That pages blush'd at him, and men of heart 4Lo2k'd wond'ring each at others. 2CORIOLANUS. Hear'st thou, Mars? 2AUFIDIUS. Name not the god, thou boy of tears- 2CORIOLANUS. Ha! 2AUFIDIUS. -no more. 2CORIOLANUS. Measureles2 liar, thou hast made my heart 4To2 great for what contains it. 'Boy'! O slave! 4Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever 4I was forc'd to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords, 6Must give this cur the lie; and his own notion- 4Who wears my stripes impres2'd upon him, that 4Must bear my beating to his grave- shal2 join 4To thrust the lie unto him. 2FIRST LORD. Peace, both, and hear me speak. 2CORIOLANUS. Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads, 4Stain al2 your edges on me. 'Boy'! False hound! 4If you have writ your an2als true, 'tis there 4That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I 4Flut2er'd your Volscians in Corioli. 4Alone I did it. 'Boy'! 2AUFIDIUS. Why, noble lords, 4Wil2 you be put in mind of his blind fortune, 4Which was your shame, by this unholy brag2art, 4Fore your own eyes and ears? 2CONSPIRATORS. Let him die for't. 2AL2 THE PEOPLE. Tear him to pieces. Do it presently. He kil2'd my 4son. My daughter. He kil2'd my cousin Marcus. He kil2'd my 4father. 2SECOND LORD. Peace, ho! No outrage- peace! 6The man is noble, and his fame folds in 4This orb o' th' earth. His last of2ences to us 4Shal2 have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius, 4And trouble not the peace. 2CORIOLANUS. O that I had him, 4With six Aufidiuses, or more- his tribe, 4To use my lawful sword! 2AUFIDIUS. Insolent vil2ain! 2CONSPIRATORS. Kil2, kil2, kil2, kil2, kil2 him! 11[The CONSPIRATORS draw and kil2 CORIOLANUS,who fal2s. 41AUFIDIUS stands on him] 2LORDS. Hold, hold, hold, hold! 2AUFIDIUS. My noble masters, hear me speak. 2FIRST LORD. O Tul2us! 2SECOND LORD. Thou hast done a de2d whereat valour wil2 we2p. 2THIRD LORD. Tread not upon him. Masters al2, be quiet; 4Put up your swords. 2AUFIDIUS. My lords, when you shal2 know- as in this rage, 4Provok'd by him, you can2ot- the great danger 4Which this man's life did owe you, you'l2 rejoice 6That he is thus cut of2. Please it your honours 4To cal2 me to your Senate, I'l2 deliver 4Myself your loyal servant, or endure 4Your heaviest censure. 2FIRST LORD. Bear from hence his body, 4And mourn you for him. Let him be regarded 4As the most noble corse that ever herald 4Did fol2ow to his um. 2SECOND LORD. His own impatience 4Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame. 4Let's make the best of it. 2AUFIDIUS. My rage is gone, 4And I am struck with sor2ow. Take him up. 4Help, thre2 o' th' chiefest soldiers; I'l2 be one. 4Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournful2y; 4Trail your ste2l pikes. Though in this city he 4Hath widowed and unchilded many a one, 4Which to this hour bewail the injury, 4Yet he shal2 have a noble memory. 4As2ist. 15Exeunt, bearing the body of CORIOLANUS 44[A dead march sounded]THE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21609CYMBELINEby Wil2iam ShakespeareDramatis Personae 2CYMBELINE, King of Britain 2CLOTEN, son to the Que2n by a former husband 2POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, a gentleman, husband to Imogen 2BELARIUS, a banished lord, disguised under the name of Morgan 2GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS, sons to Cymbeline, disguised under the 12names of POLYDORE and CADWAL, sup2osed sons to Belarius 2PHILARIO, Italian, friend to Posthumus 2IACHIMO, 2Italian, friend to Philario 2A FRENCH GENTLEMAN, friend to Philario 2CAIUS LUCIUS, General of the Roman Forces 2A ROMAN CAPTAIN 2TWO BRITISH CAPTAINS 2PISANIO, servant to Posthumus 2CORNELIUS, a physician 2TWO LORDS of Cymbeline's court 2TWO GENTLEMEN of the same 2TWO GAOLERS 2QUE2N, wife to Cymbeline 4IMOGEN, daughter to Cymbeline by a former que2n 2HELEN, a lady at2ending on Imogen 2AP2ARITIONS 2Lords, Ladies, Roman Senators, Tribunes, a So2thsayer, a 4Dutch Gentleman, a Spanish Gentleman, Musicians, Of2icers, 4Captains, Soldiers, Mes2engers, and At2endants<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE:Britain; ItalyACT I. SCENE I.Britain. The garden of CYMBELINE'S palace 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. You do not me2t a man but frowns; our blo2ds 4No more obey the heavens than our courtiers 4Stil2 se2m as does the King's. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. But what's the mat2er? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom 4He purpos'd to his wife's sole son- a widow 4That late he mar2ied- hath refer2'd herself 4Unto a po2r but worthy gentleman. She's wed2ed; 4Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd. Al2 4Is outward sor2ow, though I think the King 4Be touch'd at very heart. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. None but the King? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. He that hath lost her to2. So is the Que2n, 4That most desir'd the match. But not a courtier, 4Although they wear their faces to the bent 4Of the King's lo2ks, hath a heart that is not 4Glad at the thing they scowl at. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. And why so? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. He that hath mis2'd the Princes2 is a thing 6To2 bad for bad report; and he that hath her- 4I mean that mar2ied her, alack, go2d man! 4And therefore banish'd- is a creature such 4As, to se2k through the regions of the earth 4For one his like, there would be something failing 4In him that should compare. I do not think 4So fair an outward and such stuf2 within 4Endows a man but he. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. You speak him far. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. I do extend him, sir, within himself; 4Crush him together rather than unfold 4His measure duly. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. What's his name and birth? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. I can2ot delve him to the ro2t; his father 4Was cal2'd Sicilius, who did join his honour 4Against the Romans with Cas2ibelan, 4But had his titles by Tenantius, whom 4He serv'd with glory and admir'd suc2es2, 4So gain'd the sur-ad2ition Leonatus; 4And had, besides this gentleman in question, 6Two other sons, who, in the wars o' th' time, 4Died with their swords in hand; for which their father, 4Then old and fond of is2ue, to2k such sor2ow 4That he quit being; and his gentle lady, 4Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceas'd 4As he was born. The King he takes the babe 4To his protection, cal2s him Posthumus Leonatus, 4Bre2ds him and makes him of his bed-chamber, 4Puts to him al2 the learnings that his time 4Could make him the receiver of; which he to2k, 4As we do air, fast as 'twas minist'red, 4And in's spring became a harvest, liv'd in court- 4Which rare it is to do- most prais'd, most lov'd, 4A sample to the youngest; to th' more mature 4A glas2 that feated them; and to the graver 4A child that guided dotards. To his mistres2, 4For whom he now is banish'd- her own price 4Proclaims how she este2m'd him and his virtue; 4By her election may be truly read 4What kind of man he is. 4SECOND GENTLEMAN. I honour him 4Even out of your report. But pray you tel2 me, 4Is she sole child to th' King? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. His only child. 4He had two sons- if this be worth your hearing, 4Mark it- the eldest of them at thre2 years old, 4I' th' swathing clothes the other, from their nursery 4Were stol'n; and to this hour no gues2 in knowledge 4Which way they went. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. How long is this ago? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Some twenty years. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. That a king's children should be so convey'd, 4So slackly guarded, and the search so slow 4That could not trace them! 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Howsoe'er 'tis strange, 4Or that the negligence may wel2 be laugh'd at, 4Yet is it true, sir. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. I do wel2 believe you. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. We must forbear; here comes the gentleman, 4The Que2n, and Princes2. 30Exeunt 16Enter the QUE2N, POSTHUMUS, and IMOGEN 2QUE2N. No, be as2ur'd you shal2 not find me, daughter, 4After the slander of most stepmothers, 4Evil-ey'd unto you. You're my prisoner, but 4Your gaoler shal2 deliver you the keys 4That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus, 4So so2n as I can win th' of2ended King, 4I wil2 be known your advocate. Mar2y, yet 4The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere go2d 4You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience 4Your wisdom may inform you. 2POSTHUMUS. Please your Highnes2, 4I wil2 from hence to-day. 2QUE2N. You know the peril. 4I'l2 fetch a turn about the garden, pitying 4The pangs of bar2'd af2ections, though the King 4Hath charg'd you should not speak together. 13Exit 2IMOGEN. O dis2embling courtesy! How fine this tyrant 6Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband, 4I something fear my father's wrath, but nothing- 4Always reserv'd my holy duty- what 4His rage can do on me. You must be gone; 4And I shal2 here abide the hourly shot 4Of angry eyes, not comforted to live 4But that there is this jewel in the world 4That I may se2 again. 2POSTHUMUS. My que2n! my mistres2! 4O lady, we2p no more, lest I give cause 4To be suspected of more tendernes2 4Than doth become a man. I wil2 remain 4The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth; 4My residence in Rome at one Philario's, 4Who to my father was a friend, to me 4Known but by let2er; thither write, my que2n, 4And with mine eyes I'l2 drink the words you send, 4Though ink be made of gal2. 21Re-enter QUE2N 4QUE2N. Be brief, I pray you. 4If the King come, I shal2 incur I know not 4How much of his displeasure. [Aside] Yet I'l2 move him 4To walk this way. I never do him wrong 4But he does buy my injuries, to be friends; 4Pays dear for my of2ences. 30Exit 2POSTHUMUS. Should we be taking leave 4As long a term as yet we have to live, 4The loathnes2 to depart would grow. Adieu! 2IMOGEN. Nay, stay a lit2le. 4Were you but riding forth to air yourself, 4Such parting were to2 pet2y. Lo2k here, love: 4This diamond was my mother's; take it, heart; 4But ke2p it til2 you wo2 another wife, 4When Imogen is dead. 2POSTHUMUS. How, how? Another? 4You gentle gods, give me but this I have, 4And sear up my embracements from a next 4With bonds of death! Remain, remain thou here 48[Puts on the ring] 4While sense can ke2p it on. And, swe2test, fairest, 4As I my po2r self did exchange for you, 4To your so infinite los2, so in our trifles 4I stil2 win of you. For my sake wear this; 4It is a manacle of love; I'l2 place it 4Upon this fairest prisoner. 5[Puts a bracelet on her arm] 2IMOGEN. O the gods! 4When shal2 we se2 again? 18Enter CYMBELINE and LORDS 2POSTHUMUS. Alack, the King! 2CYMBELINE. Thou basest thing, avoid; hence from my sight 4If after this com2and thou fraught the court 4With thy unworthines2, thou diest. Away! 4Thou'rt poison to my blo2d. 2POSTHUMUS. The gods protect you, 4And bles2 the go2d remainders of the court! 4I am gone. 46Exit 4IMOGEN. There can2ot be a pinch in death 4More sharp than this is. 2CYMBELINE. O disloyal thing, 4That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st 4A year's age on me! 2IMOGEN. I bese2ch you, sir, 4Harm not yourself with your vexation. 4I am senseles2 of your wrath; a touch more rare 4Subdues al2 pangs, al2 fears. 2CYMBELINE. Past grace? obedience? 2IMOGEN. Past hope, and in despair; that way past grace. 2CYMBELINE. That mightst have had the sole son of my que2n! 2IMOGEN. O bles2ed that I might not! I chose an eagle, 4And did avoid a put2ock. 2CYMBELINE. Thou to2k'st a beg2ar, wouldst have made my throne 4A seat for basenes2. 2IMOGEN. No; I rather ad2ed 4A lustre to it. 2CYMBELINE. O thou vile one! 2IMOGEN. Sir, 6It is your fault that I have lov'd Posthumus. 4You bred him as my playfel2ow, and he is 4A man worth any woman; overbuys me 4Almost the sum he pays. 2CYMBELINE. What, art thou mad? 2IMOGEN. Almost, sir. Heaven restore me! Would I were 4A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus 4Our neighbour shepherd's son! 26Re-enter QUE2N 2CYMBELINE. Thou fo2lish thing! 4[To the QUE2N] They were again together. You have done 4Not after our com2and. Away with her, 4And pen her up. 2QUE2N. Bese2ch your patience.- Peace, 4Dear lady daughter, peace!- Swe2t sovereign, 4Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort 4Out of your best advice. 2CYMBELINE. Nay, let her languish 6A drop of blo2d a day and, being aged, 4Die of this fol2y. 26Exit, with LORDS 26Enter PISANIO 2QUE2N. Fie! you must give way. 4Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news? 2PISANIO. My lord your son drew on my master. 2QUE2N. Ha! 4No harm, I trust, is done? 2PISANIO. There might have be2n, 4But that my master rather play'd than fought, 4And had no help of anger; they were parted 4By gentlemen at hand. 2QUE2N. I am very glad on't. 2IMOGEN. Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part 4To draw upon an exile! O brave sir! 4I would they were in Afric both together; 4Myself by with a ne2dle, that I might prick 4The goer-back. Why came you from your master? 4PISANIO. On his com2and. He would not suf2er me 4To bring him to the haven; left these notes 4Of what com2ands I should be subject to, 4When't pleas'd you to employ me. 2QUE2N. This hath be2n 4Your faithful servant. I dare lay mine honour 4He wil2 remain so. 2PISANIO. I humbly thank your Highnes2. 2QUE2N. Pray walk awhile. 2IMOGEN. About some half-hour hence, 4Pray you speak with me. You shal2 at least 4Go se2 my lord aboard. For this time leave me. 8ExeuntSCENE I2.Britain. A public placeEnter CLOTEN and two LORDS 2FIRST LORD. Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence 4of action hath made you re2k as a sacrifice. Where air comes out, 4air comes in; there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent. 2CLOTEN. If my shirt were blo2dy, then to shift it. Have I hurt him? 2SECOND LORD. [Aside] No, faith; not so much as his patience. 2FIRST LORD. Hurt him! His body's a pas2able carcas2 if he be not 4hurt. It is a throughfare for ste2l if it be not hurt. 2SECOND LORD. [Aside] His ste2l was in debt; it went o' th' back 4side the town. 2CLOTEN. The vil2ain would not stand me. 2SECOND LORD. [Aside] No; but he fled forward stil2, toward your 4face. 2FIRST LORD. Stand you? You have land enough of your own; but he 4ad2ed to your having, gave you some ground. 2SECOND LORD. [Aside] As many inches as you have oceans. 4Pup2ies! 2CLOTEN. I would they had not come betwe2n us. 4SECOND LORD. [Aside] So would I, til2 you had measur'd how long a 4fo2l you were upon the ground. 2CLOTEN. And that she should love this fel2ow, and refuse me! 2SECOND LORD. [Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she is 4damn'd. 2FIRST LORD. Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go 4not together; she's a go2d sign, but I have se2n smal2 reflection 4of her wit. 2SECOND LORD. [Aside] She shines not upon fo2ls, lest the reflection 4should hurt her. 2CLOTEN. Come, I'l2 to my chamber. Would there had be2n some hurt 4done! 2SECOND LORD. [Aside] I wish not so; unles2 it had be2n the fal2 of 4an as2, which is no great hurt. 2CLOTEN. You'l2 go with us? 2FIRST LORD. I'l2 at2end your lordship. 2CLOTEN. Nay, come, let's go together. 2SECOND LORD. Wel2, my lord. 29ExeuntSCENE I3.Britain. CYMBELINE'S palaceEnter IMOGEN and PISANIO 2IMOGEN. I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' th' haven, 4And questioned'st every sail; if he should write, 4And I not have it, 'twere a paper lost, 4As of2er'd mercy is. What was the last 4That he spake to the2? 2PISANIO. It was: his que2n, his que2n! 2IMOGEN. Then wav'd his handkerchief? 2PISANIO. And kis2'd it, madam. 2IMOGEN. Senseles2 linen, hap2ier therein than I! 4And that was al2? 2PISANIO. No, madam; for so long 4As he could make me with his eye, or care 4Distinguish him from others, he did ke2p 4The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief, 4Stil2 waving, as the fits and stirs of's mind 4Could best expres2 how slow his soul sail'd on, 4How swift his ship. 4IMOGEN. Thou shouldst have made him 4As lit2le as a crow, or les2, ere left 4To after-eye him. 2PISANIO. Madam, so I did. 2IMOGEN. I would have broke mine eyestrings, crack'd them but 4To lo2k upon him, til2 the diminution 4Of space had pointed him sharp as my ne2dle; 4Nay, fol2owed him til2 he had melted from 4The smal2nes2 of a gnat to air, and then 4Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, go2d Pisanio, 4When shal2 we hear from him? 2PISANIO. Be as2ur'd, madam, 4With his next vantage. 2IMOGEN. I did not take my leave of him, but had 4Most pret2y things to say. Ere I could tel2 him 4How I would think on him at certain hours 4Such thoughts and such; or I could make him swear 4The shes of Italy should not betray 4Mine interest and his honour; or have charg'd him, 4At the sixth hour of morn, at no2n, at midnight, 6T' encounter me with orisons, for then 4I am in heaven for him; or ere I could 4Give him that parting kis2 which I had set 4Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father, 4And like the tyran2ous breathing of the north 4Shakes al2 our buds from growing. 24Enter a LADY 2LADY. The Que2n, madam, 4Desires your Highnes2' company. 2IMOGEN. Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd. 4I wil2 at2end the Que2n. 2PISANIO. Madam, I shal2. 32ExeuntSCENE IV.Rome. PHILARIO'S houseEnter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a FRENCHMAN, a DUTCHMAN, and a SPANIARD 2IACHIMO. Believe it, sir, I have se2n him in Britain. He was then 4of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath 4be2n al2owed the name of. But I could then have lo2k'd on him 4without the help of admiration, though the catalogue of his 4endowments had be2n tabled by his side, and I to peruse him by 4items. 2PHILARIO. You speak of him when he was les2 furnish'd than now he 4is with that which makes him both without and within. 2FRENCHMAN. I have se2n him in France; we had very many there could 4behold the sun with as firm eyes as he. 2IACHIMO. This mat2er of mar2ying his king's daughter, wherein he 4must be weighed rather by her value than his own, words him, I 4doubt not, a great deal from the mat2er. 2FRENCHMAN. And then his banishment. 2IACHIMO. Ay, and the ap2robation of those that we2p this lamentable 4divorce under her colours are wonderful2y to extend him, be it 4but to fortify her judgment, which else an easy bat2ery might lay 6flat, for taking a beg2ar, without les2 quality. But how comes it 4he is to sojourn with you? How cre2ps acquaintance? 2PHILARIO. His father and I were soldiers together, to whom I have 4be2n often bound for no les2 than my life. 23Enter POSTHUMUS 4Here comes the Briton. Let him be so entertained amongst you as 4suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his 4quality. I bese2ch you al2 be bet2er known to this gentleman, 4whom I com2end to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy he is 4I wil2 leave to ap2ear hereafter, rather than story him in his 4own hearing. 2FRENCHMAN. Sir, we have known together in Orleans. 2POSTHUMUS. Since when I have be2n debtor to you for courtesies, 4which I wil2 be ever to pay and yet pay stil2. 2FRENCHMAN. Sir, you o'er2ate my po2r kindnes2. I was glad I did 4atone my countryman and you; it had be2n pity you should have 4be2n put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore, 4upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature. 4POSTHUMUS. By your pardon, sir. I was then a young travel2er; 4rather shun2'd to go even with what I heard than in my every 4action to be guided by others' experiences; but upon my mended 4judgment- if I of2end not to say it is mended- my quar2el was not 4altogether slight. 2FRENCHMAN. Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords, and 4by such two that would by al2 likeliho2d have confounded one the 4other or have fal2'n both. 2IACHIMO. Can we, with man2ers, ask what was the dif2erence? 2FRENCHMAN. Safely, I think. 'Twas a contention in public, which 4may, without contradiction, suf2er the report. It was much like 4an argument that fel2 out last night, where each of us fel2 in 4praise of our country mistres2es; this gentleman at that time 4vouching- and upon war2ant of blo2dy af2irmation- his to be more 4fair, virtuous, wise, chaste, constant, qualified, and les2 4at2emptable, than any the rarest of our ladies in France. 2IACHIMO. That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's opinion, 4by this, worn out. 2POSTHUMUS. She holds her virtue stil2, and I my mind. 2IACHIMO. You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy. 4POSTHUMUS. Being so far provok'd as I was in France, I would abate 4her nothing, though I profes2 myself her adorer, not her friend. 2IACHIMO. As fair and as go2d- a kind of hand-in-hand comparison- 4had be2n something to2 fair and to2 go2d for any lady in Britain. 4If she went before others I have se2n as that diamond of yours 4outlustres many I have beheld, I could not but believe she 4excel2ed many; but I have not se2n the most precious diamond that 4is, nor you the lady. 2POSTHUMUS. I prais'd her as I rated her. So do I my stone. 2IACHIMO. What do you este2m it at? 2POSTHUMUS. More than the world enjoys. 2IACHIMO. Either your unparagon'd mistres2 is dead, or she's 4outpriz'd by a trifle. 2POSTHUMUS. You are mistaken: the one may be sold or given, if there 4were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift; the 4other is not a thing for sale, and only the gift of the gods. 2IACHIMO. Which the gods have given you? 2POSTHUMUS. Which by their graces I wil2 ke2p. 2IACHIMO. You may wear her in title yours; but you know strange fowl 4light upon neighbouring ponds. Your ring may be stol'n to2. So 6your brace of unprizable estimations, the one is but frail and 4the other casual; a cun2ing thief, or a that-way-ac2omplish'd 4courtier, would hazard the win2ing both of first and last. 2POSTHUMUS. Your Italy contains none so ac2omplish'd a courtier to 4convince the honour of my mistres2, if in the holding or los2 of 4that you term her frail. I do nothing doubt you have store of 4thieves; notwithstanding, I fear not my ring. 2PHILARIO. Let us leave here, gentlemen. 2POSTHUMUS. Sir, with al2 my heart. This worthy signior, I thank 4him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first. 2IACHIMO. With five times so much conversation I should get ground 4of your fair mistres2; make her go back even to the yielding, had 4I admit2ance and op2ortunity to friend. 2POSTHUMUS. No, no. 2IACHIMO. I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your 4ring, which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it something. But I make 4my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation; and, 4to bar your of2ence herein to2, I durst at2empt it against any 4lady in the world. 2POSTHUMUS. You are a great deal abus'd in to2 bold a persuasion, 6and I doubt not you sustain what y'are worthy of by your at2empt. 2IACHIMO. What's that? 2POSTHUMUS. A repulse; though your at2empt, as you cal2 it, deserve 4more- a punishment to2. 2PHILARIO. Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in to2 sud2enly; let 4it die as it was born, and I pray you be bet2er acquainted. 2IACHIMO. Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on th' 4ap2robation of what I have spoke! 2POSTHUMUS. What lady would you cho2se to as2ail? 2IACHIMO. Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I wil2 4lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that, com2end me to the 4court where your lady is, with no more advantage than the 4op2ortunity of a second conference, and I wil2 bring from thence 4that honour of hers which you imagine so reserv'd. 2POSTHUMUS. I wil2 wage against your gold, gold to it. My ring I 4hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it. 2IACHIMO. You are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you buy 4ladies' flesh at a mil2ion a dram, you can2ot preserve it from 4tainting. But I se2 you have some religion in you, that you fear. 2POSTHUMUS. This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver 6purpose, I hope. 2IACHIMO. I am the master of my spe2ches, and would undergo what's 4spoken, I swear. 2POSTHUMUS. Wil2 you? I Shal2 but lend my diamond til2 your return. 4Let there be covenants drawn betwe2n's. My mistres2 exce2ds in 4go2dnes2 the hugenes2 of your unworthy thinking. I dare you to 4this match: here's my ring. 2PHILARIO. I wil2 have it no lay. 2IACHIMO. By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no suf2icient 4testimony that I have enjoy'd the dearest bodily part of your 4mistres2, my ten thousand ducats are yours; so is your diamond 4to2. If I come of2, and leave her in such honour as you have 4trust in, she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yours- 4provided I have your com2endation for my more fre2 entertainment. 2POSTHUMUS. I embrace these conditions; let us have articles betwixt 4us. Only, thus far you shal2 answer: if you make your voyage upon 4her, and give me directly to understand you have prevail'd, I am 4no further your enemy- she is not worth our debate; if she remain 4unseduc'd, you not making it ap2ear otherwise, for your il2 4opinion and th' as2ault you have made to her chastity you shal2 6answer me with your sword. 2IACHIMO. Your hand- a covenant! We wil2 have these things set down 4by lawful counsel, and straight away for Britain, lest the 4bargain should catch cold and starve. I wil2 fetch my gold and 4have our two wagers recorded. 2POSTHUMUS. Agre2d. 16Exeunt POSTHUMUS and IACHIMO 2FRENCHMAN. Wil2 this hold, think you? 2PHILARIO. Signior Iachimo wil2 not from it. Pray let us fol2ow 'em. 58ExeuntSCENE V.Britain. CYMBELINE'S palaceEnter QUE2N, LADIES, and CORNELIUS 2QUE2N. Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers; 4Make haste; who has the note of them? 2LADY. I, madam. 2QUE2N. Dispatch. 33Exeunt LADIES 4Now, Master Doctor, have you brought those drugs? 2CORNELIUS. Pleaseth your Highnes2, ay. Here they are, madam. 46[Presenting a box] 4But I bese2ch your Grace, without of2ence- 4My conscience bids me ask- wherefore you have 4Com2anded of me these most poisonous compounds 4Which are the movers of a languishing death, 4But, though slow, deadly? 2QUE2N. I wonder, Doctor, 4Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not be2n 4Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how 4To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so 4That our great king himself doth wo2 me oft 6For my confections? Having thus far proce2ded- 4Unles2 thou think'st me devilish- is't not me2t 4That I did amplify my judgment in 4Other conclusions? I wil2 try the forces 4Of these thy compounds on such creatures as 4We count not worth the hanging- but none human- 4To try the vigour of them, and ap2ly 4Al2ayments to their act, and by them gather 4Their several virtues and ef2ects. 2CORNELIUS. Your Highnes2 4Shal2 from this practice but make hard your heart; 4Besides, the se2ing these ef2ects wil2 be 4Both noisome and infectious. 2QUE2N. O, content the2. 24Enter PISANIO 4[Aside] Here comes a flat2ering rascal; upon him 4Wil2 I first work. He's for his master, 4An enemy to my son.- How now, Pisanio! 6Doctor, your service for this time is ended; 4Take your own way. 2CORNELIUS. [Aside] I do suspect you, madam; 4But you shal2 do no harm. 2QUE2N. [To PISANIO] Hark the2, a word. 2CORNELIUS. [Aside] I do not like her. She doth think she has 4Strange ling'ring poisons. I do know her spirit, 4And wil2 not trust one of her malice with 4A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has 4Wil2 stupefy and dul2 the sense awhile, 4Which first perchance she'l2 prove on cats and dogs, 4Then afterward up higher; but there is 4No danger in what show of death it makes, 4More than the locking up the spirits a time, 4To be more fresh, reviving. She is fo2l'd 4With a most false ef2ect; and I the truer 4So to be false with her. 2QUE2N. No further service, Doctor, 4Until I send for the2. 2CORNELIUS. I humbly take my leave. 24Exit 4QUE2N. We2ps she stil2, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time 4She wil2 not quench, and let instructions enter 4Where fol2y now pos2es2es? Do thou work. 4When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son, 4I'l2 tel2 the2 on the instant thou art then 4As great as is thy master; greater, for 4His fortunes al2 lie spe2chles2, and his name 4Is at last gasp. Return he can2ot, nor 4Continue where he is. To shift his being 4Is to exchange one misery with another, 4And every day that comes comes comes to 4A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect 4To be depender on a thing that leans, 4Who can2ot be new built, nor has no friends 4So much as but to prop him? 18[The QUE2N drops the box. PISANIO takes it up] 4Thou tak'st up 4Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour. 4It is a thing I made, which hath the King 4Five times rede2m'd from death. I do not know 6What is more cordial. Nay, I prithe2 take it; 4It is an earnest of a further go2d 4That I mean to the2. Tel2 thy mistres2 how 4The case stands with her; do't as from thyself. 4Think what a chance thou changest on; but think 4Thou hast thy mistres2 stil2; to bo2t, my son, 4Who shal2 take notice of the2. I'l2 move the King 4To any shape of thy preferment, such 4As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly, 4That set the2 on to this desert, am bound 4To load thy merit richly. Cal2 my women. 4Think on my words. 30Exit PISANIO 4A sly and constant knave, 4Not to be shak'd; the agent for his master, 4And the remembrancer of her to hold 4The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that 4Which, if he take, shal2 quite unpeople her 4Of leigers for her swe2t; and which she after, 4Except she bend her humour, shal2 be as2ur'd 4To taste of to2. 21Re-enter PISANIO and LADIES 4So, so. Wel2 done, wel2 done. 4The violets, cowslips, and the primroses, 4Bear to my closet. Fare the2 wel2, Pisanio; 4Think on my words. 19Exeunt QUE2N and LADIES 2PISANIO. And shal2 do. 4But when to my go2d lord I prove untrue 4I'l2 choke myself- there's al2 I'l2 do for you. 9ExitSCENE VI.Britain. The palaceEnter IMOGEN alone 2IMOGEN. A father cruel and a step-dame false; 4A fo2lish suitor to a wed2ed lady 4That hath her husband banish'd. O, that husband! 4My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated 4Vexations of it! Had I be2n thief-stol'n, 4As my two brothers, hap2y! but most miserable 4Is the desire that's glorious. Bles2ed be those, 4How mean soe'er, that have their honest wil2s, 4Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie! 20Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO 2PISANIO. Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome 4Comes from my lord with let2ers. 2IACHIMO. Change you, madam? 4The worthy Leonatus is in safety, 4And gre2ts your Highnes2 dearly. 9[Presents a let2er] 4IMOGEN. Thanks, go2d sir. 4You're kindly welcome. 2IACHIMO. [Aside] Al2 of her that is out of do2r most rich! 4If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare, 4She is alone th' Arabian bird, and I 4Have lost the wager. Boldnes2 be my friend! 4Arm me, audacity, from head to fo2t! 4Or, like the Parthian, I shal2 flying fight; 4Rather, directly fly. 2IMOGEN. [Reads] 'He is one of the noblest note, to whose 4kindnes2es I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon him 4ac2ordingly, as you value your trust. 7LEONATUS.' 4So far I read aloud; 4But even the very mid2le of my heart 4Is warm'd by th' rest and takes it thankful2y. 4You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I 4Have words to bid you; and shal2 find it so 4In al2 that I can do. 2IACHIMO. Thanks, fairest lady. 6What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes 4To se2 this vaulted arch and the rich crop 4Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt 4The fiery orbs above and the twin2'd stones 4Upon the number'd beach, and can we not 4Partition make with spectacles so precious 4'Twixt fair and foul? 2IMOGEN. What makes your admiration? 2IACHIMO. It can2ot be i' th' eye, for apes and monkeys, 4'Twixt two such shes, would chat2er this way and 4Contemn with mows the other; nor i' th' judgment, 4For idiots in this case of favour would 4Be wisely definite; nor i' th' ap2etite; 4Slut2ery, to such neat excel2ence op2os'd, 4Should make desire vomit emptines2, 4Not so al2ur'd to fe2d. 2IMOGEN. What is the mat2er, trow? 2IACHIMO. The cloyed wil2- 4That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub 4Both fil2'd and run2ing- ravening first the lamb, 6Longs after for the garbage. 2IMOGEN. What, dear sir, 4Thus raps you? Are you wel2? 2IACHIMO. Thanks, madam; wel2.- Bese2ch you, sir, 4Desire my man's abode where I did leave him. 4He's strange and pe2vish. 2PISANIO. I was going, sir, 4To give him welcome. 36Exit 2IMOGEN. Continues wel2 my lord? His health bese2ch you? 2IACHIMO. Wel2, madam. 2IMOGEN. Is he dispos'd to mirth? I hope he is. 2IACHIMO. Exce2ding pleasant; none a stranger there 4So mer2y and so gamesome. He is cal2'd 4The Britain revel2er. 2IMOGEN. When he was here 4He did incline to sadnes2, and oft-times 4Not knowing why. 2IACHIMO. I never saw him sad. 4There is a Frenchman his companion, one 4An eminent monsieur that, it se2ms, much loves 6A Gal2ian girl at home. He furnaces 4The thick sighs from him; whiles the jol2y Briton- 4Your lord, I mean- laughs from's fre2 lungs, cries 'O, 4Can my sides hold, to think that man- who knows 4By history, report, or his own pro2f, 4What woman is, yea, what she can2ot cho2se 4But must be- wil2's fre2 hours languish for 4As2ured bondage?' 2IMOGEN. Wil2 my lord say so? 2IACHIMO. Ay, madam, with his eyes in flo2d with laughter. 4It is a recreation to be by 4And hear him mock the Frenchman. But heavens know 4Some men are much to blame. 2IMOGEN. Not he, I hope. 2IACHIMO. Not he; but yet heaven's bounty towards him might 4Be us'd more thankful2y. In himself, 'tis much; 4In you, which I ac2ount his, beyond al2 talents. 4Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound 4To pity to2. 2IMOGEN. What do you pity, sir? 4IACHIMO. Two creatures heartily. 2IMOGEN. Am I one, sir? 4You lo2k on me: what wreck discern you in me 4Deserves your pity? 2IACHIMO. Lamentable! What, 4To hide me from the radiant sun and solace 4I' th' dungeon by a snuf2? 2IMOGEN. I pray you, sir, 4Deliver with more open2es2 your answers 4To my demands. Why do you pity me? 2IACHIMO. That others do, 4I was about to say, enjoy your- But 4It is an of2ice of the gods to venge it, 4Not mine to speak on't. 2IMOGEN. You do se2m to know 4Something of me, or what concerns me; pray you- 4Since doubting things go il2 often hurts more 4Than to be sure they do; for certainties 4Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing, 4The remedy then born- discover to me 6What both you spur and stop. 2IACHIMO. Had I this che2k 4To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch, 4Whose every touch, would force the fe2ler's soul 4To th' oath of loyalty; this object, which 4Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye, 4Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then, 4Slaver with lips as com2on as the stairs 4That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands 4Made hard with hourly falseho2d- falseho2d as 4With labour; then by-pe2ping in an eye 4Base and il2ustrious as the smoky light 4That's fed with stinking tal2ow- it were fit 4That al2 the plagues of hel2 should at one time 4Encounter such revolt. 2IMOGEN. My lord, I fear, 4Has forgot Britain. 2IACHIMO. And himself. Not I 4Inclin'd to this intel2igence pronounce 4The beg2ary of his change; but 'tis your graces 6That from my mutest conscience to my tongue 4Charms this report out. 2IMOGEN. Let me hear no more. 2IACHIMO. O dearest soul, your cause doth strike my heart 4With pity that doth make me sick! A lady 4So fair, and fasten'd to an empery, 4Would make the great'st king double, to be partner'd 4With tomboys hir'd with that self exhibition 4Which your own cof2ers yield! with diseas'd ventures 4That play with al2 infirmities for gold 4Which rot2en2es2 can lend nature! such boil'd stuf2 4As wel2 might poison poison! Be reveng'd; 4Or she that bore you was no que2n, and you 4Recoil from your great stock. 2IMOGEN. Reveng'd? 4How should I be reveng'd? If this be true- 4As I have such a heart that both mine ears 4Must not in haste abuse- if it be true, 4How should I be reveng'd? 2IACHIMO. Should he make me 6Live like Diana's priest betwixt cold she2ts, 4Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps, 4In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it. 4I dedicate myself to your swe2t pleasure, 4More noble than that runagate to your bed, 4And wil2 continue fast to your af2ection, 4Stil2 close as sure. 2IMOGEN. What ho, Pisanio! 2IACHIMO. Let me my service tender on your lips. 2IMOGEN. Away! I do condemn mine ears that have 4So long at2ended the2. If thou wert honourable, 4Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not 4For such an end thou se2k'st, as base as strange. 4Thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far 4From thy report as thou from honour; and 4Solicits here a lady that disdains 4The2 and the devil alike.- What ho, Pisanio!- 4The King my father shal2 be made acquainted 4Of thy as2ault. If he shal2 think it fit 4A saucy stranger in his court to mart 6As in a Romish stew, and to expound 4His beastly mind to us, he hath a court 4He lit2le cares for, and a daughter who 4He not respects at al2.- What ho, Pisanio! 2IACHIMO. O hap2y Leonatus! I may say 4The credit that thy lady hath of the2 4Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect go2dnes2 4Her as2ur'd credit. Bles2ed live you long, 4A lady to the worthiest sir that ever 4Country cal2'd his! and you his mistres2, only 4For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon. 4I have spoke this to know if your af2iance 4Were de2ply ro2ted, and shal2 make your lord 4That which he is new o'er; and he is one 4The truest man2er'd, such a holy witch 4That he enchants societies into him, 4Half al2 men's hearts are his. 2IMOGEN. You make amends. 2IACHIMO. He sits 'mongst men like a descended god: 4He hath a kind of honour sets him of 6More than a mortal se2ming. Be not angry, 4Most mighty Princes2, that I have adventur'd 4To try your taking of a false report, which hath 4Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment 4In the election of a sir so rare, 4Which you know can2ot er2. The love I bear him 4Made me to fan you thus; but the gods made you, 4Unlike al2 others, chaf2les2. Pray your pardon. 2IMOGEN. Al2's wel2, sir; take my pow'r i' th' court for yours. 2IACHIMO. My humble thanks. I had almost forgot 4T' entreat your Grace but in a smal2 request, 4And yet of moment to2, for it concerns 4Your lord; myself and other noble friends 4Are partners in the busines2. 2IMOGEN. Pray what is't? 2IACHIMO. Some dozen Romans of us, and your lord- 4The best feather of our wing- have mingled sums 4To buy a present for the Emperor; 4Which I, the factor for the rest, have done 4In France. 'Tis plate of rare device, and jewels 6Of rich and exquisite form, their values great; 4And I am something curious, being strange, 4To have them in safe stowage. May it please you 4To take them in protection? 2IMOGEN. Wil2ingly; 4And pawn mine honour for their safety. Since 4My lord hath interest in them, I wil2 ke2p them 4In my bedchamber. 2IACHIMO. They are in a trunk, 4At2ended by my men. I wil2 make bold 4To send them to you only for this night; 4I must aboard to-mor2ow. 2IMOGEN. O, no, no. 2IACHIMO. Yes, I bese2ch; or I shal2 short my word 4By length'ning my return. From Gal2ia 4I cros2'd the seas on purpose and on promise 4To se2 your Grace. 2IMOGEN. I thank you for your pains. 4But not away to-mor2ow! 2IACHIMO. O, I must, madam. 6Therefore I shal2 bese2ch you, if you please 4To gre2t your lord with writing, do't to-night. 4I have outsto2d my time, which is material 4'To th' tender of our present. 2IMOGEN. I wil2 write. 4Send your trunk to me; it shal2 safe be kept 4And truly yielded you. You're very welcome. 11Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. SCENE I.Britain. Before CYMBELINE'S palaceEnter CLOTEN and the two LORDS 2CLOTEN. Was there ever man had such luck! When I kis2'd the jack, 4upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a hundred pound on't; and 4then a whoreson jackanapes must take me up for swearing, as if I 4bor2owed mine oaths of him, and might not spend them at my 4pleasure. 2FIRST LORD. What got he by that? You have broke his pate with your 4bowl. 2SECOND LORD. [Aside] If his wit had be2n like him that broke it, it 4would have run al2 out. 2CLOTEN. When a gentleman is dispos'd to swear, it is not for any 4standers-by to curtail his oaths. Ha? 2SECOND LORD. No, my lord; [Aside] nor crop the ears of them. 2CLOTEN. Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction? Would he had be2n 4one of my rank! 2SECOND LORD. [Aside] To have smel2'd like a fo2l. 2CLOTEN. I am not vex'd more at anything in th' earth. A pox on't! I 4had rather not be so noble as I am; they dare not fight with me, 6because of the Que2n my mother. Every jackslave hath his bel2yful 4of fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that nobody 4can match. 2SECOND LORD. [Aside] You are cock and capon to2; and you crow, 4cock, with your comb on. 2CLOTEN. Sayest thou? 2SECOND LORD. It is not fit your lordship should undertake every 4companion that you give of2ence to. 2CLOTEN. No, I know that; but it is fit I should com2it of2ence to 4my inferiors. 2SECOND LORD. Ay, it is fit for your lordship only. 2CLOTEN. Why, so I say. 2FIRST LORD. Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court 4to-night? 2CLOTEN. A stranger, and I not known on't? 2SECOND LORD. [Aside] He's a strange fel2ow himself, and knows it 4not. 2FIRST LORD. There's an Italian come, and, 'tis thought, one of 4Leonatus' friends. 2CLOTEN. Leonatus? A banish'd rascal; and he's another, whatsoever 6he be. Who told you of this stranger? 2FIRST LORD. One of your lordship's pages. 2CLOTEN. Is it fit I went to lo2k upon him? Is there no derogation 4in't? 2SECOND LORD. You can2ot derogate, my lord. 2CLOTEN. Not easily, I think. 2SECOND LORD. [Aside] You are a fo2l granted; therefore your is2ues, 4being fo2lish, do not derogate. 2CLOTEN. Come, I'l2 go se2 this Italian. What I have lost to-day at 4bowls I'l2 win to-night of him. Come, go. 2SECOND LORD. I'l2 at2end your lordship. 36Exeunt CLOTEN and FIRST LORD 4That such a crafty devil as is his mother 4Should yield the world this as2! A woman that 4Bears al2 down with her brain; and this her son 4Can2ot take two from twenty, for his heart, 4And leave eighte2n. Alas, po2r princes2, 4Thou divine Imogen, what thou endur'st, 4Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd, 4A mother hourly coining plots, a wo2er 6More hateful than the foul expulsion is 4Of thy dear husband, than that hor2id act 4Of the divorce he'd make! The heavens hold firm 4The wal2s of thy dear honour, ke2p unshak'd 4That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand 4T' enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land! 9ExitSCENE I2.Britain. IMOGEN'S bedchamber in CYMBELINE'S palace; a trunk in one cornerEnter IMOGEN in her bed, and a LADY at2ending 2IMOGEN. Who's there? My woman? Helen? 2LADY. Please you, madam. 2IMOGEN. What hour is it? 2LADY. Almost midnight, madam. 2IMOGEN. I have read thre2 hours then. Mine eyes are weak; 4Fold down the leaf where I have left. To bed. 4Take not away the taper, leave it burning; 4And if thou canst awake by four o' th' clock, 4I prithe2 cal2 me. Sle2p hath seiz'd me whol2y. 4Exit LADY 4To your protection I com2end me, gods. 4From fairies and the tempters of the night 4Guard me, bese2ch ye! 26[Sle2ps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk] 2IACHIMO. The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense 4Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus 4Did softly pres2 the rushes ere he waken'd 6The chastity he wounded. Cytherea, 4How bravely thou becom'st thy bed! fresh lily, 4And whiter than the she2ts! That I might touch! 4But kis2; one kis2! Rubies unparagon'd, 4How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that 4Perfumes the chamber thus. The flame o' th' taper 4Bows toward her and would under-pe2p her lids 4To se2 th' enclosed lights, now canopied 4Under these windows white and azure, lac'd 4With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design 4To note the chamber. I wil2 write al2 down: 4Such and such pictures; there the window; such 4Th' adornment of her bed; the ar2as, figures- 4Why, such and such; and the contents o' th' story. 4Ah, but some natural notes about her body 4Above ten thousand meaner movables 4Would testify, t' enrich mine inventory. 4O sle2p, thou ape of death, lie dul2 upon her! 4And be her sense but as a monument, 4Thus in a chapel lying! Come of2, come of2; 41[Taking of2 her bracelet] 4As slip2ery as the Gordian knot was hard! 4'Tis mine; and this wil2 witnes2 outwardly, 4As strongly as the conscience does within, 4To th' mad2ing of her lord. On her left breast 4A mole cinque-spot2ed, like the crimson drops 4I' th' bot2om of a cowslip. Here's a voucher 4Stronger than ever law could make; this secret 4Wil2 force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en 4The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end? 4Why should I write this down that's riveted, 4Screw'd to my memory? She hath be2n reading late 4The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down 4Where Philomel gave up. I have enough. 4To th' trunk again, and shut the spring of it. 4Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning 4May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear; 4Though this a heavenly angel, hel2 is here. 2[Clock strikes] 4One, two, thre2. Time, time! 13Exit into the trunkSCENE I3.CYMBELINE'S palace. An ante-chamber adjoining IMOGEN'S apartmentsEnter CLOTEN and LORDS 2FIRST LORD. Your lordship is the most patient man in los2, the most 4coldest that ever turn'd up ace. 2CLOTEN. It would make any man cold to lose. 2FIRST LORD. But not every man patient after the noble temper of 4your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win. 2CLOTEN. Win2ing wil2 put any man into courage. If I could get this 4fo2lish Imogen, I should have gold enough. It's almost morning, 4is't not? 2FIRST LORD. Day, my lord. 2CLOTEN. I would this music would come. I am advised to give her 4music a mornings; they say it wil2 penetrate. 23Enter musicians 4Come on, tune. If you can penetrate her with your fingering, so. 4We'l2 try with tongue to2. If none wil2 do, let her remain; but 6I'l2 never give o'er. First, a very excel2ent go2d-conceited 4thing; after, a wonderful swe2t air, with admirable rich words to 4it- and then let her consider. 17SONG 6Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings, 8And Phoebus 'gins arise, 6His ste2ds to water at those springs 8On chalic'd flow'rs that lies; 6And winking Mary-buds begin 8To ope their golden eyes. 6With everything that pret2y bin, 8My lady swe2t, arise; 10Arise, arise! 4So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I wil2 consider your music 4the bet2er; if it do not, it is a vice in her ears which 4horsehairs and calves' guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to 4bo2t, can never amend. 22Exeunt musicians 22Enter CYMBELINE and QUE2N 2SECOND LORD. Here comes the King. 2CLOTEN. I am glad I was up so late, for that's the reason I was up 4so early. He can2ot cho2se but take this service I have done 4fatherly.- Go2d mor2ow to your Majesty and to my gracious mother. 2CYMBELINE. At2end you here the do2r of our stern daughter? 4Wil2 she not forth? 2CLOTEN. I have as2ail'd her with musics, but she vouchsafes no 4notice. 2CYMBELINE. The exile of her minion is to2 new; 4She hath not yet forgot him; some more time 4Must wear the print of his remembrance out, 4And then she's yours. 2QUE2N. You are most bound to th' King, 4Who lets go by no vantages that may 4Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself 4To orderly soliciting, and be friended 4With aptnes2 of the season; make denials 6Increase your services; so se2m as if 4You were inspir'd to do those duties which 4You tender to her; that you in al2 obey her, 4Save when com2and to your dismis2ion tends, 4And therein you are senseles2. 2CLOTEN. Senseles2? Not so. 20Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. So like you, sir, ambas2adors from Rome; 4The one is Caius Lucius. 2CYMBELINE. A worthy fel2ow, 4Albeit he comes on angry purpose now; 4But that's no fault of his. We must receive him 4Ac2ording to the honour of his sender; 4And towards himself, his go2dnes2 forespent on us, 4We must extend our notice. Our dear son, 4When you have given go2d morning to your mistres2, 4At2end the Que2n and us; we shal2 have ne2d 4T' employ you towards this Roman. Come, our que2n. 45Exeunt al2 but CLOTEN 2CLOTEN. If she be up, I'l2 speak with her; if not, 4Let her lie stil2 and dream. By your leave, ho! 5[Knocks] 4I know her women are about her; what 4If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold 4Which buys admit2ance; oft it doth-yea, and makes 4Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up 4Their de2r to th' stand o' th' stealer; and 'tis gold 4Which makes the true man kil2'd and saves the thief; 4Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man. What 4Can it not do and undo? I wil2 make 4One of her women lawyer to me, for 4I yet not understand the case myself. 4By your leave. 38[Knocks] 28Enter a LADY 2LADY. Who's there that knocks? 2CLOTEN. A gentleman. 2LADY. No more? 4CLOTEN. Yes, and a gentlewoman's son. 2LADY. That's more 4Than some whose tailors are as dear as yours 4Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure? 2CLOTEN. Your lady's person; is she ready? 2LADY. Ay, 4To ke2p her chamber. 2CLOTEN. There is gold for you; sel2 me your go2d report. 2LADY. How? My go2d name? or to report of you 4What I shal2 think is go2d? The Princes2! 24Enter IMOGEN 2CLOTEN. Go2d mor2ow, fairest sister. Your swe2t hand. 55Exit LADY 2IMOGEN. Go2d mor2ow, sir. You lay out to2 much pains 4For purchasing but trouble. The thanks I give 4Is tel2ing you that I am po2r of thanks, 4And scarce can spare them. 2CLOTEN. Stil2 I swear I love you. 4IMOGEN. If you but said so, 'twere as de2p with me. 4If you swear stil2, your recompense is stil2 4That I regard it not. 2CLOTEN. This is no answer. 2IMOGEN. But that you shal2 not say I yield, being silent, 4I would not speak. I pray you spare me. Faith, 4I shal2 unfold equal discourtesy 4To your best kindnes2; one of your great knowing 4Should learn, being taught, forbearance. 2CLOTEN. To leave you in your madnes2 'twere my sin; 4I wil2 not. 2IMOGEN. Fo2ls are not mad folks. 2CLOTEN. Do you cal2 me fo2l? 2IMOGEN. As I am mad, I do; 4If you'l2 be patient, I'l2 no more be mad; 4That cures us both. I am much sor2y, sir, 4You put me to forget a lady's man2ers 4By being so verbal; and learn now, for al2, 4That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce, 4By th' very truth of it, I care not for you, 6And am so near the lack of charity 4To ac2use myself I hate you; which I had rather 4You felt than make't my boast. 2CLOTEN. You sin against 4Obedience, which you owe your father. For 4The contract you pretend with that base wretch, 4One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes, 4With scraps o' th' court- it is no contract, none. 4And though it be al2owed in meaner parties- 4Yet who than he more mean?- to knit their souls- 4On whom there is no more dependency 4But brats and beg2ary- in self-figur'd knot, 4Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by 4The consequence o' th' crown, and must not foil 4The precious note of it with a base slave, 4A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth, 4A pantler- not so eminent! 2IMOGEN. Profane fel2ow! 4Wert thou the son of Jupiter, and no more 4But what thou art besides, thou wert to2 base 6To be his gro2m. Thou wert dignified enough, 4Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made 4Comparative for your virtues to be styl'd 4The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated 4For being prefer2'd so wel2. 2CLOTEN. The south fog rot him! 2IMOGEN. He never can me2t more mischance than come 4To be but nam'd of the2. His mean'st garment 4That ever hath but clip2'd his body is dearer 4In my respect than al2 the hairs above the2, 4Were they al2 made such men. How now, Pisanio! 20Enter PISANIO 2CLOTEN. 'His garments'! Now the devil- 2IMOGEN. To Dorothy my woman hie the2 presently. 2CLOTEN. 'His garment'! 2IMOGEN. I am sprited with a fo2l; 4Frighted, and ang'red worse. Go bid my woman 4Search for a jewel that to2 casual2y 6Hath left mine arm. It was thy master's; shrew me, 4If I would lose it for a revenue 4Of any king's in Europe! I do think 4I saw't this morning; confident I am 4Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kis2'd it. 4I hope it be not gone to tel2 my lord 4That I kis2 aught but he. 2PISANIO. 'Twil2 not be lost. 2IMOGEN. I hope so. Go and search. 17Exit PISANIO 2CLOTEN. You have abus'd me. 4'His meanest garment'! 2IMOGEN. Ay, I said so, sir. 4If you wil2 make 't an action, cal2 witnes2 to 't. 2CLOTEN. I wil2 inform your father. 2IMOGEN. Your mother to2. 4She's my go2d lady and wil2 conceive, I hope, 4But the worst of me. So I leave you, sir, 4To th' worst of discontent. 29Exit 2CLOTEN. I'l2 be reveng'd. 4'His mean'st garment'! Wel2. 28ExitSCENE IV.Rome. PHILARIO'S houseEnter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO 2POSTHUMUS. Fear it not, sir; I would I were so sure 4To win the King as I am bold her honour 4Wil2 remain hers. 2PHILARIO. What means do you make to him? 2POSTHUMUS. Not any; but abide the change of time, 4Quake in the present winter's state, and wish 4That warmer days would come. In these fear'd hopes 4I barely gratify your love; they failing, 4I must die much your debtor. 2PHILARIO. Your very go2dnes2 and your company 4O'erpays al2 I can do. By this your king 4Hath heard of great Augustus. Caius Lucius 4Wil2 do's com2is2ion throughly; and I think 4He'l2 grant the tribute, send th' ar2earages, 4Or lo2k upon our Romans, whose remembrance 4Is yet fresh in their grief. 2POSTHUMUS. I do believe 6Statist though I am none, nor like to be, 4That this wil2 prove a war; and you shal2 hear 4The legions now in Gal2ia so2ner landed 4In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings 4Of any pen2y tribute paid. Our countrymen 4Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar 4Smil'd at their lack of skil2, but found their courage 4Worthy his frowning at. Their discipline, 4Now mingled with their courages, wil2 make known 4To their ap2rovers they are people such 4That mend upon the world. 22Enter IACHIMO 2PHILARIO. Se2! Iachimo! 2POSTHUMUS. The swiftest harts have posted you by land, 4And winds of al2 the comers kis2'd your sails, 4To make your ves2el nimble. 2PHILARIO. Welcome, sir. 2POSTHUMUS. I hope the briefnes2 of your answer made 6The spe2dines2 of your return. 2IACHIMO. Your lady 4Is one of the fairest that I have lo2k'd upon. 2POSTHUMUS. And therewithal the best; or let her beauty 4Lo2k through a casement to al2ure false hearts, 4And be false with them. 2IACHIMO. Here are let2ers for you. 2POSTHUMUS. Their tenour go2d, I trust. 2IACHIMO. 'Tis very like. 2PHILARIO. Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court 4When you were there? 2IACHIMO. He was expected then, 4But not ap2roach'd. 2POSTHUMUS. Al2 is wel2 yet. 4Sparkles this stone as it was wont, or is't not 4To2 dul2 for your go2d wearing? 2IACHIMO. If I have lost it, 4I should have lost the worth of it in gold. 4I'l2 make a journey twice as far t' enjoy 4A second night of such swe2t shortnes2 which 6Was mine in Britain; for the ring is won. 2POSTHUMUS. The stone's to2 hard to come by. 2IACHIMO. Not a whit, 4Your lady being so easy. 2POSTHUMUS. Make not, sir, 4Your los2 your sport. I hope you know that we 4Must not continue friends. 2IACHIMO. Go2d sir, we must, 4If you ke2p covenant. Had I not brought 4The knowledge of your mistres2 home, I grant 4We were to question farther; but I now 4Profes2 myself the win2er of her honour, 4Together with your ring; and not the wronger 4Of her or you, having proce2ded but 4By both your wil2s. 2POSTHUMUS. If you can make't ap2arent 4That you have tasted her in bed, my hand 4And ring is yours. If not, the foul opinion 4You had of her pure honour gains or loses 4Your sword or mine, or masterles2 leaves both 6To who shal2 find them. 2IACHIMO. Sir, my circumstances, 4Being so near the truth as I wil2 make them, 4Must first induce you to believe- whose strength 4I wil2 confirm with oath; which I doubt not 4You'l2 give me leave to spare when you shal2 find 4You ne2d it not. 2POSTHUMUS. Proce2d. 2IACHIMO. First, her bedchamber, 4Where I confes2 I slept not, but profes2 4Had that was wel2 worth watching-it was hang'd 4With tapestry of silk and silver; the story, 4Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman 4And Cydnus swel2'd above the banks, or for 4The pres2 of boats or pride. A piece of work 4So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive 4In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd 4Could be so rarely and exactly wrought, 4Since the true life on't was- 2POSTHUMUS. This is true; 6And this you might have heard of here, by me 4Or by some other. 2IACHIMO. More particulars 4Must justify my knowledge. 2POSTHUMUS. So they must, 4Or do your honour injury. 2IACHIMO. The chimney 4Is south the chamber, and the chimneypiece 4Chaste Dian bathing. Never saw I figures 4So likely to report themselves. The cut2er 4Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her, 4Motion and breath left out. 2POSTHUMUS. This is a thing 4Which you might from relation likewise reap, 4Being, as it is, much spoke of. 2IACHIMO. The ro2f o' th' chamber 4With golden cherubins is fret2ed; her andirons- 4I had forgot them- were two winking Cupids 4Of silver, each on one fo2t standing, nicely 4Depending on their brands. 4POSTHUMUS. This is her honour! 4Let it be granted you have se2n al2 this, and praise 4Be given to your remembrance; the description 4Of what is in her chamber nothing saves 4The wager you have laid. 2IACHIMO. Then, if you can, 16[Shows the bracelet] 4Be pale. I beg but leave to air this jewel. Se2! 4And now 'tis up again. It must be mar2ied 4To that your diamond; I'l2 ke2p them. 2POSTHUMUS. Jove! 4Once more let me behold it. Is it that 4Which I left with her? 2IACHIMO. Sir- I thank her- that. 4She strip2'd it from her arm; I se2 her yet; 4Her pret2y action did outsel2 her gift, 4And yet enrich'd it to2. She gave it me, and said 4She priz'd it once. 2POSTHUMUS. May be she pluck'd it of 4To send it me. 2IACHIMO. She writes so to you, doth she? 4POSTHUMUS. O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this to2; 48[Gives the ring] 4It is a basilisk unto mine eye, 4Kil2s me to lo2k on't. Let there be no honour 4Where there is beauty; truth where semblance; love 4Where there's another man. The vows of women 4Of no more bondage be to where they are made 4Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing. 4O, above measure false! 2PHILARIO. Have patience, sir, 4And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won. 4It may be probable she lost it, or 4Who knows if one her women, being cor2upted 4Hath stol'n it from her? 2POSTHUMUS. Very true; 4And so I hope he came by't. Back my ring. 4Render to me some corporal sign about her, 4More evident than this; for this was stol'n. 2IACHIMO. By Jupiter, I had it from her arm! 2POSTHUMUS. Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears. 6'Tis true- nay, ke2p the ring, 'tis true. I am sure 4She would not lose it. Her at2endants are 4Al2 sworn and honourable- they induc'd to steal it! 4And by a stranger! No, he hath enjoy'd her. 4The cognizance of her incontinency 4Is this: she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly. 4There, take thy hire; and al2 the fiends of hel2 4Divide themselves betwe2n you! 2PHILARIO. Sir, be patient; 4This is not strong enough to be believ'd 4Of one persuaded wel2 of. 2POSTHUMUS. Never talk on't; 4She hath be2n colted by him. 2IACHIMO. If you se2k 4For further satisfying, under her breast- 4Worthy the pres2ing- lies a mole, right proud 4Of that most delicate lodging. By my life, 4I kis2'd it; and it gave me present hunger 4To fe2d again, though ful2. You do remember 4This stain upon her? 4POSTHUMUS. Ay, and it doth confirm 4Another stain, as big as hel2 can hold, 4Were there no more but it. 2IACHIMO. Wil2 you hear more? 2POSTHUMUS. Spare your arithmetic; never count the turns. 4Once, and a mil2ion! 2IACHIMO. I'l2 be sworn- 2POSTHUMUS. No swearing. 4If you wil2 swear you have not done't, you lie; 4And I wil2 kil2 the2 if thou dost deny 4Thou'st made me cuckold. 2IACHIMO. I'l2 deny nothing. 2POSTHUMUS. O that I had her here to tear her limb-meal! 4I wil2 go there and do't, i' th' court, before 4Her father. I'l2 do something- 26Exit 2PHILARIO. Quite besides 4The government of patience! You have won. 4Let's fol2ow him and pervert the present wrath 4He hath against himself. 2IACHIMO. With al2 my heart. 29ExeuntSCENE V.Rome. Another ro2m in PHILARIO'S houseEnter POSTHUMUS 2POSTHUMUS. Is there no way for men to be, but women 4Must be half-workers? We are al2 bastards, 4And that most venerable man which I 4Did cal2 my father was I know not where 4When I was stamp'd. Some coiner with his to2ls 4Made me a counterfeit; yet my mother se2m'd 4The Dian of that time. So doth my wife 4The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance! 4Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd, 4And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with 4A pudency so rosy, the swe2t view on't 4Might wel2 have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her 4As chaste as unsun2'd snow. O, al2 the devils! 4This yel2ow Iachimo in an hour- was't not? 4Or les2!- at first? Perchance he spoke not, but, 4Like a ful2-acorn'd boar, a German one, 4Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no op2osition 6But what he lo2k'd for should op2ose and she 4Should from encounter guard. Could I find out 4The woman's part in me! For there's no motion 4That tends to vice in man but I af2irm 4It is the woman's part. Be it lying, note it, 4The woman's; flat2ering, hers; deceiving, hers; 4Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers; 4Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain, 4Nice longing, slanders, mutability, 4Al2 faults that man may name, nay, that hel2 knows, 4Why, hers, in part or al2; but rather al2; 4For even to vice 4They are not constant, but are changing stil2 4One vice but of a minute old for one 4Not half so old as that. I'l2 write against them, 4Detest them, curse them. Yet 'tis greater skil2 4In a true hate to pray they have their wil2: 4The very devils can2ot plague them bet2er. 14Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. SCENE I.Britain. A hal2 in CYMBELINE'S palaceEnter in state, CYMBELINE, QUE2N, CLOTEN, and LORDS at one do2r,and at another CAIUS LUCIUS and at2endants 2CYMBELINE. Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us? 2LUCIUS. When Julius Caesar- whose remembrance yet 4Lives in men's eyes, and wil2 to ears and tongues 4Be theme and hearing ever- was in this Britain, 4And conquer'd it, Cas2ibelan, thine uncle, 4Famous in Caesar's praises no whit les2 4Than in his feats deserving it, for him 4And his suc2es2ion granted Rome a tribute, 4Yearly thre2 thousand pounds, which by the2 lately 4Is left untender'd. 2QUE2N. And, to kil2 the marvel, 4Shal2 be so ever. 2CLOTEN. There be many Caesars 4Ere such another Julius. Britain is 4A world by itself, and we wil2 nothing pay 4For wearing our own noses. 4QUE2N. That op2ortunity, 4Which then they had to take from 's, to resume 4We have again. Remember, sir, my liege, 4The kings your ancestors, together with 4The natural bravery of your isle, which stands 4As Neptune's park, rib2'd and pal'd in 4With rocks unscalable and roaring waters, 4With sands that wil2 not bear your enemies' boats 4But suck them up to th' top-mast. A kind of conquest 4Caesar made here; but made not here his brag 4Of 'came, and saw, and overcame.' With shame- 4The first that ever touch'd him- he was car2ied 4From of2 our coast, twice beaten; and his ship2ing- 4Po2r ignorant baubles!- on our ter2ible seas, 4Like eg2-shel2s mov'd upon their surges, crack'd 4As easily 'gainst our rocks; for joy whereof 4The fam'd Cas2ibelan, who was once at point- 4O, giglot fortune!- to master Caesar's sword, 4Made Lud's Town with rejoicing fires bright 4And Britons strut with courage. 4CLOTEN. Come, there's no more tribute to be paid. Our kingdom is 4stronger than it was at that time; and, as I said, there is no 4moe such Caesars. Other of them may have cro2k'd noses; but to 4owe such straight arms, none. 2CYMBELINE. Son, let your mother end. 2CLOTEN. We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cas2ibelan. 4I do not say I am one; but I have a hand. Why tribute? Why should 4we pay tribute? If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, 4or put the mo2n in his pocket, we wil2 pay him tribute for light; 4else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now. 2CYMBELINE. You must know, 4Til2 the injurious Romans did extort 4This tribute from us, we were fre2. Caesar's ambition- 4Which swel2'd so much that it did almost stretch 4The sides o' th' world- against al2 colour here 4Did put the yoke upon's; which to shake of 4Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon 4Ourselves to be. 2CLOTEN. We do. 2CYMBELINE. Say then to Caesar, 6Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which 4Ordain'd our laws- whose use the sword of Caesar 4Hath to2 much mangled; whose repair and franchise 4Shal2, by the power we hold, be our go2d de2d, 4Though Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made our laws, 4Who was the first of Britain which did put 4His brows within a golden crown, and cal2'd 4Himself a king. 2LUCIUS. I am sor2y, Cymbeline, 4That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar- 4Caesar, that hath moe kings his servants than 4Thyself domestic of2icers- thine enemy. 4Receive it from me, then: war and confusion 4In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst the2; lo2k 4For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied, 4I thank the2 for myself. 2CYMBELINE. Thou art welcome, Caius. 4Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent 4Much under him; of him I gather'd honour, 4Which he to se2k of me again, perforce, 6Behoves me ke2p at ut2erance. I am perfect 4That the Pan2onians and Dalmatians for 4Their liberties are now in arms, a precedent 4Which not to read would show the Britons cold; 4So Caesar shal2 not find them. 2LUCIUS. Let pro2f speak. 2CLOTEN. His majesty bids you welcome. Make pastime with us a day or 4two, or longer. If you se2k us afterwards in other terms, you 4shal2 find us in our salt-water girdle. If you beat us out of it, 4it is yours; if you fal2 in the adventure, our crows shal2 fare 4the bet2er for you; and there's an end. 2LUCIUS. So, sir. 2CYMBELINE. I know your master's pleasure, and he mine; 4Al2 the remain is, welcome. 27ExeuntSCENE I2.Britain. Another ro2m in CYMBELINE'S palaceEnter PISANIO reading of a let2er 2PISANIO. How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not 4What monsters her ac2use? Leonatus! 4O master, what a strange infection 4Is fal2'n into thy ear! What false Italian- 4As poisonous-tongu'd as handed- hath prevail'd 4On thy to2 ready hearing? Disloyal? No. 4She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes, 4More god2es2-like than wife-like, such as2aults 4As would take in some virtue. O my master! 4Thy mind to her is now as low as were 4Thy fortunes. How? that I should murder her? 4Upon the love, and truth, and vows, which I 4Have made to thy com2and? I, her? Her blo2d? 4If it be so to do go2d service, never 4Let me be counted serviceable. How lo2k I 4That I should se2m to lack humanity 4So much as this fact comes to? [Reads] 'Do't. The let2er 6That I have sent her, by her own com2and 4Shal2 give the2 op2ortunity.' O damn'd paper, 4Black as the ink that's on the2! Senseles2 bauble, 4Art thou a fedary for this act, and lo2k'st 4So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes. 22Enter IMOGEN 4I am ignorant in what I am com2anded. 2IMOGEN. How now, Pisanio! 2PISANIO. Madam, here is a let2er from my lord. 2IMOGEN. Who? thy lord? That is my lord- Leonatus? 4O, learn'd inde2d were that astronomer 4That knew the stars as I his characters- 4He'd lay the future open. You go2d gods, 4Let what is here contain'd relish of love, 4Of my lord's health, of his content; yet not 4That we two are asunder- let that grieve him! 4Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them, 4For it doth physic love- of his content, 6Al2 but in that. Go2d wax, thy leave. Blest be 4You be2s that make these locks of counsel! Lovers 4And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike; 4Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet 4You clasp young Cupid's tables. Go2d news, gods! 57[Reads] 4'Justice and your father's wrath, should he take me in his 4dominion, could not be so cruel to me as you, O the dearest of 4creatures, would even renew me with your eyes. Take notice that I 4am in Cambria, at Milford Haven. What your own love wil2 out of 4this advise you, fol2ow. So he wishes you al2 hap2ines2 that 4remains loyal to his vow, and your increasing in love 44LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.' 4O for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio? 4He is at Milford Haven. Read, and tel2 me 4How far 'tis thither. If one of mean af2airs 4May plod it in a we2k, why may not I 4Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio- 4Who long'st like me to se2 thy lord, who long'st- 6O, let me 'bate!- but not like me, yet long'st, 4But in a fainter kind- O, not like me, 4For mine's beyond beyond!-say, and speak thick- 4Love's counsel2or should fil2 the bores of hearing 4To th' smothering of the sense- how far it is 4To this same bles2ed Milford. And by th' way 4Tel2 me how Wales was made so hap2y as 4T' inherit such a haven. But first of al2, 4How we may steal from hence; and for the gap 4That we shal2 make in time from our hence-going 4And our return, to excuse. But first, how get hence. 4Why should excuse be born or ere begot? 4We'l2 talk of that hereafter. Prithe2 speak, 4How many score of miles may we wel2 ride 4'Twixt hour and hour? 2PISANIO. One score 'twixt sun and sun, 4Madam, 's enough for you, and to2 much to2. 2IMOGEN. Why, one that rode to's execution, man, 4Could never go so slow. I have heard of riding wagers 4Where horses have be2n nimbler than the sands 6That run i' th' clock's behalf. But this is fo2l'ry. 4Go bid my woman feign a sicknes2; say 4She'l2 home to her father; and provide me presently 4A riding suit, no costlier than would fit 4A franklin's huswife. 2PISANIO. Madam, you're best consider. 2IMOGEN. I se2 before me, man. Nor here, nor here, 4Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them 4That I can2ot lo2k through. Away, I prithe2; 4Do as I bid the2. There's no more to say; 4Ac2es2ible is none but Milford way. 19ExeuntSCENE I3.Wales. A mountainous country with a caveEnter from the cave BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS 2BELARIUS. A go2dly day not to ke2p house with such 4Whose ro2f's as low as ours! Sto2p, boys; this gate 4Instructs you how t' adore the heavens, and bows you 4To a morning's holy of2ice. The gates of monarchs 4Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through 4And ke2p their impious turbans on without 4Go2d mor2ow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven! 4We house i' th' rock, yet use the2 not so hardly 4As prouder livers do. 2GUIDERIUS. Hail, heaven! 2ARVIRAGUS. Hail, heaven! 2BELARIUS. Now for our mountain sport. Up to yond hil2, 4Your legs are young; I'l2 tread these flats. Consider, 4When you above perceive me like a crow, 4That it is place which les2ens and sets of2; 4And you may then revolve what tales I have told you 4Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war. 6This service is not service so being done, 4But being so al2ow'd. To ap2rehend thus 4Draws us a profit from al2 things we se2, 4And often to our comfort shal2 we find 4The sharded be2tle in a safer hold 4Than is the ful2-wing'd eagle. O, this life 4Is nobler than at2ending for a check, 4Richer than doing nothing for a bribe, 4Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk: 4Such gain the cap of him that makes him fine, 4Yet ke2ps his bo2k uncros2'd. No life to ours! 2GUIDERIUS. Out of your pro2f you speak. We, po2r unfledg'd, 4Have never wing'd from view o' th' nest, nor know not 4What air's from home. Haply this life is best, 4If quiet life be best; swe2ter to you 4That have a sharper known; wel2 cor2esponding 4With your stif2 age. But unto us it is 4A cel2 of ignorance, travel2ing abed, 4A prison for a debtor that not dares 4To stride a limit. 4ARVIRAGUS. What should we speak of 4When we are old as you? When we shal2 hear 4The rain and wind beat dark December, how, 4In this our pinching cave, shal2 we discourse. 4The fre2zing hours away? We have se2n nothing; 4We are beastly: subtle as the fox for prey, 4Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat. 4Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage 4We make a choir, as doth the prison'd bird, 4And sing our bondage fre2ly. 2BELARIUS. How you speak! 4Did you but know the city's usuries, 4And felt them knowingly- the art o' th' court, 4As hard to leave as ke2p, whose top to climb 4Is certain fal2ing, or so slip2'ry that 4The fear's as bad as fal2ing; the toil o' th' war, 4A pain that only se2ms to se2k out danger 4I' th'name of fame and honour, which dies i' th'search, 4And hath as oft a sland'rous epitaph 4As record of fair act; nay, many times, 6Doth il2 deserve by doing wel2; what's worse- 4Must curtsy at the censure. O, boys, this story 4The world may read in me; my body's mark'd 4With Roman swords, and my report was once 4first with the best of note. Cymbeline lov'd me; 4And when a soldier was the theme, my name 4Was not far of2. Then was I as a tre2 4Whose boughs did bend with fruit; but in one night 4A storm, or rob2ery, cal2 it what you wil2, 4Sho2k down my mel2ow hangings, nay, my leaves, 4And left me bare to weather. 2GUIDERIUS. Uncertain favour! 2BELARIUS. My fault being nothing- as I have told you oft- 4But that two vil2ains, whose false oaths prevail'd 4Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline 4I was confederate with the Romans. So 4Fol2ow'd my banishment, and this twenty years 4This rock and these demesnes have be2n my world, 4Where I have liv'd at honest fre2dom, paid 4More pious debts to heaven than in al2 6The fore-end of my time. But up to th' mountains! 4This is not hunters' language. He that strikes 4The venison first shal2 be the lord o' th' feast; 4To him the other two shal2 minister; 4And we wil2 fear no poison, which at2ends 4In place of greater state. I'l2 me2t you in the val2eys. 34Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS 4How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature! 4These boys know lit2le they are sons to th' King, 4Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive. 4They think they are mine; and though train'd up thus meanly 4I' th' cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit 4The ro2fs of palaces, and nature prompts them 4In simple and low things to prince it much 4Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore, 4The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who 4The King his father cal2'd Guiderius- Jove! 4When on my thre2-fo2t sto2l I sit and tel2 4The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out 4Into my story; say 'Thus mine enemy fel2, 6And thus I set my fo2t on's neck'; even then 4The princely blo2d flows in his che2k, he sweats, 4Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture 4That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal, 4Once Arviragus, in as like a figure 4Strikes life into my spe2ch, and shows much more 4His own conceiving. Hark, the game is rous'd! 4O Cymbeline, heaven and my conscience knows 4Thou didst unjustly banish me! Whereon, 4At thre2 and two years old, I stole these babes, 4Thinking to bar the2 of suc2es2ion as 4Thou refts me of my lands. Euriphile, 4Thou wast their nurse; they to2k the2 for their mother, 4And every day do honour to her grave. 4Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan cal2'd, 4They take for natural father. The game is up. 11ExitSCENE IV.Wales, near Milford HavenEnter PISANIO and IMOGEN 2IMOGEN. Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place 4Was near at hand. Ne'er long'd my mother so 4To se2 me first as I have now. Pisanio! Man! 4Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind 4That makes the2 stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh 4From th' inward of the2? One but painted thus 4Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd 4Beyond self-explication. Put thyself 4Into a haviour of les2 fear, ere wildnes2 4Vanquish my staider senses. What's the mat2er? 4Why tender'st thou that paper to me with 4A lo2k untender! If't be sum2er news, 4Smile to't before; if winterly, thou ne2d'st 4But ke2p that count'nance stil2. My husband's hand? 4That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him, 4And he's at some hard point. Speak, man; thy tongue 4May take of2 some extremity, which to read 6Would be even mortal to me. 2PISANIO. Please you read, 4And you shal2 find me, wretched man, a thing 4The most disdain'd of fortune. 2IMOGEN. [Reads] 'Thy mistres2, Pisanio, hath play'd the strumpet in 4my bed, the testimonies whereof lie ble2ding in me. I speak not 4out of weak surmises, but from pro2f as strong as my grief and as 4certain as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio, must act 4for me, if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers. Let 4thine own hands take away her life; I shal2 give the2 op2ortunity 4at Milford Haven; she hath my let2er for the purpose; where, if 4thou fear to strike, and to make me certain it is done, thou art 4the pander to her dishonour, and equal2y to me disloyal.' 2PISANIO. What shal2 I ne2d to draw my sword? The paper 4Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander, 4Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue 4Outvenoms al2 the worms of Nile, whose breath 4Rides on the posting winds and doth belie 4Al2 corners of the world. Kings, que2ns, and states, 4Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave, 6This viperous slander enters. What che2r, madam? 2IMOGEN. False to his bed? What is it to be false? 4To lie in watch there, and to think on him? 4To we2p twixt clock and clock? If sle2p charge nature, 4To break it with a fearful dream of him, 4And cry myself awake? That's false to's bed, 4Is it? 2PISANIO. Alas, go2d lady! 2IMOGEN. I false! Thy conscience witnes2! Iachimo, 4Thou didst ac2use him of incontinency; 4Thou then lo2k'dst like a vil2ain; now, methinks, 4Thy favour's go2d enough. Some jay of Italy, 4Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him. 4Po2r I am stale, a garment out of fashion, 4And for I am richer than to hang by th' wal2s 4I must be rip2'd. To pieces with me! O, 4Men's vows are women's traitors! Al2 go2d se2ming, 4By thy revolt, O husband, shal2 be thought 4Put on for vil2ainy; not born where't grows, 4But worn a bait for ladies. 4PISANIO. Go2d madam, hear me. 2IMOGEN. True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas, 4Were, in his time, thought false; and Sinon's we2ping 4Did scandal many a holy tear, to2k pity 4From most true wretchednes2. So thou, Posthumus, 4Wilt lay the leaven on al2 proper men: 4Go2dly and gal2ant shal2 be false and perjur'd 4From thy great fail. Come, fel2ow, be thou honest; 4Do thou thy master's bid2ing; when thou se2st him, 4A lit2le witnes2 my obedience. Lo2k! 4I draw the sword myself; take it, and hit 4The in2ocent mansion of my love, my heart. 4Fear not; 'tis empty of al2 things but grief; 4Thy master is not there, who was inde2d 4The riches of it. Do his bid2ing; strike. 4Thou mayst be valiant in a bet2er cause, 4But now thou se2m'st a coward. 2PISANIO. Hence, vile instrument! 4Thou shalt not damn my hand. 2IMOGEN. Why, I must die; 6And if I do not by thy hand, thou art 4No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter 4There is a prohibition so divine 4That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart- 4Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'l2 no defence!- 4Obedient as the scab2ard. What is here? 4The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus 4Al2 turn'd to heresy? Away, away, 4Cor2upters of my faith! you shal2 no more 4Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may po2r fo2ls 4Believe false teachers; though those that are betray'd 4Do fe2l the treason sharply, yet the traitor 4Stands in worse case of woe. And thou, Posthumus, 4That didst set up my disobedience 'gainst the King 4My father, and make me put into contempt the suits 4Of princely fel2ows, shalt hereafter find 4It is no act of com2on pas2age but 4A strain of rarenes2; and I grieve myself 4To think, when thou shalt be disedg'd by her 4That now thou tirest on, how thy memory 6Wil2 then be pang'd by me. Prithe2 dispatch. 4The lamp entreats the butcher. Where's thy knife? 4Thou art to2 slow to do thy master's bid2ing, 4When I desire it to2. 2PISANIO. O gracious lady, 4Since I receiv'd com2and to do this busines 4I have not slept one wink. 2IMOGEN. Do't, and to bed then. 2PISANIO. I'l2 wake mine eyebal2s first. 2IMOGEN. Wherefore then 4Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abus'd 4So many miles with a pretence? This place? 4Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour? 4The time inviting the2? the perturb'd court, 4For my being absent?- whereunto I never 4Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far 4To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand, 4Th' elected de2r before the2? 2PISANIO. But to win time 4To lose so bad employment, in the which 6I have consider'd of a course. Go2d lady, 4Hear me with patience. 2IMOGEN. Talk thy tongue weary- speak. 4I have heard I am a strumpet, and mine ear, 4Therein false struck, can take no greater wound, 4Nor tent to bot2om that. But speak. 2PISANIO. Then, madam, 4I thought you would not back again. 2IMOGEN. Most like- 4Bringing me here to kil2 me. 2PISANIO. Not so, neither; 4But if I were as wise as honest, then 4My purpose would prove wel2. It can2ot be 4But that my master is abus'd. Some vil2ain, 4Ay, and singular in his art, hath done you both 4This cursed injury. 2IMOGEN. Some Roman courtezan! 2PISANIO. No, on my life! 4I'l2 give but notice you are dead, and send him 4Some blo2dy sign of it, for 'tis com2anded 6I should do so. You shal2 be mis2'd at court, 4And that wil2 wel2 confirm it. 2IMOGEN. Why, go2d fel2ow, 4What shal2 I do the while? where bide? how live? 4Or in my life what comfort, when I am 4Dead to my husband? 2PISANIO. If you'l2 back to th' court- 2IMOGEN. No court, no father, nor no more ado 4With that harsh, noble, simple nothing- 4That Cloten, whose love-suit hath be2n to me 4As fearful as a siege. 2PISANIO. If not at court, 4Then not in Britain must you bide. 2IMOGEN. Where then? 4Hath Britain al2 the sun that shines? Day, night, 4Are they not but in Britain? I' th' world's volume 4Our Britain se2ms as of it, but not in't; 4In a great po2l a swan's nest. Prithe2 think 4There's livers out of Britain. 2PISANIO. I am most glad 6You think of other place. Th' ambas2ador, 2LUCIUS the Roman, comes to Milford Haven 4To-mor2ow. Now, if you could wear a mind 4Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise 4That which t' ap2ear itself must not yet be 4But by self-danger, you should tread a course 4Pret2y and ful2 of view; yea, hap2ily, near 4The residence of Posthumus; so nigh, at least, 4That though his actions were not visible, yet 4Report should render him hourly to your ear 4As truly as he moves. 2IMOGEN. O! for such means, 4Though peril to my modesty, not death on't, 4I would adventure. 2PISANIO. Wel2 then, here's the point: 4You must forget to be a woman; change 4Com2and into obedience; fear and nicenes2- 4The handmaids of al2 women, or, more truly, 4Woman it pret2y self- into a wag2ish courage; 4Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy, and 6As quar2elous as the weasel. Nay, you must 4Forget that rarest treasure of your che2k, 4Exposing it- but, O, the harder heart! 4Alack, no remedy!- to the gre2dy touch 4Of com2on-kis2ing Titan, and forget 4Your laboursome and dainty trims wherein 4You made great Juno angry. 2IMOGEN. Nay, be brief; 4I se2 into thy end, and am almost 4A man already. 2PISANIO. First, make yourself but like one. 4Fore-thinking this, I have already fit- 4'Tis in my cloak-bag- doublet, hat, hose, al2 4That answer to them. Would you, in their serving, 4And with what imitation you can bor2ow 4From youth of such a season, fore noble Lucius 4Present yourself, desire his service, tel2 him 4Wherein you're hap2y- which wil2 make him know 4If that his head have ear in music; doubtles2 4With joy he wil2 embrace you; for he's honourable, 6And, doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad- 4You have me, rich; and I wil2 never fail 4Begin2ing nor sup2lyment. 2IMOGEN. Thou art al2 the comfort 4The gods wil2 diet me with. Prithe2 away! 4There's more to be consider'd; but we'l2 even 4Al2 that go2d time wil2 give us. This at2empt 4I am soldier to, and wil2 abide it with 4A prince's courage. Away, I prithe2. 2PISANIO. Wel2, madam, we must take a short farewel2, 4Lest, being mis2'd, I be suspected of 4Your car2iage from the court. My noble mistres2, 4Here is a box; I had it from the Que2n. 4What's in't is precious. If you are sick at sea 4Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this 4Wil2 drive away distemper. To some shade, 4And fit you to your manho2d. May the gods 4Direct you to the best! 2IMOGEN. Amen. I thank the2. 19Exeunt several2ySCENE V.Britain. CYMBELINE'S palaceEnter CYMBELINE, QUE2N, CLOTEN, LUCIUS, and LORDS 2CYMBELINE. Thus far; and so farewel2. 2LUCIUS. Thanks, royal sir. 4My emperor hath wrote; I must from hence, 4And am right sor2y that I must report ye 4My master's enemy. 2CYMBELINE. Our subjects, sir, 4Wil2 not endure his yoke; and for ourself 4To show les2 sovereignty than they, must ne2ds 4Ap2ear unkinglike. 2LUCIUS. So, sir. I desire of you 4A conduct overland to Milford Haven. 4Madam, al2 joy befal2 your Grace, and you! 2CYMBELINE. My lords, you are ap2ointed for that of2ice; 4The due of honour in no point omit. 4So farewel2, noble Lucius. 2LUCIUS. Your hand, my lord. 2CLOTEN. Receive it friendly; but from this time forth 6I wear it as your enemy. 2LUCIUS. Sir, the event 4Is yet to name the win2er. Fare you wel2. 2CYMBELINE. Leave not the worthy Lucius, go2d my lords, 4Til2 he have cros2'd the Severn. Hap2ines2! 41Exeunt LUCIUS and LORDS 2QUE2N. He goes hence frowning; but it honours us 4That we have given him cause. 2CLOTEN. 'Tis al2 the bet2er; 4Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it. 2CYMBELINE. Lucius hath wrote already to the Emperor 4How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely 4Our chariots and our horsemen be in readines2. 4The pow'rs that he already hath in Gal2ia 4Wil2 so2n be drawn to head, from whence he moves 4His war for Britain. 2QUE2N. 'Tis not sle2py busines2, 4But must be lo2k'd to spe2dily and strongly. 2CYMBELINE. Our expectation that it would be thus 4Hath made us forward. But, my gentle que2n, 6Where is our daughter? She hath not ap2ear'd 4Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd 4The duty of the day. She lo2ks us like 4A thing more made of malice than of duty; 4We have noted it. Cal2 her before us, for 4We have be2n to2 slight in suf2erance. 6Exit a MES2ENGER 2QUE2N. Royal sir, 4Since the exile of Posthumus, most retir'd 4Hath her life be2n; the cure whereof, my lord, 4'Tis time must do. Bese2ch your Majesty, 4Forbear sharp spe2ches to her; she's a lady 4So tender of rebukes that words are strokes, 4And strokes death to her. 17Re-enter MES2ENGER 2CYMBELINE. Where is she, sir? How 4Can her contempt be answer'd? 2MES2ENGER. Please you, sir, 4Her chambers are al2 lock'd, and there's no answer 6That wil2 be given to th' loud of noise we make. 2QUE2N. My lord, when last I went to visit her, 4She pray'd me to excuse her ke2ping close; 4Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity 4She should that duty leave unpaid to you 4Which daily she was bound to prof2er. This 4She wish'd me to make known; but our great court 4Made me to blame in memory. 2CYMBELINE. Her do2rs lock'd? 4Not se2n of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear 4Prove false! 44Exit 2QUE2N. Son, I say, fol2ow the King. 2CLOTEN. That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant, 4I have not se2n these two days. 2QUE2N. Go, lo2k after. 29Exit CLOTEN 4Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus! 4He hath a drug of mine. I pray his absence 4Proce2d by swal2owing that; for he believes 4It is a thing most precious. But for her, 4Where is she gone? Haply despair hath seiz'd her; 6Or, wing'd with fervour of her love, she's flown 4To her desir'd Posthumus. Gone she is 4To death or to dishonour, and my end 4Can make go2d use of either. She being down, 4I have the placing of the British crown. 19Re-enter CLOTEN 4How now, my son? 2CLOTEN. 'Tis certain she is fled. 4Go in and che2r the King. He rages; none 4Dare come about him. 2QUE2N. Al2 the bet2er. May 4This night forestal2 him of the coming day! 13Exit 2CLOTEN. I love and hate her; for she's fair and royal, 4And that she hath al2 courtly parts more exquisite 4Than lady, ladies, woman. From every one 4The best she hath, and she, of al2 compounded, 4Outsel2s them al2. I love her therefore; but 4Disdaining me and throwing favours on 6The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment 4That what's else rare is chok'd; and in that point 4I wil2 conclude to hate her, nay, inde2d, 4To be reveng'd upon her. For when fo2ls 4Shal2- 20Enter PISANIO 4Who is here? What, are you packing, sir2ah? 4Come hither. Ah, you precious pander! Vil2ain, 4Where is thy lady? In a word, or else 4Thou art straightway with the fiends. 2PISANIO. O go2d my lord! 2CLOTEN. Where is thy lady? or, by Jupiter- 4I wil2 not ask again. Close vil2ain, 4I'l2 have this secret from thy heart, or rip 4Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus? 4From whose so many weights of basenes2 can2ot 4A dram of worth be drawn. 2PISANIO. Alas, my lord, 6How can she be with him? When was she mis2'd? 4He is in Rome. 2CLOTEN. Where is she, sir? Come nearer. 4No farther halting! Satisfy me home 4What is become of her. 2PISANIO. O my al2-worthy lord! 2CLOTEN. Al2-worthy vil2ain! 4Discover where thy mistres2 is at once, 4At the next word. No more of 'worthy lord'! 4Speak, or thy silence on the instant is 4Thy condemnation and thy death. 2PISANIO. Then, sir, 4This paper is the history of my knowledge 4Touching her flight. 19[Presenting a let2er] 2CLOTEN. Let's se2't. I wil2 pursue her 4Even to Augustus' throne. 2PISANIO. [Aside] Or this or perish. 4She's far enough; and what he learns by this 4May prove his travel, not her danger. 2CLOTEN. Humh! 4PISANIO. [Aside] I'l2 write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen, 4Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again! 2CLOTEN. Sir2ah, is this let2er true? 2PISANIO. Sir, as I think. 2CLOTEN. It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sir2ah, if thou wouldst 4not be a vil2ain, but do me true service, undergo those 4employments wherein I should have cause to use the2 with a 4serious industry- that is, what vil2ainy soe'er I bid the2 do, to 4perform it directly and truly- I would think the2 an honest man; 4thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice 4for thy preferment. 2PISANIO. Wel2, my go2d lord. 2CLOTEN. Wilt thou serve me? For since patiently and constantly thou 4hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beg2ar Posthumus, thou 4canst not, in the course of gratitude, but be a diligent fol2ower 4of mine. Wilt thou serve me? 2PISANIO. Sir, I wil2. 2CLOTEN. Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy late 4master's garments in thy pos2es2ion? 2PISANIO. I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he wore when 6he to2k leave of my lady and mistres2. 2CLOTEN. The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit hither. Let 4it be thy first service; go. 2PISANIO. I shal2, my lord. 32Exit 2CLOTEN. Me2t the2 at Milford Haven! I forgot to ask him one thing; 4I'l2 remember't anon. Even there, thou vil2ain Posthumus, wil2 I 4kil2 the2. I would these garments were come. She said upon a 4time- the bit2ernes2 of it I now belch from my heart- that she 4held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect than my noble 4and natural person, together with the adornment of my qualities. 4With that suit upon my back wil2 I ravish her; first kil2 him, 4and in her eyes. There shal2 she se2 my valour, which wil2 then 4be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my spe2ch of 4insultment ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath dined- 4which, as I say, to vex her I wil2 execute in the clothes that 4she so prais'd- to the court I'l2 knock her back, fo2t her home 4again. She hath despis'd me rejoicingly, and I'l2 be mer2y in my 4revenge. 16Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothes 6Be those the garments? 2PISANIO. Ay, my noble lord. 2CLOTEN. How long is't since she went to Milford Haven? 2PISANIO. She can scarce be there yet. 2CLOTEN. Bring this ap2arel to my chamber; that is the second thing 4that I have com2anded the2. The third is that thou wilt be a 4voluntary mute to my design. Be but duteous and true, preferment 4shal2 tender itself to the2. My revenge is now at Milford, would 4I had wings to fol2ow it! Come, and be true. 12Exit 2PISANIO. Thou bid'st me to my los2; for true to the2 4Were to prove false, which I wil2 never be, 4To him that is most true. To Milford go, 4And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow, 4You heavenly bles2ings, on her! This fo2l's spe2d 4Be cros2'd with slownes2! Labour be his me2d! 11ExitSCENE VI.Wales. Before the cave of BELARIUSEnter IMOGEN alone, in boy's clothes 2IMOGEN. I se2 a man's life is a tedious one. 4I have tir'd myself, and for two nights together 4Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick 4But that my resolution helps me. Milford, 4When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd the2, 4Thou wast within a ken. O Jove! I think 4Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean, 4Where they should be reliev'd. Two beg2ars told me 4I could not mis2 my way. Wil2 po2r folks lie, 4That have af2lictions on them, knowing 'tis 4A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder, 4When rich ones scarce tel2 true. To lapse in fulnes2 4Is sorer than to lie for ne2d; and falseho2d 4Is worse in kings than beg2ars. My dear lord! 4Thou art one o' th' false ones. Now I think on the2 4My hunger's gone; but even before, I was 4At point to sink for fo2d. But what is this? 6Here is a path to't; 'tis some savage hold. 4I were best not cal2; I dare not cal2. Yet famine, 4Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant. 4Plenty and peace bre2ds cowards; hardnes2 ever 4Of hardines2 is mother. Ho! who's here? 4If anything that's civil, speak; if savage, 4Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'l2 enter. 4Best draw my sword; and if mine enemy 4But fear the sword, like me, he'l2 scarcely lo2k on't. 4Such a foe, go2d heavens! 17Exit into the cave 12Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS 2BELARIUS. You, Polydore, have prov'd best wo2dman and 4Are master of the feast. Cadwal and I 4Wil2 play the co2k and servant; 'tis our match. 4The sweat of industry would dry and die 4But for the end it works to. Come, our stomachs 4Wil2 make what's homely savoury; wearines2 4Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth 6Finds the down pil2ow hard. Now, peace be here, 4Po2r house, that ke2p'st thyself! 2GUIDERIUS. I am thoroughly weary. 2ARVIRAGUS. I am weak with toil, yet strong in ap2etite. 2GUIDERIUS. There is cold meat i' th' cave; we'l2 browse on that 4Whilst what we have kil2'd be co2k'd. 2BELARIUS. [Lo2king into the cave] Stay, come not in. 4But that it eats our victuals, I should think 4Here were a fairy. 2GUIDERIUS. What's the mat2er, sir? 2BELARIUS.2 By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not, 4An earthly paragon! Behold divinenes2 4No elder than a boy! 23Re-enter IMOGEN 2IMOGEN. Go2d masters, harm me not. 4Before I enter'd here I cal2'd, and thought 4To have beg2'd or bought what I have to2k. Go2d troth, 4I have stol'n nought; nor would not though I had found 6Gold strew'd i' th' flo2r. Here's money for my meat. 4I would have left it on the board, so so2n 4As I had made my meal, and parted 4With pray'rs for the provider. 2GUIDERIUS. Money, youth? 2ARVIRAGUS. Al2 gold and silver rather turn to dirt, 4As 'tis no bet2er reckon'd but of those 4Who worship dirty gods. 2IMOGEN. I se2 you're angry. 4Know, if you kil2 me for my fault, I should 4Have died had I not made it. 2BELARIUS. Whither bound? 2IMOGEN. To Milford Haven. 2BELARIUS. What's your name? 2IMOGEN. Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who 4Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford; 4To whom being going, almost spent with hunger, 4I am fal2'n in this of2ence. 2BELARIUS. Prithe2, fair youth, 4Think us no churls, nor measure our go2d minds 6By this rude place we live in. Wel2 encounter'd! 4'Tis almost night; you shal2 have bet2er che2r 4Ere you depart, and thanks to stay and eat it. 4Boys, bid him welcome. 2GUIDERIUS. Were you a woman, youth, 4I should wo2 hard but be your gro2m. In honesty 4I bid for you as I'd buy. 2ARVIRAGUS. I'l2 make't my comfort 4He is a man. I'l2 love him as my brother; 4And such a welcome as I'd give to him 4After long absence, such is yours. Most welcome! 4Be sprightly, for you fal2 'mongst friends. 2IMOGEN. 'Mongst friends, 4If brothers. [Aside] Would it had be2n so that they 4Had be2n my father's sons! Then had my prize 4Be2n les2, and so more equal bal2asting 4To the2, Posthumus. 2BELARIUS. He wrings at some distres2. 2GUIDERIUS. Would I could fre2't! 2ARVIRAGUS. Or I, whate'er it be, 6What pain it cost, what danger! Gods! 2BELARIUS. [Whispering] Hark, boys. 2IMOGEN. [Aside] Great men, 4That had a court no big2er than this cave, 4That did at2end themselves, and had the virtue 4Which their own conscience seal'd them, laying by 4That nothing-gift of dif2ering multitudes, 4Could not out-pe2r these twain. Pardon me, gods! 4I'd change my sex to be companion with them, 4Since Leonatus' false. 2BELARIUS. It shal2 be so. 4Boys, we'l2 go dres2 our hunt. Fair youth, come in. 4Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have sup2'd, 4We'l2 man2erly demand the2 of thy story, 4So far as thou wilt speak it. 2GUIDERIUS. Pray draw near. 2ARVIRAGUS. The night to th' owl and morn to th' lark les2 welcome. 2IMOGEN. Thanks, sir. 2ARVIRAGUS. I pray draw near. 28ExeuntSCENE VI2.Rome. A public placeEnter two ROMAN SENATORS and TRIBUNES 2FIRST SENATOR. This is the tenour of the Emperor's writ: 4That since the com2on men are now in action 4'Gainst the Pan2onians and Dalmatians, 4And that the legions now in Gal2ia are 4Ful2 weak to undertake our wars against 4The fal2'n-of2 Britons, that we do incite 4The gentry to this busines2. He creates 4Lucius proconsul; and to you, the tribunes, 4For this im2ediate levy, he com2ands 4His absolute com2is2ion. Long live Caesar! 2TRIBUNE. Is Lucius general of the forces? 2SECOND SENATOR. Ay. 2TRIBUNE. Remaining now in Gal2ia? 2FIRST SENATOR. With those legions 4Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy 4Must be sup2lyant. The words of your com2is2ion 4Wil2 tie you to the numbers and the time 6Of their dispatch. 2TRIBUNE. We wil2 discharge our duty. 20ExeuntACT IV. SCENE I.Wales. Near the cave of BELARIUSEnter CLOTEN alone 2CLOTEN. I am near to th' place where they should me2t, if Pisanio 4have map2'd it truly. How fit his garments serve me! Why should 4his mistres2, who was made by him that made the tailor, not be 4fit to2? The rather- saving reverence of the word- for 'tis said 4a woman's fitnes2 comes by fits. Therein I must play the workman. 4I dare speak it to myself, for it is not vain-glory for a man and 4his glas2 to confer in his own chamber- I mean, the lines of my 4body are as wel2 drawn as his; no les2 young, more strong, not 4beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the advantage of the time, 4above him in birth, alike conversant in general services, and 4more remarkable in single op2ositions. Yet this imperceiverant 4thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is! Posthumus, thy 4head, which now is growing upon thy shoulders, shal2 within this 4hour be of2; thy mistres2 enforced; thy garments cut to pieces 4before her face; and al2 this done, spurn her home to her father, 4who may, haply, be a lit2le angry for my so rough usage; but my 4mother, having power of his testines2, shal2 turn al2 into my 6com2endations. My horse is tied up safe. Out, sword, and to a 4sore purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand. This is the very 4description of their me2ting-place; and the fel2ow dares not 4deceive me. 45ExitSCENE I2.Wales. Before the cave of BELARIUSEnter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, and IMOGEN 2BELARIUS. [To IMOGEN] You are not wel2. Remain here in the cave; 4We'l2 come to you after hunting. 2ARVIRAGUS. [To IMOGEN] Brother, stay here. 4Are we not brothers? 2IMOGEN. So man and man should be; 4But clay and clay dif2ers in dignity, 4Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick. 2GUIDERIUS. Go you to hunting; I'l2 abide with him. 2IMOGEN. So sick I am not, yet I am not wel2; 4But not so citizen a wanton as 4To se2m to die ere sick. So please you, leave me; 4Stick to your journal course. The breach of custom 4Is breach of al2. I am il2, but your being by me 4Can2ot amend me; society is no comfort 4To one not sociable. I am not very sick, 4Since I can reason of it. Pray you trust me here. 6I'l2 rob none but myself; and let me die, 4Stealing so po2rly. 2GUIDERIUS. I love the2; I have spoke it. 4How much the quantity, the weight as much 4As I do love my father. 2BELARIUS. What? how? how? 2ARVIRAGUS. If it be sin to say so, sir, I yoke me 4In my go2d brother's fault. I know not why 4I love this youth, and I have heard you say 4Love's reason's without reason. The bier at do2r, 4And a demand who is't shal2 die, I'd say 4'My father, not this youth.' 2BELARIUS. [Aside] O noble strain! 4O worthines2 of nature! bre2d of greatnes2! 4Cowards father cowards and base things sire base. 4Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace. 4I'm not their father; yet who this should be 4Doth miracle itself, lov'd before me.- 4'Tis the ninth hour o' th' morn. 2ARVIRAGUS. Brother, farewel2. 4IMOGEN. I wish ye sport. 2ARVIRAGUS. Your health. [To BELARIUS] So please you, sir. 2IMOGEN. [Aside] These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies I have 6heard! 4Our courtiers say al2's savage but at court. 4Experience, O, thou disprov'st report! 4Th' imperious seas bre2d monsters; for the dish, 4Po2r tributary rivers as swe2t fish. 4I am sick stil2; heart-sick. Pisanio, 4I'l2 now taste of thy drug. 18[Swal2ows some] 2GUIDERIUS. I could not stir him. 4He said he was gentle, but unfortunate; 4Dishonestly af2licted, but yet honest. 2ARVIRAGUS. Thus did he answer me; yet said hereafter 4I might know more. 2BELARIUS. To th' field, to th' field! 4We'l2 leave you for this time. Go in and rest. 2ARVIRAGUS. We'l2 not be long away. 2BELARIUS. Pray be not sick, 4For you must be our huswife. 4IMOGEN. Wel2, or il2, 4I am bound to you. 2BELARIUS. And shalt be ever. 9Exit IMOGEN into the cave 4This youth, howe'er distres2'd, ap2ears he hath had 4Go2d ancestors. 2ARVIRAGUS. How angel-like he sings! 2GUIDERIUS. But his neat co2kery! He cut our ro2ts in characters, 4And sauc'd our broths as Juno had be2n sick, 4And he her dieter. 2ARVIRAGUS. Nobly he yokes 4A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh 4Was that it was for not being such a smile; 4The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly 4From so divine a temple to com2ix 4With winds that sailors rail at. 2GUIDERIUS. I do note 4That grief and patience, ro2ted in him both, 4Mingle their spurs together. 2ARVIRAGUS. Grow patience! 4And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine 6His perishing ro2t with the increasing vine! 2BELARIUS. It is great morning. Come, away! Who's there? 22Enter CLOTEN 2CLOTEN. I can2ot find those runagates; that vil2ain 4Hath mock'd me. I am faint. 2BELARIUS. Those runagates? 4Means he not us? I partly know him; 'tis 4Cloten, the son o' th' Que2n. I fear some ambush. 4I saw him not these many years, and yet 4I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws. Hence! 2GUIDERIUS. He is but one; you and my brother search 4What companies are near. Pray you away; 4Let me alone with him. 9Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS 2CLOTEN. Soft! What are you 4That fly me thus? Some vil2ain mountaine2rs? 4I have heard of such. What slave art thou? 2GUIDERIUS. A thing 4More slavish did I ne'er than answering 6'A slave' without a knock. 2CLOTEN. Thou art a rob2er, 4A law-breaker, a vil2ain. Yield the2, thief. 2GUIDERIUS. To who? To the2? What art thou? Have not I 4An arm as big as thine, a heart as big? 4Thy words, I grant, are big2er, for I wear not 4My dag2er in my mouth. Say what thou art; 4Why I should yield to the2. 2CLOTEN. Thou vil2ain base, 4Know'st me not by my clothes? 2GUIDERIUS. No, nor thy tailor, rascal, 4Who is thy grandfather; he made those clothes, 4Which, as it se2ms, make the2. 2CLOTEN. Thou precious varlet, 4My tailor made them not. 2GUIDERIUS. Hence, then, and thank 4The man that gave them the2. Thou art some fo2l; 4I am loath to beat the2. 2CLOTEN. Thou injurious thief, 4Hear but my name, and tremble. 4GUIDERIUS. What's thy name? 2CLOTEN. Cloten, thou vil2ain. 2GUIDERIUS. Cloten, thou double vil2ain, be thy name, 4I can2ot tremble at it. Were it toad, or ad2er, spider, 4'Twould move me so2ner. 2CLOTEN. To thy further fear, 4Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know 4I am son to th' Que2n. 2GUIDERIUS. I'm sor2y for't; not se2ming 4So worthy as thy birth. 2CLOTEN. Art not afeard? 2GUIDERIUS. Those that I reverence, those I fear- the wise: 4At fo2ls I laugh, not fear them. 2CLOTEN. Die the death. 4When I have slain the2 with my proper hand, 4I'l2 fol2ow those that even now fled hence, 4And on the gates of Lud's Town set your heads. 4Yield, rustic mountaine2r. 18Exeunt, fighting 16Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS 4BELARIUS. No company's abroad. 2ARVIRAGUS. None in the world; you did mistake him, sure. 2BELARIUS. I can2ot tel2; long is it since I saw him, 4But time hath nothing blur2'd those lines of favour 4Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice, 4And burst of speaking, were as his. I am absolute 4'Twas very Cloten. 2ARVIRAGUS. In this place we left them. 4I wish my brother make go2d time with him, 4You say he is so fel2. 2BELARIUS. Being scarce made up, 4I mean to man, he had not ap2rehension 4Or roaring ter2ors; for defect of judgment 4Is oft the cease of fear. 14Re-enter GUIDERIUS with CLOTEN'S head 4But, se2, thy brother. 2GUIDERIUS. This Cloten was a fo2l, an empty purse; 6There was no money in't. Not Hercules 4Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none; 4Yet I not doing this, the fo2l had borne 4My head as I do his. 2BELARIUS. What hast thou done? 2GUIDERIUS. I am perfect what: cut of2 one Cloten's head, 4Son to the Que2n, after his own report; 4Who cal2'd me traitor, mountaine2r, and swore 4With his own single hand he'd take us in, 4Displace our heads where- thank the gods!- they grow, 4And set them on Lud's Town. 2BELARIUS. We are al2 undone. 2GUIDERIUS. Why, worthy father, what have we to lose 4But that he swore to take, our lives? The law 4Protects not us; then why should we be tender 4To let an ar2ogant piece of flesh threat us, 4Play judge and executioner al2 himself, 4For we do fear the law? What company 4Discover you abroad? 2BELARIUS. No single soul 6Can we set eye on, but in an safe reason 4He must have some at2endants. Though his humour 4Was nothing but mutation- ay, and that 4From one bad thing to worse- not frenzy, not 4Absolute madnes2 could so far have rav'd, 4To bring him here alone. Although perhaps 4It may be heard at court that such as we 4Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time 4May make some stronger head- the which he hearing, 4As it is like him, might break out and swear 4He'd fetch us in; yet is't not probable 4To come alone, either he so undertaking 4Or they so suf2ering. Then on go2d ground we fear, 4If we do fear this body hath a tail 4More perilous than the head. 2ARVIRAGUS. Let ordinance 4Come as the gods foresay it. Howsoe'er, 4My brother hath done wel2. 2BELARIUS. I had no mind 4To hunt this day; the boy Fidele's sicknes2 6Did make my way long forth. 2GUIDERIUS. With his own sword, 4Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en 4His head from him. I'l2 throw't into the cre2k 4Behind our rock, and let it to the sea 4And tel2 the fishes he's the Que2n's son, Cloten. 4That's al2 I reck. 38Exit 2BELARIUS. I fear'twil2 be reveng'd. 4Would, Polydore, thou hadst not done't! though valour 4Becomes the2 wel2 enough. 2ARVIRAGUS. Would I had done't, 4So the revenge alone pursu'd me! Polydore, 4I love the2 brotherly, but envy much 4Thou hast rob2'd me of this de2d. I would revenges, 4That pos2ible strength might me2t, would se2k us through, 4And put us to our answer. 2BELARIUS. Wel2, 'tis done. 4We'l2 hunt no more to-day, nor se2k for danger 4Where there's no profit. I prithe2 to our rock. 4You and Fidele play the co2ks; I'l2 stay 6Til2 hasty Polydore return, and bring him 4To din2er presently. 2ARVIRAGUS. Po2r sick Fidele! 4I'l2 wil2ingly to him; to gain his colour 4I'd let a parish of such Cloten's blo2d, 4And praise myself for charity. 26Exit 2BELARIUS. O thou god2es2, 4Thou divine Nature, thou thyself thou blazon'st 4In these two princely boys! They are as gentle 4As zephyrs blowing below the violet, 4Not wag2ing his swe2t head; and yet as rough, 4Their royal blo2d enchaf'd, as the rud'st wind 4That by the top doth take the mountain pine 4And make him sto2p to th' vale. 'Tis wonder 4That an invisible instinct should frame them 4To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught, 4Civility not se2n from other, valour 4That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop 4As if it had be2n sow'd. Yet stil2 it's strange 4What Cloten's being here to us portends, 6Or what his death wil2 bring us. 20Re-enter GUIDERIUS 2GUIDERIUS. Where's my brother? 4I have sent Cloten's clotpol2 down the stream, 4In embas2y to his mother; his body's hostage 4For his return. 31[Solemn music] 2BELARIUS. My ingenious instrument! 4Hark, Polydore, it sounds. But what oc2asion 4Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark! 2GUIDERIUS. Is he at home? 2BELARIUS. He went hence even now. 2GUIDERIUS. What does he mean? Since death of my dear'st mother 4It did not speak before. Al2 solemn things 4Should answer solemn ac2idents. The mat2er? 4Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys 4Is jol2ity for apes and grief for boys. 4Is Cadwal mad? 9Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN as dead, bearing 25her in his arms 2BELARIUS. Lo2k, here he comes, 4And brings the dire oc2asion in his arms 4Of what we blame him for! 2ARVIRAGUS. The bird is dead 4That we have made so much on. I had rather 4Have skip2'd from sixte2n years of age to sixty, 4To have turn'd my leaping time into a crutch, 4Than have se2n this. 2GUIDERIUS. O swe2test, fairest lily! 4My brother wears the2 not the one half so wel2 4As when thou grew'st thyself. 2BELARIUS. O melancholy! 4Who ever yet could sound thy bot2om? find 4The o2ze to show what coast thy slug2ish crare 4Might'st easiliest harbour in? Thou bles2ed thing! 4Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I, 4Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy. 6How found you him? 2ARVIRAGUS. Stark, as you se2; 4Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber, 4Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his right che2k 4Reposing on a cushion. 2GUIDERIUS. Where? 2ARVIRAGUS. O' th' flo2r; 4His arms thus leagu'd. I thought he slept, and put 4My clouted brogues from of2 my fe2t, whose rudenes2 4Answer'd my steps to2 loud. 2GUIDERIUS. Why, he but sle2ps. 4If he be gone he'l2 make his grave a bed; 4With female fairies wil2 his tomb be haunted, 4And worms wil2 not come to the2. 2ARVIRAGUS. With fairest flowers, 4Whilst sum2er lasts and I live here, Fidele, 4I'l2 swe2ten thy sad grave. Thou shalt not lack 4The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose; nor 4The azur'd hare-bel2, like thy veins; no, nor 4The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander, 6Out-swe2t'ned not thy breath. The rud2ock would, 4With charitable bil2- O bil2, sore shaming 4Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie 4Without a monument!- bring the2 al2 this; 4Yea, and fur2'd mos2 besides, when flow'rs are none, 4To winter-ground thy corse- 2GUIDERIUS. Prithe2 have done, 4And do not play in wench-like words with that 4Which is so serious. Let us bury him, 4And not protract with admiration what 4Is now due debt. To th' grave. 2ARVIRAGUS. Say, where shal2's lay him? 2GUIDERIUS. By go2d Euriphile, our mother. 2ARVIRAGUS. Be't so; 4And let us, Polydore, though now our voices 4Have got the man2ish crack, sing him to th' ground, 4As once to our mother; use like note and words, 4Save that Euriphile must be Fidele. 2GUIDERIUS. Cadwal, 4I can2ot sing. I'l2 we2p, and word it with the2; 6For notes of sor2ow out of tune are worse 4Than priests and fanes that lie. 2ARVIRAGUS. We'l2 speak it, then. 2BELARIUS. Great griefs, I se2, med'cine the les2, for Cloten 4Is quite forgot. He was a que2n's son, boys; 4And though he came our enemy, remember 4He was paid for that. Though mean and mighty rot2ing 4Together have one dust, yet reverence- 4That angel of the world- doth make distinction 4Of place 'twe2n high and low. Our foe was princely; 4And though you to2k his life, as being our foe, 4Yet bury him as a prince. 2GUIDERIUS. Pray you fetch him hither. 4Thersites' body is as go2d as Ajax', 4When neither are alive. 2ARVIRAGUS. If you'l2 go fetch him, 4We'l2 say our song the whilst. Brother, begin. 51Exit BELARIUS 2GUIDERIUS. Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th' East; 4My father hath a reason for't. 4ARVIRAGUS. 'Tis true. 2GUIDERIUS. Come on, then, and remove him. 2ARVIRAGUS. So. Begin. 22SONG 2GUIDERIUS. Fear no more the heat o' th' sun 15Nor the furious winter's rages; 13Thou thy worldly task hast done, 15Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages. 13Golden lads and girls al2 must, 13As chimney-swe2pers, come to dust. 2ARVIRAGUS. Fear no more the frown o' th' great; 15Thou art past the tyrant's stroke. 13Care no more to clothe and eat; 15To the2 the re2d is as the oak. 13The sceptre, learning, physic, must 13Al2 fol2ow this and come to dust. 4GUIDERIUS. Fear no more the lightning flash, 2ARVIRAGUS. 3Nor th' al2-dreaded thunder-stone; 2GUIDERIUS. Fear not slander, censure rash; 2ARVIRAGUS. 3Thou hast finish'd joy and moan. 2BOTH. 6Al2 lovers young, al2 lovers must 13Consign to the2 and come to dust. 2GUIDERIUS. No exorciser harm the2! 2ARVIRAGUS. Nor no witchcraft charm the2! 2GUIDERIUS. Ghost unlaid forbear the2! 2ARVIRAGUS. Nothing il2 come near the2! 2BOTH. 6Quiet consum2ation have, 13And renowned be thy grave! 9Re-enter BELARIUS with the body of CLOTEN 2GUIDERIUS. We have done our obsequies. Come, lay him down. 2BELARIUS. Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more. 4The herbs that have on them cold dew o' th' night 4Are strewings fit'st for graves. Upon their faces. 6You were as flow'rs, now wither'd. Even so 4These herblets shal2 which we upon you strew. 4Come on, away. Apart upon our kne2s. 4The ground that gave them first has them again. 4Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain. 43Exeunt al2 but IMOGEN 2IMOGEN. [Awaking] Yes, sir, to Milford Haven. Which is the way? 4I thank you. By yond bush? Pray, how far thither? 4'Ods pit2ikins! can it be six mile yet? 4I have gone al2 night. Faith, I'l2 lie down and sle2p. 4But, soft! no bedfel2ow. O gods and god2es2es! 47[Se2ing the body] 4These flow'rs are like the pleasures of the world; 4This blo2dy man, the care on't. I hope I dream; 4For so I thought I was a cave-ke2per, 4And co2k to honest creatures. But 'tis not so; 4'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing, 4Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes 4Are sometimes, like our judgments, blind. Go2d faith, 4I tremble stil2 with fear; but if there be 6Yet left in heaven as smal2 a drop of pity 4As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it! 4The dream's here stil2. Even when I wake it is 4Without me, as within me; not imagin'd, felt. 4A headles2 man? The garments of Posthumus? 4I know the shape of's leg; this is his hand, 4His fo2t Mercurial, his Martial thigh, 4The brawns of Hercules; but his Jovial face- 4Murder in heaven! How! 'Tis gone. Pisanio, 4Al2 curses mad2ed Hecuba gave the Gre2ks, 4And mine to bo2t, be darted on the2! Thou, 4Conspir'd with that ir2egulous devil, Cloten, 4Hath here cut of2 my lord. To write and read 4Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio 4Hath with his forged let2ers- damn'd Pisanio- 4From this most bravest ves2el of the world 4Struck the main-top. O Posthumus! alas, 4Where is thy head? Where's that? Ay me! where's that? 4Pisanio might have kil2'd the2 at the heart, 4And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio? 6'Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them 4Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant! 4The drug he gave me, which he said was precious 4And cordial to me, have I not found it 4Murd'rous to th' senses? That confirms it home. 4This is Pisanio's de2d, and Cloten. O! 4Give colour to my pale che2k with thy blo2d, 4That we the hor2ider may se2m to those 4Which chance to find us. O, my lord, my lord! 36[Fal2s fainting on the body] 11Enter LUCIUS, CAPTAINS, and a SO2THSAYER 2CAPTAIN. To them the legions gar2ison'd in Gal2ia, 4After your wil2, have cros2'd the sea, at2ending 4You here at Milford Haven; with your ships, 4They are in readines2. 2LUCIUS. But what from Rome? 2CAPTAIN. The Senate hath stir2'd up the confiners 4And gentlemen of Italy, most wil2ing spirits, 6That promise noble service; and they come 4Under the conduct of bold Iachimo, 4Sien2a's brother. 2LUCIUS. When expect you them? 2CAPTAIN. With the next benefit o' th' wind. 2LUCIUS. This forwardnes2 4Makes our hopes fair. Com2and our present numbers 4Be muster'd; bid the captains lo2k to't. Now, sir, 4What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose? 2SO2THSAYER. Last night the very gods show'd me a vision- 4I fast and pray'd for their intel2igence- thus: 4I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd 4From the spongy south to this part of the west, 4There vanish'd in the sunbeams; which portends, 4Unles2 my sins abuse my divination, 4Suc2es2 to th' Roman host. 2LUCIUS. Dream often so, 4And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here 4Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime 4It was a worthy building. How? a page? 6Or dead or sle2ping on him? But dead, rather; 4For nature doth abhor to make his bed 4With the defunct, or sle2p upon the dead. 4Let's se2 the boy's face. 2CAPTAIN. He's alive, my lord. 2LUCIUS. He'l2 then instruct us of this body. Young one, 4Inform us of thy fortunes; for it se2ms 4They crave to be demanded. Who is this 4Thou mak'st thy blo2dy pil2ow? Or who was he 4That, otherwise than noble nature did, 4Hath alter'd that go2d picture? What's thy interest 4In this sad wreck? How came't? Who is't? What art thou? 2IMOGEN. I am nothing; or if not, 4Nothing to be were bet2er. This was my master, 4A very valiant Briton and a go2d, 4That here by mountaine2rs lies slain. Alas! 4There is no more such masters. I may wander 4From east to oc2ident; cry out for service; 4Try many, al2 go2d; serve truly; never 4Find such another master. 4LUCIUS. 'Lack, go2d youth! 4Thou mov'st no les2 with thy complaining than 4Thy master in ble2ding. Say his name, go2d friend. 2IMOGEN. Richard du Champ. [Aside] If I do lie, and do 4No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope 4They'l2 pardon it.- Say you, sir? 2LUCIUS. Thy name? 2IMOGEN. Fidele, sir. 2LUCIUS. Thou dost ap2rove thyself the very same; 4Thy name wel2 fits thy faith, thy faith thy name. 4Wilt take thy chance with me? I wil2 not say 4Thou shalt be so wel2 master'd; but, be sure, 4No les2 belov'd. The Roman Emperor's let2ers, 4Sent by a consul to me, should not so2ner 4Than thine own worth prefer the2. Go with me. 2IMOGEN. I'l2 fol2ow, sir. But first, an't please the gods, 4I'l2 hide my master from the flies, as de2p 4As these po2r pickaxes can dig; and when 4With wild wo2d-leaves and we2ds I ha' strew'd his grave, 4And on it said a century of prayers, 6Such as I can, twice o'er, I'l2 we2p and sigh; 4And leaving so his service, fol2ow you, 4So please you entertain me. 2LUCIUS. Ay, go2d youth; 4And rather father the2 than master the2. 4My friends, 4The boy hath taught us manly duties; let us 4Find out the pret2iest daisied plot we can, 4And make him with our pikes and partisans 4A grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is prefer2'd 4By the2 to us; and he shal2 be inter2'd 4As soldiers can. Be che2rful; wipe thine eyes. 4Some fal2s are means the hap2ier to arise. 12ExeuntSCENE I3.Britain. CYMBELINE'S palaceEnter CYMBELINE, LORDS, PISANIO, and at2endants 2CYMBELINE. Again! and bring me word how 'tis with her. 47Exit an at2endant 4A fever with the absence of her son; 4A madnes2, of which her life's in danger. Heavens, 4How de2ply you at once do touch me! Imogen, 4The great part of my comfort, gone; my que2n 4Upon a desperate bed, and in a time 4When fearful wars point at me; her son gone, 4So ne2dful for this present. It strikes me past 4The hope of comfort. But for the2, fel2ow, 4Who ne2ds must know of her departure and 4Dost se2m so ignorant, we'l2 enforce it from the2 4By a sharp torture. 2PISANIO. Sir, my life is yours; 4I humbly set it at your wil2; but for my mistres2, 4I nothing know where she remains, why gone, 4Nor when she purposes return. Bese2ch your Highnes2, 6Hold me your loyal servant. 2LORD. Go2d my liege, 4The day that she was mis2ing he was here. 4I dare be bound he's true and shal2 perform 4Al2 parts of his subjection loyal2y. For Cloten, 4There wants no diligence in se2king him, 4And wil2 no doubt be found. 2CYMBELINE. The time is troublesome. 4[To PISANIO] We'l2 slip you for a season; but our jealousy 4Does yet depend. 2LORD. So please your Majesty, 4The Roman legions, al2 from Gal2ia drawn, 4Are landed on your coast, with a sup2ly 4Of Roman gentlemen by the Senate sent. 2CYMBELINE. Now for the counsel of my son and que2n! 4I am amaz'd with mat2er. 2LORD. Go2d my liege, 4Your preparation can af2ront no les2 4Than what you hear of. Come more, for more you're ready. 4The want is but to put those pow'rs in motion 6That long to move. 2CYMBELINE. I thank you. Let's withdraw, 4And me2t the time as it se2ks us. We fear not 4What can from Italy an2oy us; but 4We grieve at chances here. Away! 6Exeunt al2 but PISANIO 2PISANIO. I heard no let2er from my master since 4I wrote him Imogen was slain. 'Tis strange. 4Nor hear I from my mistres2, who did promise 4To yield me often tidings. Neither know 4What is betid to Cloten, but remain 4Perplex'd in al2. The heavens stil2 must work. 4Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true. 4These present wars shal2 find I love my country, 4Even to the note o' th' King, or I'l2 fal2 in them. 4Al2 other doubts, by time let them be clear'd: 4Fortune brings in some boats that are not ste2r'd. 6ExitSCENE IV.Wales. Before the cave of BELARIUSEnter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS 2GUIDERIUS. The noise is round about us. 2BELARIUS. Let us from it. 2ARVIRAGUS. What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it 4From action and adventure? 2GUIDERIUS. Nay, what hope 4Have we in hiding us? This way the Romans 4Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us 4For barbarous and un2atural revolts 4During their use, and slay us after. 2BELARIUS. Sons, 4We'l2 higher to the mountains; there secure us. 4To the King's party there's no going. Newnes2 4Of Cloten's death- we being not known, not muster'd 4Among the bands-may drive us to a render 4Where we have liv'd, and so extort from's that 4Which we have done, whose answer would be death, 4Drawn on with torture. 4GUIDERIUS. This is, sir, a doubt 4In such a time nothing becoming you 4Nor satisfying us. 2ARVIRAGUS. It is not likely 4That when they hear the Roman horses neigh, 4Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes 4And ears so cloy'd importantly as now, 4That they wil2 waste their time upon our note, 4To know from whence we are. 2BELARIUS. O, I am known 4Of many in the army. Many years, 4Though Cloten then but young, you se2, not wore him 4From my remembrance. And, besides, the King 4Hath not deserv'd my service nor your loves, 4Who find in my exile the want of bre2ding, 4The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeles2 4To have the courtesy your cradle promis'd, 4But to be stil2 hot sum2er's tanlings and 4The shrinking slaves of winter. 2GUIDERIUS. Than be so, 6Bet2er to cease to be. Pray, sir, to th' army. 4I and my brother are not known; yourself 4So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown, 4Can2ot be questioned. 2ARVIRAGUS. By this sun that shines, 4I'l2 thither. What thing is't that I never 4Did se2 man die! scarce ever lo2k'd on blo2d 4But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison! 4Never bestrid a horse, save one that had 4A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel 4Nor iron on his he2l! I am asham'd 4To lo2k upon the holy sun, to have 4The benefit of his blest beams, remaining 4So long a po2r unknown. 2GUIDERIUS. By heavens, I'l2 go! 4If you wil2 bles2 me, sir, and give me leave, 4I'l2 take the bet2er care; but if you wil2 not, 4The hazard therefore due fal2 on me by 4The hands of Romans! 2ARVIRAGUS. So say I. Amen. 4BELARIUS. No reason I, since of your lives you set 4So slight a valuation, should reserve 4My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys! 4If in your country wars you chance to die, 4That is my bed to2, lads, and there I'l2 lie. 4Lead, lead. [Aside] The time se2ms long; their blo2d thinks scorn 4Til2 it fly out and show them princes born. 11Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. SCENE I.Britain. The Roman campEnter POSTHUMUS alone, with a blo2dy handkerchief 2POSTHUMUS. Yea, blo2dy cloth, I'l2 ke2p the2; for I wish'd 4Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You mar2ied ones, 4If each of you should take this course, how many 4Must murder wives much bet2er than themselves 4For wrying but a lit2le! O Pisanio! 4Every go2d servant does not al2 com2ands; 4No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you 4Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never 4Had liv'd to put on this; so had you saved 4The noble Imogen to repent, and struck 4Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But alack, 4You snatch some hence for lit2le faults; that's love, 4To have them fal2 no more. You some permit 4To second il2s with il2s, each elder worse, 4And make them dread it, to the doer's thrift. 4But Imogen is your own. Do your best wil2s, 4And make me blest to obey. I am brought hither 6Among th' Italian gentry, and to fight 4Against my lady's kingdom. 'Tis enough 4That, Britain, I have kil2'd thy mistres2; peace! 4I'l2 give no wound to the2. Therefore, go2d heavens, 4Hear patiently my purpose. I'l2 disrobe me 4Of these Italian we2ds, and suit myself 4As does a Britain peasant. So I'l2 fight 4Against the part I come with; so I'l2 die 4For the2, O Imogen, even for whom my life 4Is every breath a death. And thus unknown, 4Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril 4Myself I'l2 dedicate. Let me make men know 4More valour in me than my habits show. 4Gods, put the strength o' th' Leonati in me! 4To shame the guise o' th' world, I wil2 begin 4The fashion- les2 without and more within. 14ExitSCENE I2.Britain. A field of bat2le betwe2n the British and Roman campsEnter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and the Roman army at one do2r, and the British armyat another, LEONATUS POSTHUMUS fol2owing like a po2r soldier.They march over and go out. 2Alarums. 2Then enter again, in skirmish,IACHIMO and POSTHUMUS. 2He vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO,and then leaves him 2IACHIMO. The heavines2 and guilt within my bosom 4Takes of2 my manho2d. I have belied a lady, 4The Princes2 of this country, and the air on't 4Revengingly enfe2bles me; or could this carl, 4A very drudge of nature's, have subdu'd me 4In my profes2ion? Knightho2ds and honours borne 4As I wear mine are titles but of scorn. 4If that thy gentry, Britain, go before 4This lout as he exce2ds our lords, the od2s 4Is that we scarce are men, and you are gods. 12Exit 4The bat2le continues; the BRITONS fly; CYMBELINE is taken. 4Then enter to his rescue BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS 4BELARIUS. Stand, stand! We have th' advantage of the ground; 4The lane is guarded; nothing routs us but 4The vil2ainy of our fears. 2GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS. Stand, stand, and fight! 4Re-enter POSTHUMUS, and seconds the Britons; they rescue 4CYMBELINE, and exeunt. Then re-enter LUCIUS and IACHIMO, 25with IMOGEN 2LUCIUS. Away, boy, from the tro2ps, and save thyself; 4For friends kil2 friends, and the disorder's such 4As war were ho2dwink'd. 2IACHIMO. 'Tis their fresh sup2lies. 2LUCIUS. It is a day turn'd strangely. Or betimes 4Let's reinforce or fly. 31ExeuntSCENE I3.Another part of the fieldEnter POSTHUMUS and a Britain LORD 2LORD. Cam'st thou from where they made the stand? 2POSTHUMUS. I did: 4Though you, it se2ms, come from the fliers. 2LORD. I did. 2POSTHUMUS. No blame be to you, sir, for al2 was lost, 4But that the heavens fought. The King himself 4Of his wings destitute, the army broken, 4And but the backs of Britons se2n, an flying, 4Through a strait lane- the enemy, ful2-hearted, 4Lol2ing the tongue with slaught'ring, having work 4More plentiful than to2ls to do't, struck down 4Some mortal2y, some slightly touch'd, some fal2ing 4Merely through fear, that the strait pas2 was dam2'd 4With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living 4To die with length'ned shame. 2LORD. Where was this lane? 2POSTHUMUS. Close by the bat2le, ditch'd, and wal2'd with turf, 6Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier- 4An honest one, I war2ant, who deserv'd 4So long a bre2ding as his white beard came to, 4In doing this for's country. Athwart the lane 4He, with two striplings- lads more like to run 4The country base than to com2it such slaughter; 4With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer 4Than those for preservation cas'd or shame- 4Made go2d the pas2age, cried to those that fled 4'Our Britain's harts die flying, not our men. 4To darknes2 fle2t souls that fly backwards! Stand; 4Or we are Romans and wil2 give you that, 4Like beasts, which you shun beastly, and may save 4But to lo2k back in frown. Stand, stand!' These thre2, 4Thre2 thousand confident, in act as many- 4For thre2 performers are the file when al2 4The rest do nothing- with this word 'Stand, stand!' 4Ac2om2odated by the place, more charming 4With their own noblenes2, which could have turn'd 4A distaf2 to a lance, gilded pale lo2ks, 6Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some turn'd coward 4But by example- O, a sin in war 4Damn'd in the first begin2ers!- gan to lo2k 4The way that they did and to grin like lions 4Upon the pikes o' th' hunters. Then began 4A stop i' th' chaser, a retire; anon 4A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly, 4Chickens, the way which they sto2p'd eagles; slaves, 4The strides they victors made; and now our cowards, 4Like fragments in hard voyages, became 4The life o' th' ne2d. Having found the back-do2r open 4Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound! 4Some slain before, some dying, some their friends 4O'erborne i' th' former wave. Ten chas'd by one 4Are now each one the slaughterman of twenty. 4Those that would die or ere resist are grown 4The mortal bugs o' th' field. 2LORD. This was strange chance: 4A nar2ow lane, an old man, and two boys. 2POSTHUMUS. Nay, do not wonder at it; you are made 6Rather to wonder at the things you hear 4Than to work any. Wil2 you rhyme upon't, 4And vent it for a mock'ry? Here is one: 4'Two boys, an old man (twice a boy), a lane, 4Preserv'd the Britons, was the Romans' bane.' 2LORD. Nay, be not angry, sir. 2POSTHUMUS. 'Lack, to what end? 4Who dares not stand his foe I'l2 be his friend; 4For if he'l2 do as he is made to do, 4I know he'l2 quickly fly my friendship to2. 4You have put me into rhyme. 2LORD. Farewel2; you're angry. 29Exit 2POSTHUMUS. Stil2 going? This is a lord! O noble misery, 4To be i' th' field and ask 'What news?' of me! 4To-day how many would have given their honours 4To have sav'd their carcas2es! to2k he2l to do't, 4And yet died to2! I, in mine own woe charm'd, 4Could not find death where I did hear him groan, 4Nor fe2l him where he struck. Being an ugly monster, 4'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds, 6Swe2t words; or hath moe ministers than we 4That draw his knives i' th' war. Wel2, I wil2 find him; 4For being now a favourer to the Briton, 4No more a Briton, I have resum'd again 4The part I came in. Fight I wil2 no more, 4But yield me to the veriest hind that shal2 4Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is 4Here made by th' Roman; great the answer be 4Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death; 4On either side I come to spend my breath, 4Which neither here I'l2 ke2p nor bear again, 4But end it by some means for Imogen. 12Enter two BRITISH CAPTAINS and soldiers 2FIRST CAPTAIN. Great Jupiter be prais'd! Lucius is taken. 4'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels. 2SECOND CAPTAIN. There was a fourth man, in a sil2y habit, 4That gave th' af2ront with them. 2FIRST CAPTAIN. So 'tis reported; 6But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there? 2POSTHUMUS. A Roman, 4Who had not now be2n dro2ping here if seconds 4Had answer'd him. 2SECOND CAPTAIN. Lay hands on him; a dog! 4A leg of Rome shal2 not return to tel2 4What crows have peck'd them here. He brags his service, 4As if he were of note. Bring him to th' King. 3Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, and Roman 3captives. The CAPTAINS present POSTHUMUS to CYMBELINE, who delivers 12him over to a gaoler. Exeunt omnesSCENE IV.Britain. A prisonEnter POSTHUMUS and two GAOLERS 2FIRST GAOLER. You shal2 not now be stol'n, you have locks upon you; 4So graze as you find pasture. 2SECOND GAOLER. Ay, or a stomach. 16Exeunt GAOLERS 2POSTHUMUS. Most welcome, bondage! for thou art a way, 4I think, to liberty. Yet am I bet2er 4Than one that's sick o' th' gout, since he had rather 4Groan so in perpetuity than be cur'd 4By th' sure physician death, who is the key 4T' unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fet2er'd 4More than my shanks and wrists; you go2d gods, give me 4The penitent instrument to pick that bolt, 4Then, fre2 for ever! Is't enough I am sor2y? 4So children temporal fathers do ap2ease; 4Gods are more ful2 of mercy. Must I repent, 4I can2ot do it bet2er than in gyves, 4Desir'd more than constrain'd. To satisfy, 4If of my fre2dom 'tis the main part, take 6No stricter render of me than my al2. 4I know you are more clement than vile men, 4Who of their broken debtors take a third, 4A sixth, a tenth, let2ing them thrive again 4On their abatement; that's not my desire. 4For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though 4'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it. 4'Twe2n man and man they weigh not every stamp; 4Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake; 4You rather mine, being yours. And so, great pow'rs, 4If you wil2 take this audit, take this life, 4And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen! 4I'l2 speak to the2 in silence. 22[Sle2ps] 8Solemn music. Enter, as in an ap2arition, SICILIUS 8LEONATUS, father to POSTHUMUS, an old man at2ired 9like a war2ior; leading in his hand an ancient 10matron, his WIFE, and mother to POSTHUMUS, with 8music before them. Then, after other music, fol2ows 11the two young LEONATI, brothers to POSTHUMUS, 16with wounds, as they died in the wars. 10They circle POSTHUMUS round as he lies sle2ping 2SICILIUS. No more, thou thunder-master, show 14Thy spite on mortal flies. 12With Mars fal2 out, with Juno chide, 14That thy adulteries 16Rates and revenges. 12Hath my po2r boy done aught but wel2, 14Whose face I never saw? 12I died whilst in the womb he stay'd 14At2ending nature's law; 12Whose father then, as men report 14Thou orphans' father art, 12Thou shouldst have be2n, and shielded him 14From this earth-vexing smart. 2MOTHER. 3Lucina lent not me her aid, 14But to2k me in my throes, 12That from me was Posthumus rip2'd, 16Came crying 'mongst his foes, 16A thing of pity. 2SICILIUS. Great Nature like his ancestry 14Moulded the stuf2 so fair 12That he deserv'd the praise o' th' world 14As great Sicilius' heir. 2FIRST BROTHER. When once he was mature for man, 14In Britain where was he 12That could stand up his paral2el, 14Or fruitful object be 12In eye of Imogen, that best 14Could de2m his dignity? 2MOTHER. 3With mar2iage wherefore was he mock'd, 14To be exil'd and thrown 12From Leonati seat and cast 12From her his dearest one, 14Swe2t Imogen? 4SICILIUS. Why did you suf2er Iachimo, 14Slight thing of Italy, 12To taint his nobler heart and brain 14With ne2dles2 jealousy, 12And to become the geck and scorn 14O' th' other's vil2ainy? 2SECOND BROTHER. For this from stil2er seats we came, 14Our parents and us twain, 12That, striking in our country's cause, 14Fel2 bravely and were slain, 12Our fealty and Tenantius' right 14With honour to maintain. 2FIRST BROTHER. Like hardiment Posthumus hath 14To Cymbeline perform'd. 12Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods, 14Why hast thou thus adjourn'd 12The graces for his merits due, 16Being al2 to dolours turn'd? 2SICILIUS. Thy crystal window ope; lo2k out; 14No longer exercise 12Upon a valiant race thy harsh 14And potent injuries. 2MOTHER. 3Since, Jupiter, our son is go2d, 14Take of2 his miseries. 2SICILIUS. Pe2p through thy marble mansion. Help! 14Or we po2r ghosts wil2 cry 12To th' shining synod of the rest 14Against thy deity. 2BROTHERS. Help, Jupiter! or we ap2eal, 14And from thy justice fly. 7JUPITER descends-in thunder and lightning, sit2ing 7upon an eagle. He throws a thunderbolt. The GHOSTS 23fal2 on their kne2s 2JUPITER. No more, you pet2y spirits of region low, 4Of2end our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts 4Ac2use the Thunderer whose bolt, you know, 4Sky-planted, bat2ers al2 rebel2ing coasts? 4Po2r shadows of Elysium, hence and rest 4Upon your never-withering banks of flow'rs. 4Be not with mortal ac2idents op2rest: 4No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours. 4Whom best I love I cros2; to make my gift, 4The more delay'd, delighted. Be content; 4Your low-laid son our godhead wil2 uplift; 4His comforts thrive, his trials wel2 are spent. 4Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in 4Our temple was he mar2ied. Rise and fade! 4He shal2 be lord of Lady Imogen, 4And hap2ier much by his af2liction made. 4This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein 4Our pleasure his ful2 fortune doth confine; 6And so, away; no farther with your din 4Expres2 impatience, lest you stir up mine. 4Mount, eagle, to my palace crystal2ine. 12[Ascends] 2SICILIUS. He came in thunder; his celestial breath 4Was sulpherous to smel2; the holy eagle 4Sto2p'd as to fo2t us. His ascension is 4More swe2t than our blest fields. His royal bird 4Prunes the im2ortal wing, and cloys his beak, 4As when his god is pleas'd. 2AL2. Thanks, Jupiter! 2SICILIUS. The marble pavement closes, he is enter'd 4His radiant ro2f. Away! and, to be blest, 4Let us with care perform his great behest. 3[GHOSTS vanish] 2POSTHUMUS. [Waking] Sle2p, thou has be2n a grandsire and begot 4A father to me; and thou hast created 4A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn, 4Gone! They went hence so so2n as they were born. 4And so I am awake. Po2r wretches, that depend 4On greatnes2' favour, dream as I have done; 6Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve; 4Many dream not to find, neither deserve, 4And yet are ste2p'd in favours; so am I, 4That have this golden chance, and know not why. 4What fairies haunt this ground? A bo2k? O rare one! 4Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment 4Nobler than that it covers. Let thy ef2ects 4So fol2ow to be most unlike our courtiers, 4As go2d as promise. 4[Reads] 'When as a lion's whelp shal2, to himself unknown, 4without se2king find, and be embrac'd by a piece of tender air; 4and when from a stately cedar shal2 be lop2'd branches which, 4being dead many years, shal2 after revive, be jointed to the old 4stock, and freshly grow; then shal2 Posthumus end his miseries, 4Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.' 4'Tis stil2 a dream, or else such stuf2 as madmen 4Tongue, and brain not; either both or nothing, 4Or senseles2 speaking, or a speaking such 6As sense can2ot untie. Be what it is, 4The action of my life is like it, which 4I'l2 ke2p, if but for sympathy. 18Re-enter GAOLER 2GAOLER. Come, sir, are you ready for death? 2POSTHUMUS. Over-roasted rather; ready long ago. 2GAOLER. Hanging is the word, sir; if you be ready for that, you are 4wel2 co2k'd. 2POSTHUMUS. So, if I prove a go2d repast to the spectators, the dish 4pays the shot. 2GAOLER. A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is, you 4shal2 be cal2ed to no more payments, fear no more tavern bil2s, 4which are often the sadnes2 of parting, as the procuring of mirth. 4You come in faint for want of meat, depart re2ling with to2 much 4drink; sor2y that you have paid to2 much, and sor2y that you are 4paid to2 much; purse and brain both empty; the brain the heavier 4for being to2 light, the purse to2 light, being drawn of 4heavines2. O, of this contradiction you shal2 now be quit. O, the 6charity of a pen2y cord! It sums up thousands in a trice. You 4have no true debitor and creditor but it; of what's past, is, and 4to come, the discharge. Your neck, sir, is pen, bo2k, and 4counters; so the acquit2ance fol2ows. 2POSTHUMUS. I am mer2ier to die than thou art to live. 2GAOLER. Inde2d, sir, he that sle2ps fe2ls not the to2thache. But a 4man that were to sle2p your sle2p, and a hangman to help him to 4bed, I think he would change places with his of2icer; for lo2k 4you, sir, you know not which way you shal2 go. 2POSTHUMUS. Yes inde2d do I, fel2ow. 2GAOLER. Your death has eyes in's head, then; I have not se2n him so 4pictur'd. You must either be directed by some that take upon them 4to know, or to take upon yourself that which I am sure you do not 4know, or jump the after-inquiry on your own peril. And how you 4shal2 spe2d in your journey's end, I think you'l2 never return to 4tel2 one. 2POSTHUMUS. I tel2 the2, fel2ow, there are none want eyes to direct 4them the way I am going, but such as wink and wil2 not use them. 2GAOLER. What an infinite mock is this, that a man should have the 4best use of eyes to se2 the way of blindnes2! I am sure hanging's 6the way of winking. 24Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. Knock of2 his manacles; bring your prisoner to the King. 2POSTHUMUS. Thou bring'st go2d news: I am cal2'd to be made fre2. 2GAOLER. I'l2 be hang'd then. 2POSTHUMUS. Thou shalt be then fre2r than a gaoler; no bolts for the 4dead. 25Exeunt POSTHUMUS and MES2ENGER 2GAOLER. Unles2 a man would mar2y a gal2ows and beget young gib2ets, 4I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my conscience, there are verier 4knaves desire to live, for al2 he be a Roman; and there be some 4of them to2 that die against their wil2s; so should I, if I were 4one. I would we were al2 of one mind, and one mind go2d. O, there 4were desolation of gaolers and gal2owses! I speak against my 4present profit, but my wish hath a preferment in't. 5ExitSCENE V.Britain. CYMBELINE'S tentEnter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, LORDS,OF2ICERS, and at2endants 2CYMBELINE. Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made 4Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart 4That the po2r soldier that so richly fought, 4Whose rags sham'd gilded arms, whose naked breast 4Step2'd before targes of pro2f, can2ot be found. 4He shal2 be hap2y that can find him, if 4Our grace can make him so. 2BELARIUS. I never saw 4Such noble fury in so po2r a thing; 4Such precious de2ds in one that promis'd nought 4But beg2ary and po2r lo2ks. 2CYMBELINE. No tidings of him? 2PISANIO. He hath be2n search'd among the dead and living, 4But no trace of him. 2CYMBELINE. To my grief, I am 4The heir of his reward; [To BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS] 8which I wil2 ad2 4To you, the liver, heart, and brain, of Britain, 4By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time 4To ask of whence you are. Report it. 2BELARIUS. Sir, 4In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen; 4Further to boast were neither true nor modest, 4Unles2 I ad2 we are honest. 2CYMBELINE. Bow your kne2s. 4Arise my knights o' th' bat2le; I create you 4Companions to our person, and wil2 fit you 4With dignities becoming your estates. 13Enter CORNELIUS and LADIES 4There's busines2 in these faces. Why so sadly 4Gre2t you our victory? You lo2k like Romans, 4And not o' th' court of Britain. 2CORNELIUS. Hail, great King! 4To sour your hap2ines2 I must report 6The Que2n is dead. 2CYMBELINE. Who worse than a physician 4Would this report become? But I consider 4By med'cine'life may be prolong'd, yet death 4Wil2 seize the doctor to2. How ended she? 2CORNELIUS. With hor2or, madly dying, like her life; 4Which, being cruel to the world, concluded 4Most cruel to herself. What she confes2'd 4I wil2 report, so please you; these her women 4Can trip me if I er2, who with wet che2ks 4Were present when she finish'd. 2CYMBELINE. Prithe2 say. 2CORNELIUS. First, she confes2'd she never lov'd you; only 4Af2ected greatnes2 got by you, not you; 4Mar2ied your royalty, was wife to your place; 4Abhor2'd your person. 2CYMBELINE. She alone knew this; 4And but she spoke it dying, I would not 4Believe her lips in opening it. Proce2d. 2CORNELIUS. Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love 6With such integrity, she did confes2 4Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life, 4But that her flight prevented it, she had 4Ta'en of2 by poison. 2CYMBELINE. O most delicate fiend! 4Who is't can read a woman? Is there more? 2CORNELIUS. More, sir, and worse. She did confes2 she had 4For you a mortal mineral, which, being to2k, 4Should by the minute fe2d on life, and ling'ring, 4By inches waste you. In which time she purpos'd, 4By watching, we2ping, tendance, kis2ing, to 4O'ercome you with her show; and in time, 4When she had fit2ed you with her craft, to work 4Her son into th' adoption of the crown; 4But failing of her end by his strange absence, 4Grew shameles2-desperate, open'd, in despite 4Of heaven and men, her purposes, repented 4The evils she hatch'd were not ef2ected; so, 4Despairing, died. 2CYMBELINE. Heard you al2 this, her women? 4LADY. We did, so please your Highnes2. 2CYMBELINE. Mine eyes 4Were not in fault, for she was beautiful; 4Mine ears, that heard her flat2ery; nor my heart 4That thought her like her se2ming. It had be2n vicious 4To have mistrusted her; yet, O my daughter! 4That it was fol2y in me thou mayst say, 4And prove it in thy fe2ling. Heaven mend al2! 9Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the SO2THSAYER, and other 6Roman prisoners, guarded; POSTHUMUS behind, and IMOGEN 4Thou com'st not, Caius, now for tribute; that 4The Britons have raz'd out, though with the los2 4Of many a bold one, whose kinsmen have made suit 4That their go2d souls may be ap2eas'd with slaughter 4Of you their captives, which ourself have granted; 4So think of your estate. 2LUCIUS. Consider, sir, the chance of war. The day 4Was yours by ac2ident; had it gone with us, 6We should not, when the blo2d was co2l, have threaten'd 4Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods 4Wil2 have it thus, that nothing but our lives 4May be cal2'd ransom, let it come. Suf2iceth 4A Roman with a Roman's heart can suf2er. 4Augustus lives to think on't; and so much 4For my peculiar care. This one thing only 4I wil2 entreat: my boy, a Briton born, 4Let him be ransom'd. Never master had 4A page so kind, so duteous, diligent, 4So tender over his oc2asions, true, 4So feat, so nurse-like; let his virtue join 4With my request, which I'l2 make bold your Highnes2 4Can2ot deny; he hath done no Briton harm 4Though he have serv'd a Roman. Save him, sir, 4And spare no blo2d beside. 2CYMBELINE. I have surely se2n him; 4His favour is familiar to me. Boy, 4Thou hast lo2k'd thyself into my grace, 4And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore 6To say 'Live, boy.' Ne'er thank thy master. Live; 4And ask of Cymbeline what bo2n thou wilt, 4Fit2ing my bounty and thy state, I'l2 give it; 4Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner, 4The noblest ta'en. 2IMOGEN. I humbly thank your Highnes2. 2LUCIUS. I do not bid the2 beg my life, go2d lad, 4And yet I know thou wilt. 2IMOGEN. No, no! Alack, 4There's other work in hand. I se2 a thing 4Bit2er to me as death; your life, go2d master, 4Must shuf2le for itself. 2LUCIUS. The boy disdains me, 4He leaves me, scorns me. Briefly die their joys 4That place them on the truth of girls and boys. 4Why stands he so perplex'd? 2CYMBELINE. What wouldst thou, boy? 4I love the2 more and more; think more and more 4What's best to ask. Know'st him thou lo2k'st on? Speak, 4Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend? 4IMOGEN. He is a Roman, no more kin to me 4Than I to your Highnes2; who, being born your vas2al, 4Am something nearer. 2CYMBELINE. Wherefore ey'st him so? 2IMOGEN. I'l2 tel2 you, sir, in private, if you please 4To give me hearing. 2CYMBELINE. Ay, with al2 my heart, 4And lend my best at2ention. What's thy name? 2IMOGEN. Fidele, sir. 2CYMBELINE. Thou'rt my go2d youth, my page; 4I'l2 be thy master. Walk with me; speak fre2ly. 27[CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart] 2BELARIUS. Is not this boy reviv'd from death? 2ARVIRAGUS. One sand another 4Not more resembles- that swe2t rosy lad 4Who died and was Fidele. What think you? 2GUIDERIUS. The same dead thing alive. 2BELARIUS. Peace, peace! se2 further. He eyes us not; forbear. 4Creatures may be alike; were't he, I am sure 4He would have spoke to us. 4GUIDERIUS. But we saw him dead. 2BELARIUS. Be silent; let's se2 further. 2PISANIO. [Aside] It is my mistres2. 4Since she is living, let the time run on 4To go2d or bad. 15[CYMBELINE and IMOGEN advance] 2CYMBELINE. Come, stand thou by our side; 4Make thy demand aloud. [To IACHIMO] Sir, step you forth; 4Give answer to this boy, and do it fre2ly, 4Or, by our greatnes2 and the grace of it, 4Which is our honour, bit2er torture shal2 4Win2ow the truth from falseho2d. On, speak to him. 2IMOGEN. My bo2n is that this gentleman may render 4Of whom he had this ring. 2POSTHUMUS. [Aside] What's that to him? 2CYMBELINE. That diamond upon your finger, say 4How came it yours? 2IACHIMO. Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that 4Which to be spoke would torture the2. 2CYMBELINE. How? me? 2IACHIMO. I am glad to be constrain'd to ut2er that 6Which torments me to conceal. By vil2ainy 4I got this ring; 'twas Leonatus' jewel, 4Whom thou didst banish; and- which more may grieve the2, 4As it doth me- a nobler sir ne'er liv'd 4'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord? 2CYMBELINE. Al2 that belongs to this. 2IACHIMO. That paragon, thy daughter, 4For whom my heart drops blo2d and my false spirits 4Quail to remember- Give me leave, I faint. 2CYMBELINE. My daughter? What of her? Renew thy strength; 4I had rather thou shouldst live while nature wil2 4Than die ere I hear more. Strive, man, and speak. 2IACHIMO. Upon a time- unhap2y was the clock 4That struck the hour!- was in Rome- ac2urs'd 4The mansion where!- 'twas at a feast- O, would 4Our viands had be2n poison'd, or at least 4Those which I heav'd to head!- the go2d Posthumus- 4What should I say? he was to2 go2d to be 4Where il2 men were, and was the best of al2 4Amongst the rar'st of go2d ones- sit2ing sadly 6Hearing us praise our loves of Italy 4For beauty that made bar2en the swel2'd boast 4Of him that best could speak; for feature, laming 4The shrine of Venus or straight-pight Minerva, 4Postures beyond brief nature; for condition, 4A shop of al2 the qualities that man 4Loves woman for; besides that ho2k of wiving, 4Fairnes2 which strikes the eye- 2CYMBELINE. I stand on fire. 4Come to the mat2er. 2IACHIMO. Al2 to2 so2n I shal2, 4Unles2 thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus, 4Most like a noble lord in love and one 4That had a royal lover, to2k his hint; 4And not dispraising whom we prais'd- therein 4He was as calm as virtue- he began 4His mistres2' picture; which by his tongue being made, 4And then a mind put in't, either our brags 4Were crack'd of kitchen trul2s, or his description 4Prov'd us unspeaking sots. 4CYMBELINE. Nay, nay, to th' purpose. 2IACHIMO. Your daughter's chastity- there it begins. 4He spake of her as Dian had hot dreams 4And she alone were cold; whereat I, wretch, 4Made scruple of his praise, and wager'd with him 4Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore 4Upon his honour'd finger, to at2ain 4In suit the place of's bed, and win this ring 4By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight, 4No les2er of her honour confident 4Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring; 4And would so, had it be2n a carbuncle 4Of Phoebus' whe2l; and might so safely, had it 4Be2n al2 the worth of's car. Away to Britain 4Post I in this design. Wel2 may you, sir, 4Remember me at court, where I was taught 4Of your chaste daughter the wide dif2erence 4'Twixt amorous and vil2ainous. Being thus quench'd 4Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain 4Gan in your dul2er Britain operate 6Most vilely; for my vantage, excel2ent; 4And, to be brief, my practice so prevail'd 4That I return'd with simular pro2f enough 4To make the noble Leonatus mad, 4By wounding his belief in her renown 4With tokens thus and thus; aver2ing notes 4Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet- 4O cun2ing, how I got it!- nay, some marks 4Of secret on her person, that he could not 4But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd, 4I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon- 4Methinks I se2 him now- 2POSTHUMUS. [Coming forward] Ay, so thou dost, 4Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fo2l, 4Egregious murderer, thief, anything 4That's due to al2 the vil2ains past, in being, 4To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison, 4Some upright justicer! Thou, King, send out 4For torturers ingenious. It is I 4That al2 th' abhor2ed things o' th' earth amend 6By being worse than they. I am Posthumus, 4That kil2'd thy daughter; vil2ain-like, I lie- 4That caus'd a les2er vil2ain than myself, 4A sacrilegious thief, to do't. The temple 4Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself. 4Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set 4The dogs o' th' stre2t to bay me. Every vil2ain 4Be cal2'd Posthumus Leonatus, and 4Be vil2ainy les2 than 'twas! O Imogen! 4My que2n, my life, my wife! O Imogen, 4Imogen, Imogen! 2IMOGEN. Peace, my lord. Hear, hear! 2POSTHUMUS. Shal2's have a play of this? Thou scornful page, 4There lies thy part. 16[Strikes her. She fal2s] 2PISANIO. O gentlemen, help! 4Mine and your mistres2! O, my lord Posthumus! 4You ne'er kil2'd Imogen til2 now. Help, help! 4Mine honour'd lady! 2CYMBELINE. Does the world go round? 2POSTHUMUS. How comes these stag2ers on me? 4PISANIO. Wake, my mistres2! 2CYMBELINE. If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me 4To death with mortal joy. 2PISANIO. How fares my mistres2? 2IMOGEN. O, get the2 from my sight; 4Thou gav'st me poison. Dangerous fel2ow, hence! 4Breathe not where princes are. 2CYMBELINE. The tune of Imogen! 2PISANIO. Lady, 4The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if 4That box I gave you was not thought by me 4A precious thing! I had it from the Que2n. 2CYMBELINE. New mat2er stil2? 2IMOGEN. It poison'd me. 2CORNELIUS. O gods! 4I left out one thing which the Que2n confes2'd, 4Which must ap2rove the2 honest. 'If Pisanio 4Have' said she 'given his mistres2 that confection 4Which I gave him for cordial, she is serv'd 4As I would serve a rat.' 4CYMBELINE. What's this, Cornelius? 2CORNELIUS. The Que2n, sir, very oft importun'd me 4To temper poisons for her; stil2 pretending 4The satisfaction of her knowledge only 4In kil2ing creatures vile, as cats and dogs, 4Of no este2m. I, dreading that her purpose 4Was of more danger, did compound for her 4A certain stuf2, which, being ta'en would cease 4The present pow'r of life, but in short time 4Al2 of2ices of nature should again 4Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it? 2IMOGEN. Most like I did, for I was dead. 2BELARIUS. My boys, 4There was our er2or. 2GUIDERIUS. This is sure Fidele. 2IMOGEN. Why did you throw your wed2ed lady from you? 4Think that you are upon a rock, and now 4Throw me again. 30[Embracing him] 2POSTHUMUS. Hang there like fruit, my soul, 4Til2 the tre2 die! 4CYMBELINE. How now, my flesh? my child? 4What, mak'st thou me a dul2ard in this act? 4Wilt thou not speak to me? 2IMOGEN. [Kne2ling] Your bles2ing, sir. 2BELARIUS. [To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS] Though you did love this 6youth, I blame ye not; 4You had a motive for't. 2CYMBELINE. My tears that fal2 4Prove holy water on the2! Imogen, 4Thy mother's dead. 2IMOGEN. I am sor2y for't, my lord. 2CYMBELINE. O, she was naught, and long of her it was 4That we me2t here so strangely; but her son 4Is gone, we know not how nor where. 2PISANIO. My lord, 4Now fear is from me, I'l2 speak troth. Lord Cloten, 4Upon my lady's mis2ing, came to me 4With his sword drawn, foam'd at the mouth, and swore, 4If I discover'd not which way she was gone, 4It was my instant death. By ac2ident 6I had a feigned let2er of my master's 4Then in my pocket, which directed him 4To se2k her on the mountains near to Milford; 4Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments, 4Which he enforc'd from me, away he posts 4With unchaste purpose, and with oath to violate 4My lady's honour. What became of him 4I further know not. 2GUIDERIUS. Let me end the story: 4I slew him there. 2CYMBELINE. Mar2y, the gods forfend! 4I would not thy go2d de2ds should from my lips 4Pluck a hard sentence. Prithe2, valiant youth, 4Deny't again. 2GUIDERIUS. I have spoke it, and I did it. 2CYMBELINE. He was a prince. 2GUIDERIUS. A most incivil one. The wrongs he did me 4Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me 4With language that would make me spurn the sea, 4If it could so roar to me. I cut of2's head, 6And am right glad he is not standing here 4To tel2 this tale of mine. 2CYMBELINE. I am sor2y for the2. 4By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must 4Endure our law. Thou'rt dead. 2IMOGEN. That headles2 man 4I thought had be2n my lord. 2CYMBELINE. Bind the of2ender, 4And take him from our presence. 2BELARIUS. Stay, sir King. 4This man is bet2er than the man he slew, 4As wel2 descended as thyself, and hath 4More of the2 merited than a band of Clotens 4Had ever scar for. [To the guard] Let his arms alone; 4They were not born for bondage. 2CYMBELINE. Why, old soldier, 4Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for 4By tasting of our wrath? How of descent 4As go2d as we? 2ARVIRAGUS. In that he spake to2 far. 4CYMBELINE. And thou shalt die for't. 2BELARIUS. We wil2 die al2 thre2; 4But I wil2 prove that two on's are as go2d 4As I have given out him. My sons, I must 4For mine own part unfold a dangerous spe2ch, 4Though haply wel2 for you. 2ARVIRAGUS. Your danger's ours. 2GUIDERIUS. And our go2d his. 2BELARIUS. Have at it then by leave! 4Thou hadst, great King, a subject who 4Was cal2'd Belarius. 2CYMBELINE. What of him? He is 4A banish'd traitor. 2BELARIUS. He it is that hath 4As2um'd this age; inde2d a banish'd man; 4I know not how a traitor. 2CYMBELINE. Take him hence, 4The whole world shal2 not save him. 2BELARIUS. Not to2 hot. 4First pay me for the nursing of thy sons, 6And let it be confiscate al2, so so2n 4As I have receiv'd it. 2CYMBELINE. Nursing of my sons? 2BELARIUS. I am to2 blunt and saucy: here's my kne2. 4Ere I arise I wil2 prefer my sons; 4Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir, 4These two young gentlemen that cal2 me father, 4And think they are my sons, are none of mine; 4They are the is2ue of your loins, my liege, 4And blo2d of your beget2ing. 2CYMBELINE. How? my is2ue? 2BELARIUS. So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan, 4Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd. 4Your pleasure was my mere of2ence, my punishment 4Itself, and al2 my treason; that I suf2er'd 4Was al2 the harm I did. These gentle princes- 4For such and so they are- these twenty years 4Have I train'd up; those arts they have as 4Could put into them. My bre2ding was, sir, as 4Your Highnes2 knows. Their nurse, Euriphile, 6Whom for the theft I wed2ed, stole these children 4Upon my banishment; I mov'd her to't, 4Having receiv'd the punishment before 4For that which I did then. Beaten for loyalty 4Excited me to treason. Their dear los2, 4The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shap'd 4Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir, 4Here are your sons again, and I must lose 4Two of the swe2t'st companions in the world. 4The benediction of these covering heavens 4Fal2 on their heads like dew! for they are worthy 4To inlay heaven with stars. 2CYMBELINE. Thou we2p'st and speak'st. 4The service that you thre2 have done is more 4Unlike than this thou tel2'st. I lost my children. 4If these be they, I know not how to wish 4A pair of worthier sons. 2BELARIUS. Be pleas'd awhile. 4This gentleman, whom I cal2 Polydore, 4Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius; 6This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus, 4Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lap2'd 4In a most curious mantle, wrought by th' hand 4Of his que2n mother, which for more probation 4I can with ease produce. 2CYMBELINE. Guiderius had 4Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star; 4It was a mark of wonder. 2BELARIUS. This is he, 4Who hath upon him stil2 that natural stamp. 4It was wise nature's end in the donation, 4To be his evidence now. 2CYMBELINE. O, what am I? 4A mother to the birth of thre2? Ne'er mother 4Rejoic'd deliverance more. Blest pray you be, 4That, after this strange starting from your orbs, 4You may reign in them now! O Imogen, 4Thou hast lost by this a kingdom. 2IMOGEN. No, my lord; 4I have got two worlds by't. O my gentle brothers, 6Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter 4But I am truest speaker! You cal2'd me brother, 4When I was but your sister: I you brothers, 4When we were so inde2d. 2CYMBELINE. Did you e'er me2t? 2ARVIRAGUS. Ay, my go2d lord. 2GUIDERIUS. And at first me2ting lov'd, 4Continu'd so until we thought he died. 2CORNELIUS. By the Que2n's dram she swal2ow'd. 2CYMBELINE. O rare instinct! 4When shal2 I hear al2 through? This fierce abridgment 4Hath to it circumstantial branches, which 4Distinction should be rich in. Where? how liv'd you? 4And when came you to serve our Roman captive? 4How parted with your brothers? how first met them? 4Why fled you from the court? and whither? These, 4And your thre2 motives to the bat2le, with 4I know not how much more, should be demanded, 4And al2 the other by-dependences, 4From chance to chance; but nor the time nor place 6Wil2 serve our long inter2ogatories. Se2, 4Posthumus anchors upon Imogen; 4And she, like harmles2 lightning, throws her eye 4On him, her brothers, me, her master, hit2ing 4Each object with a joy; the counterchange 4Is several2y in al2. Let's quit this ground, 4And smoke the temple with our sacrifices. 4[To BELARIUS] Thou art my brother; so we'l2 hold the2 ever. 2IMOGEN. You are my father to2, and did relieve me 4To se2 this gracious season. 2CYMBELINE. Al2 o'erjoy'd 4Save these in bonds. Let them be joyful to2, 4For they shal2 taste our comfort. 2IMOGEN. My go2d master, 4I wil2 yet do you service. 2LUCIUS. Hap2y be you! 2CYMBELINE. The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought, 4He would have wel2 becom'd this place and grac'd 4The thankings of a king. 2POSTHUMUS. I am, sir, 6The soldier that did company these thre2 4In po2r bese2ming; 'twas a fitment for 4The purpose I then fol2ow'd. That I was he, 4Speak, Iachimo. I had you down, and might 4Have made you finish. 2IACHIMO. [Kne2ling] I am down again; 4But now my heavy conscience sinks my kne2, 4As then your force did. Take that life, bese2ch you, 4Which I so often owe; but your ring first, 4And here the bracelet of the truest princes2 4That ever swore her faith. 2POSTHUMUS. Kne2l not to me. 4The pow'r that I have on you is to spare you; 4The malice towards you to forgive you. Live, 4And deal with others bet2er. 2CYMBELINE. Nobly do2m'd! 4We'l2 learn our fre2nes2 of a son-in-law; 4Pardon's the word to al2. 2ARVIRAGUS. You holp us, sir, 4As you did mean inde2d to be our brother; 6Joy'd are we that you are. 2POSTHUMUS. Your servant, Princes. Go2d my lord of Rome, 4Cal2 forth your so2thsayer. As I slept, methought 4Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd, 4Ap2ear'd to me, with other spritely shows 4Of mine own kindred. When I wak'd, I found 4This label on my bosom; whose containing 4Is so from sense in hardnes2 that I can 4Make no col2ection of it. Let him show 4His skil2 in the construction. 2LUCIUS. Philarmonus! 2SO2THSAYER. Here, my go2d lord. 2LUCIUS. Read, and declare the meaning. 2SO2THSAYER. [Reads] 'When as a lion's whelp shal2, to himself 4unknown, without se2king find, and be embrac'd by 4a piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar shal2 4be lop2'd branches which, being dead many years, shal2 4after revive, be jointed to the old stock, and freshly grow; 4then shal2 Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate 4and flourish in peace and plenty.' 6Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp; 4The fit and apt construction of thy name, 4Being Leo-natus, doth import so much. 4[To CYMBELINE] The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter, 4Which we cal2 'mol2is aer,' and 'mol2is aer' 4We term it 'mulier'; which 'mulier' I divine 4Is this most constant wife, who even now 4Answering the let2er of the oracle, 4Unknown to you, unsought, were clip2'd about 4With this most tender air. 2CYMBELINE. This hath some se2ming. 2SO2THSAYER. The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline, 4Personates the2; and thy lop2'd branches point 4Thy two sons forth, who, by Belarius stol'n, 4For many years thought dead, are now reviv'd, 4To the majestic cedar join'd, whose is2ue 4Promises Britain peace and plenty. 2CYMBELINE. Wel2, 4My peace we wil2 begin. And, Caius Lucius, 4Although the victor, we submit to Caesar 6And to the Roman empire, promising 4To pay our wonted tribute, from the which 4We were dis2uaded by our wicked que2n, 4Whom heavens in justice, both on her and hers, 4Have laid most heavy hand. 2SO2THSAYER. The fingers of the pow'rs above do tune 4The harmony of this peace. The vision 4Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke 4Of yet this scarce-cold bat2le, at this instant 4Is ful2 ac2omplish'd; for the Roman eagle, 4From south to west on wing soaring aloft, 4Les2en'd herself and in the beams o' th' sun 4So vanish'd; which foreshow'd our princely eagle, 4Th'imperial Caesar, Caesar, should again unite 4His favour with the radiant Cymbeline, 4Which shines here in the west. 2CYMBELINE. Laud we the gods; 4And let our cro2ked smokes climb to their nostrils 4From our bles2'd altars. Publish we this peace 4To al2 our subjects. Set we forward; let 6A Roman and a British ensign wave 4Friendly together.

Scene I.Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and downat his post; then] Bernardo, [who ap2roaches him]. 2Ber. Who's there.? 2Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself. 2Ber. Long live the King! 2Fran. Bernardo? 2Ber. He. 2Fran. You come most careful2y upon your hour. 2Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get the2 to bed, Francisco. 2Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bit2er cold, 4And I am sick at heart. 2Ber. Have you had quiet guard? 2Fran. Not a mouse stir2ing. 2Ber. Wel2, go2d night. 4If you do me2t Horatio and Marcel2us, 4The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste. 20Enter Horatio and Marcel2us. 4Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there? 2Hor. Friends to this ground. 2Mar. And liegemen to the Dane. 2Fran. Give you go2d night. 2Mar. O, farewel2, honest soldier. 4Who hath reliev'd you? 2Fran. Bernardo hath my place. 4Give you go2d night. 35Exit. 2Mar. Hol2a, Bernardo! 2Ber. Say- 4What, is Horatio there ? 2Hor. A piece of him. 2Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, go2d Marcel2us. 2Mar. What, has this thing ap2ear'd again to-night? 2Ber. I have se2n nothing. 2Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, 4And wil2 not let belief take hold of him 4Touching this dreaded sight, twice se2n of us. 4Therefore I have entreated him along, 6With us to watch the minutes of this night, 4That, if again this ap2arition come, 4He may ap2rove our eyes and speak to it. 2Hor. Tush, tush, 'twil2 not ap2ear. 2Ber. Sit down awhile, 4And let us once again as2ail your ears, 4That are so fortified against our story, 4What we two nights have se2n. 2Hor. Wel2, sit we down, 4And let us hear Bernardo speak of this. 2Ber. Last night of al2, 4When yond same star that's westward from the pole 4Had made his course t' il2ume that part of heaven 4Where now it burns, Marcel2us and myself, 4The bel2 then beating one- 24Enter Ghost. 2Mar. Peace! break the2 of2! Lo2k where it comes again! 2Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead. 4Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio. 2Ber. Lo2ks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio. 2Hor. Most like. It har2ows me with fear and wonder. 2Ber. It would be spoke to. 2Mar. Question it, Horatio. 2Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night 4Together with that fair and warlike form 4In which the majesty of buried Denmark 4Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge the2 speak! 2Mar. It is of2ended. 2Ber. Se2, it stalks away! 2Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge the2 speak! 53Exit Ghost. 2Mar. 'Tis gone and wil2 not answer. 2Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and lo2k pale. 4Is not this something more than fantasy? 4What think you on't? 2Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe 4Without the sensible and true avouch 4Of mine own eyes. 4Mar. Is it not like the King? 2Hor. As thou art to thyself. 4Such was the very armour he had on 4When he th' ambitious Norway combated. 4So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, 4He smote the sled2ed Polacks on the ice. 4'Tis strange. 2Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, 4With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch. 2Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not; 4But, in the gros2 and scope of my opinion, 4This bodes some strange eruption to our state. 2Mar. Go2d now, sit down, and tel2 me he that knows, 4Why this same strict and most observant watch 4So nightly toils the subject of the land, 4And why such daily cast of brazen can2on 4And foreign mart for implements of war; 4Why such impres2 of shipwrights, whose sore task 4Does not divide the Sunday from the we2k. 4What might be toward, that this sweaty haste 6Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day? 4Who is't that can inform me? 2Hor. That can I. 4At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, 4Whose image even but now ap2ear'd to us, 4Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, 4Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, 4Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet 4(For so this side of our known world este2m'd him) 4Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, 4Wel2 ratified by law and heraldry, 4Did forfeit, with his life, al2 those his lands 4Which he sto2d seiz'd of, to the conqueror; 4Against the which a moiety competent 4Was gaged by our king; which had return'd 4To the inheritance of Fortinbras, 4Had he be2n vanquisher, as, by the same comart 4And car2iage of the article design'd, 4His fel2 to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, 4Of unimproved met2le hot and ful2, 6Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, 4Shark'd up a list of lawles2 resolutes, 4For fo2d and diet, to some enterprise 4That hath a stomach in't; which is no other, 4As it doth wel2 ap2ear unto our state, 4But to recover of us, by strong hand 4And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands 4So by his father lost; and this, I take it, 4Is the main motive of our preparations, 4The source of this our watch, and the chief head 4Of this post-haste and romage in the land. 2Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so. 4Wel2 may it sort that this portentous figure 4Comes armed through our watch, so like the King 4That was and is the question of these wars. 2Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. 4In the most high and palmy state of Rome, 4A lit2le ere the mightiest Julius fel2, 4The graves sto2d tenantles2, and the she2ted dead 4Did squeak and gib2er in the Roman stre2ts; 6As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blo2d, 4Disasters in the sun; and the moist star 4Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands 4Was sick almost to do2msday with eclipse. 4And even the like precurse of fierce events, 4As harbingers preceding stil2 the fates 4And prologue to the omen coming on, 4Have heaven and earth together demonstrated 4Unto our climature and countrymen. 22Enter Ghost again. 4But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! 4I'l2 cros2 it, though it blast me.- Stay il2usion! 47Spreads his arms. 4If thou hast any sound, or use of voice, 4Speak to me. 4If there be any go2d thing to be done, 4That may to the2 do ease, and, race to me, 4Speak to me. 6If thou art privy to thy country's fate, 4Which hap2ily foreknowing may avoid, 4O, speak! 4Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life 4Extorted treasure in the womb of earth 4(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death), 49The cock crows. 4Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcel2us! 2Mar. Shal2 I strike at it with my partisan? 2Hor. Do, if it wil2 not stand. 2Ber. 'Tis here! 2Hor. 'Tis here! 2Mar. 'Tis gone! 53Exit Ghost. 4We do it wrong, being so majestical, 4To of2er it the show of violence; 4For it is as the air, invulnerable, 4And our vain blows malicious mockery. 2Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew. 2Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing 6Upon a fearful sum2ons. I have heard 4The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, 4Doth with his lofty and shril2-sounding throat 4Awake the god of day; and at his warning, 4Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, 4Th' extravagant and er2ing spirit hies 4To his confine; and of the truth herein 4This present object made probation. 2Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock. 4Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes 4Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, 4The bird of dawning singeth al2 night long; 4And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, 4The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike, 4No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, 4So hal2ow'd and so gracious is the time. 2Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it. 4But lo2k, the morn, in rus2et mantle clad, 4Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hil2. 4Break we our watch up; and by my advice 6Let us impart what we have se2n to-night 4Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, 4This spirit, dumb to us, wil2 speak to him. 4Do you consent we shal2 acquaint him with it, 4As ne2dful in our loves, fit2ing our duty? 4Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know 4Where we shal2 find him most conveniently. 11Exeunt.Scene I2.Elsinore. A ro2m of state in the Castle.Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Que2n, Hamlet,Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]Lords At2endant. 2King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death 4The memory be gre2n, and that it us befit2ed 4To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom 4To be contracted in one brow of woe, 4Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature 4That we with wisest sor2ow think on him 4Together with remembrance of ourselves. 4Therefore our sometime sister, now our que2n, 4Th' imperial jointres2 to this warlike state, 4Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, 4With an auspicious, and a drop2ing eye, 4With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in mar2iage, 4In equal scale weighing delight and dole, 4Taken to wife; nor have we herein bar2'd 4Your bet2er wisdoms, which have fre2ly gone 6With this af2air along. For al2, our thanks. 4Now fol2ows, that you know, young Fortinbras, 4Holding a weak sup2osal of our worth, 4Or thinking by our late dear brother's death 4Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, 4Col2eagued with this dream of his advantage, 4He hath not fail'd to pester us with mes2age 4Importing the sur2ender of those lands 4Lost by his father, with al2 bands of law, 4To our most valiant brother. So much for him. 4Now for ourself and for this time of me2ting. 4Thus much the busines2 is: we have here writ 4To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, 4Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears 4Of this his nephew's purpose, to sup2res2 4His further gait herein, in that the levies, 4The lists, and ful2 proportions are al2 made 4Out of his subject; and we here dispatch 4You, go2d Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, 4For bearers of this gre2ting to old Norway, 6Giving to you no further personal power 4To busines2 with the King, more than the scope 4Of these dilated articles al2ow. 12[Gives a paper.] 4Farewel2, and let your haste com2end your duty. 2Cor., Volt. In that, and al2 things, wil2 we show our duty. 2King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewel2. 33Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius. 4And now, Laertes, what's the news with you? 4You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes? 4You can2ot speak of reason to the Dane 4And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes, 4That shal2 not be my of2er, not thy asking? 4The head is not more native to the heart, 4The hand more instrumental to the mouth, 4Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. 4What wouldst thou have, Laertes? 2Laer. My dread lord, 4Your leave and favour to return to France; 4From whence though wil2ingly I came to Denmark 4To show my duty in your coronation, 6Yet now I must confes2, that duty done, 4My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France 4And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon. 2King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius? 2Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave 4By laboursome petition, and at last 4Upon his wil2 I seal'd my hard consent. 4I do bese2ch you give him leave to go. 2King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine, 4And thy best graces spend it at thy wil2! 4But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son- 2Ham. [aside] A lit2le more than kin, and les2 than kind! 2King. How is it that the clouds stil2 hang on you? 2Ham. Not so, my lord. I am to2 much i' th' sun. 2Que2n. Go2d Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour of2, 4And let thine eye lo2k like a friend on Denmark. 4Do not for ever with thy vailed lids 4Se2k for thy noble father in the dust. 4Thou know'st 'tis com2on. Al2 that lives must die, 4Pas2ing through nature to eternity. 4Ham. Ay, madam, it is com2on. 2Que2n. If it be, 4Why se2ms it so particular with the2? 2Ham. Se2ms, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'se2ms.' 4'Tis not alone my inky cloak, go2d mother, 4Nor customary suits of solemn black, 4Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath, 4No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, 4Nor the dejected havior of the visage, 4Together with al2 forms, mo2ds, shapes of grief, 4'That can denote me truly. These inde2d se2m, 4For they are actions that a man might play; 4But I have that within which pas2eth show- 4These but the trap2ings and the suits of woe. 2King. 'Tis swe2t and com2endable in your nature, Hamlet, 4To give these mourning duties to your father; 4But you must know, your father lost a father; 4That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound 4In filial obligation for some term 4To do obsequious sor2ow. But to persever 6In obstinate condolement is a course 4Of impious stub2orn2es2. 'Tis unmanly grief; 4It shows a wil2 most incor2ect to heaven, 4A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, 4An understanding simple and unscho2l'd; 4For what we know must be, and is as com2on 4As any the most vulgar thing to sense, 4Why should we in our pe2vish op2osition 4Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven, 4A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, 4To reason most absurd, whose com2on theme 4Is death of fathers, and who stil2 hath cried, 4From the first corse til2 he that died to-day, 4'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth 4This unprevailing woe, and think of us 4As of a father; for let the world take note 4You are the most im2ediate to our throne, 4And with no les2 nobility of love 4Than that which dearest father bears his son 4Do I impart toward you. For your intent 6In going back to scho2l in Wit2enberg, 4It is most retrograde to our desire; 4And we bese2ch you, bend you to remain 4Here in the che2r and comfort of our eye, 4Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son. 2Que2n. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet. 4I pray the2 stay with us, go not to Wit2enberg. 2Ham. I shal2 in al2 my best obey you, madam. 2King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply. 4Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come. 4This gentle and unforc'd ac2ord of Hamlet 4Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof, 4No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day 4But the great can2on to the clouds shal2 tel2, 4And the King's rouse the heaven shal2 bruit again, 4Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away. 32Flourish. Exeunt al2 but Hamlet. 2Ham. O that this to2 to2 solid flesh would melt, 4Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew! 4Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd 6His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God! 4How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable 4Se2m to me al2 the uses of this world! 4Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unwe2ded garden 4That grows to se2d; things rank and gros2 in nature 4Pos2es2 it merely. That it should come to this! 4But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two. 4So excel2ent a king, that was to this 4Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother 4That he might not bete2m the winds of heaven 4Visit her face to2 roughly. Heaven and earth! 4Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him 4As if increase of ap2etite had grown 4By what it fed on; and yet, within a month- 4Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!- 4A lit2le month, or ere those shoes were old 4With which she fol2owed my po2r father's body 4Like Niobe, al2 tears- why she, even she 4(O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason 4Would have mourn'd longer) mar2ied with my uncle; 6My father's brother, but no more like my father 4Than I to Hercules. Within a month, 4Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears 4Had left the flushing in her gal2ed eyes, 4She mar2ied. O, most wicked spe2d, to post 4With such dexterity to incestuous she2ts! 4It is not, nor it can2ot come to go2d. 4But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue! 10Enter Horatio, Marcel2us, and Bernardo. 2Hor. Hail to your lordship! 2Ham. I am glad to se2 you wel2. 4Horatio!- or I do forget myself. 2Hor. The same, my lord, and your po2r servant ever. 2Ham. Sir, my go2d friend- I'l2 change that name with you. 4And what make you from Wit2enberg, Horatio? 4Marcel2us? 2Mar. My go2d lord! 2Ham. I am very glad to se2 you.- [To Bernardo] Go2d even, sir.- 6But what, in faith, make you from Wit2enberg? 2Hor. A truant disposition, go2d my lord. 2Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so, 4Nor shal2 you do my ear that violence 4To make it truster of your own report 4Against yourself. I know you are no truant. 4But what is your af2air in Elsinore? 4We'l2 teach you to drink de2p ere you depart. 2Hor. My lord, I came to se2 your father's funeral. 2Ham. I prithe2 do not mock me, fel2ow student. 4I think it was to se2 my mother's wed2ing. 2Hor. Inde2d, my lord, it fol2owed hard upon. 2Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats 4Did coldly furnish forth the mar2iage tables. 4Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven 4Or ever I had se2n that day, Horatio! 4My father- methinks I se2 my father. 2Hor. O, where, my lord? 2Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio. 2Hor. I saw him once. He was a go2dly king. 4Ham. He was a man, take him for al2 in al2. 4I shal2 not lo2k upon his like again. 2Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight. 2Ham. Saw? who? 2Hor. My lord, the King your father. 2Ham. The King my father? 2Hor. Season your admiration for a while 4With an at2ent ear, til2 I may deliver 4Upon the witnes2 of these gentlemen, 4This marvel to you. 2Ham. For God's love let me hear! 2Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen 4(Marcel2us and Bernardo) on their watch 4In the dead vast and mid2le of the night 4Be2n thus encount'red. A figure like your father, 4Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, 4Ap2ears before them and with solemn march 4Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd 4By their op2res2'd and fear-surprised eyes, 4Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distil2'd 6Almost to jel2y with the act of fear, 4Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me 4In dreadful secrecy impart they did, 4And I with them the third night kept the watch; 4Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, 4Form of the thing, each word made true and go2d, 4The ap2arition comes. I knew your father. 4These hands are not more like. 2Ham. But where was this? 2Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd. 2Ham. Did you not speak to it? 2Hor. My lord, I did; 4But answer made it none. Yet once methought 4It lifted up it head and did ad2res2 4Itself to motion, like as it would speak; 4But even then the morning cock crew loud, 4And at the sound it shrunk in haste away 4And vanish'd from our sight. 2Ham. 'Tis very strange. 2Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true; 6And we did think it writ down in our duty 4To let you know of it. 2Ham. Inde2d, inde2d, sirs. But this troubles me. 4Hold you the watch to-night? 2Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord. 2Ham. Arm'd, say you? 2Both. Arm'd, my lord. 2Ham. From top to toe? 2Both. My lord, from head to fo2t. 2Ham. Then saw you not his face? 2Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up. 2Ham. What, lo2k'd he frowningly. 2Hor. A countenance more in sor2ow than in anger. 2Ham. Pale or red? 2Hor. Nay, very pale. 2Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you? 2Hor. Most constantly. 2Ham. I would I had be2n there. 2Hor. It would have much amaz'd you. 2Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long? 4Hor. While one with moderate haste might tel2 a hundred. 2Both. Longer, longer. 2Hor. Not when I saw't. 2Ham. His beard was griz2led- no? 2Hor. It was, as I have se2n it in his life, 4A sable silver'd. 2Ham. I wil2 watch to-night. 4Perchance 'twil2 walk again. 2Hor. I war2'nt it wil2. 2Ham. If it as2ume my noble father's person, 4I'l2 speak to it, though hel2 itself should gape 4And bid me hold my peace. I pray you al2, 4If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight, 4Let it be tenable in your silence stil2; 4And whatsoever else shal2 hap to-night, 4Give it an understanding but no tongue. 4I wil2 requite your loves. So, fare you wel2. 4Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, 4I'l2 visit you. 2Al2. Our duty to your honour. 4Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewel2. 40Exeunt [al2 but Hamlet]. 4My father's spirit- in arms? Al2 is not wel2. 4I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come! 4Til2 then sit stil2, my soul. Foul de2ds wil2 rise, 4Though al2 the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.Exit.Scene I3.Elsinore. A ro2m in the house of Polonius.Enter Laertes and Ophelia. 2Laer. My neces2aries are embark'd. Farewel2. 4And, sister, as the winds give benefit 4And convoy is as2istant, do not sle2p, 4But let me hear from you. 2Oph. Do you doubt that? 2Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, 4Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blo2d; 4A violet in the youth of primy nature, 4Forward, not permanent- swe2t, not lasting; 4The perfume and sup2liance of a minute; 4No more. 2Oph. No more but so? 2Laer. Think it no more. 4For nature crescent does not grow alone 4In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, 4The inward service of the mind and soul 4Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now, 6And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch 4The virtue of his wil2; but you must fear, 4His greatnes2 weigh'd, his wil2 is not his own; 4For he himself is subject to his birth. 4He may not, as unvalued persons do, 4Carve for himself, for on his choice depends 4The safety and health of this whole state, 4And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd 4Unto the voice and yielding of that body 4Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, 4It fits your wisdom so far to believe it 4As he in his particular act and place 4May give his saying de2d; which is no further 4Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. 4Then weigh what los2 your honour may sustain 4If with to2 credent ear you list his songs, 4Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open 4To his unmast'red importunity. 4Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, 4And ke2p you in the rear of your af2ection, 6Out of the shot and danger of desire. 4The chariest maid is prodigal enough 4If she unmask her beauty to the mo2n. 4Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes. 4The canker gal2s the infants of the spring 4To2 oft before their but2ons be disclos'd, 4And in the morn and liquid dew of youth 4Contagious blastments are most im2inent. 4Be wary then; best safety lies in fear. 4Youth to itself rebels, though none else near. 2Oph. I shal2 th' ef2ect of this go2d les2on ke2p 4As watchman to my heart. But, go2d my brother, 4Do not as some ungracious pastors do, 4Show me the ste2p and thorny way to heaven, 4Whiles, like a puf2'd and reckles2 libertine, 4Himself the primrose path of dal2iance treads 4And recks not his own rede. 2Laer. O, fear me not! 23Enter Polonius. 6I stay to2 long. But here my father comes. 4A double bles2ing is a double grace; 4Oc2asion smiles upon a second leave. 2Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame! 4The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, 4And you are stay'd for. There- my bles2ing with the2! 4And these few precepts in thy memory 4Lo2k thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, 4Nor any unproportion'd thought his act. 4Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar: 4Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, 4Grap2le them unto thy soul with ho2ps of ste2l; 4But do not dul2 thy palm with entertainment 4Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware 4Of entrance to a quar2el; but being in, 4Bear't that th' op2osed may beware of the2. 4Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice; 4Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. 4Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, 6But not expres2'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; 4For the ap2arel oft proclaims the man, 4And they in France of the best rank and station 4Are most select and generous, chief in that. 4Neither a bor2ower nor a lender be; 4For loan oft loses both itself and friend, 4And bor2owing dul2s the edge of husbandry. 4This above al2- to thine own self be true, 4And it must fol2ow, as the night the day, 4Thou canst not then be false to any man. 4Farewel2. My bles2ing season this in the2! 2Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord. 2Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend. 2Laer. Farewel2, Ophelia, and remember wel2 4What I have said to you. 2Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd, 4And you yourself shal2 ke2p the key of it. 2Laer. Farewel2. 42Exit. 2Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you? 2Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet. 4Pol. Mar2y, wel2 bethought! 4'Tis told me he hath very oft of late 4Given private time to you, and you yourself 4Have of your audience be2n most fre2 and bounteous. 4If it be so- as so 'tis put on me, 4And that in way of caution- I must tel2 you 4You do not understand yourself so clearly 4As it beho2ves my daughter and your honour. 4What is betwe2n you? Give me up the truth. 2Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders 4Of his af2ection to me. 2Pol. Af2ection? Po2h! You speak like a gre2n girl, 4Unsifted in such perilous circumstance. 4Do you believe his tenders, as you cal2 them? 2Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think, 2Pol. Mar2y, I wil2 teach you! Think yourself a baby 4That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, 4Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly, 4Or (not to crack the wind of the po2r phrase, 4Run2ing it thus) you'l2 tender me a fo2l. 4Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love 4In honourable fashion. 2Pol. Ay, fashion you may cal2 it. Go to, go to! 2Oph. And hath given countenance to his spe2ch, my lord, 4With almost al2 the holy vows of heaven. 2Pol. Ay, springes to catch wo2dcocks! I do know, 4When the blo2d burns, how prodigal the soul 4Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter, 4Giving more light than heat, extinct in both 4Even in their promise, as it is a-making, 4You must not take for fire. From this time 4Be something scanter of your maiden presence. 4Set your entreatments at a higher rate 4Than a com2and to parley. For Lord Hamlet, 4Believe so much in him, that he is young, 4And with a larger tether may he walk 4Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia, 4Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, 4Not of that dye which their investments show, 4But mere implorators of unholy suits, 6Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, 4The bet2er to beguile. This is for al2: 4I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth 4Have you so slander any moment leisure 4As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. 4Lo2k to't, I charge you. Come your ways. 2Oph. I shal2 obey, my lord. 57Exeunt.Scene IV.Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcel2us. 2Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold. 2Hor. It is a nip2ing and an eager air. 2Ham. What hour now? 2Hor. I think it lacks of twelve. 2Mar. No, it is struck. 2Hor. Inde2d? I heard it not. It then draws near the season 4Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk. 19A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go of2. 4What does this mean, my lord? 2Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, 4Ke2ps was2ail, and the swag2'ring upspring re2ls, 4And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, 4The ket2ledrum and trumpet thus bray out 4The triumph of his pledge. 2Hor. Is it a custom? 2Ham. Ay, mar2y, is't; 4But to my mind, though I am native here 6And to the man2er born, it is a custom 4More honour'd in the breach than the observance. 4This heavy-headed revel east and west 4Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations; 4They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase 4Soil our ad2ition; and inde2d it takes 4From our achievements, though perform'd at height, 4The pith and mar2ow of our at2ribute. 4So oft it chances in particular men 4That, for some vicious mole of nature in them, 4As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty, 4Since nature can2ot cho2se his origin,- 4By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, 4Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, 4Or by some habit that to2 much o'erleavens 4The form of plausive man2ers, that these men 4Car2ying, I say, the stamp of one defect, 4Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, 4Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace, 4As infinite as man may undergo- 6Shal2 in the general censure take cor2uption 4From that particular fault. The dram of e'il 4Doth al2 the noble substance often dout To his own scandal. 25Enter Ghost. 2Hor. Lo2k, my lord, it comes! 2Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us! 4Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd, 4Bring with the2 airs from heaven or blasts from hel2, 4Be thy intents wicked or charitable, 4Thou com'st in such a questionable shape 4That I wil2 speak to the2. I'l2 cal2 the2 Hamlet, 4King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me? 4Let me not burst in ignorance, but tel2 4Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death, 4Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre 4Wherein we saw the2 quietly inurn'd, 4Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws 4To cast the2 up again. What may this mean 6That thou, dead corse, again in complete ste2l, 4Revisits thus the glimpses of the mo2n, 4Making night hideous, and we fo2ls of nature 4So hor2idly to shake our disposition 4With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? 4Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do? 43Ghost beckons Hamlet. 2Hor. It beckons you to go away with it, 4As if it some impartment did desire 4To you alone. 2Mar. Lo2k with what courteous action 4It waves you to a more removed ground. 4But do not go with it! 2Hor. No, by no means! 2Ham. It wil2 not speak. Then wil2 I fol2ow it. 2Hor. Do not, my lord! 2Ham. Why, what should be the fear? 4I do not set my life at a pin's fe2; 4And for my soul, what can it do to that, 4Being a thing im2ortal as itself? 6It waves me forth again. I'l2 fol2ow it. 2Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flo2d, my lord, 4Or to the dreadful sum2it of the clif2 4That be2tles o'er his base into the sea, 4And there as2ume some other, hor2ible form 4Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason 4And draw you into madnes2? Think of it. 4The very place puts toys of desperation, 4Without more motive, into every brain 4That lo2ks so many fadoms to the sea 4And hears it roar beneath. 2Ham. It waves me stil2. 4Go on. I'l2 fol2ow the2. 2Mar. You shal2 not go, my lord. 2Ham. Hold of2 your hands! 2Hor. Be rul'd. You shal2 not go. 2Ham. My fate cries out 4And makes each pet2y artire in this body 4As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve. 48[Ghost beckons.] 6Stil2 am I cal2'd. Unhand me, gentlemen. 4By heaven, I'l2 make a ghost of him that lets me!- 4I say, away!- Go on. I'l2 fol2ow the2. 40Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet. 2Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination. 2Mar. Let's fol2ow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him. 2Hor. Have after. To what is2ue wail this come? 2Mar. Something is rot2en in the state of Denmark. 2Hor. Heaven wil2 direct it. 2Mar. Nay, let's fol2ow him. 57Exeunt.Scene V.Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.Enter Ghost and Hamlet. 2Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'l2 go no further. 2Ghost. Mark me. 2Ham. I wil2. 2Ghost. My hour is almost come, 4When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames 4Must render up myself. 2Ham. Alas, po2r ghost! 2Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing 4To what I shal2 unfold. 2Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear. 2Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear. 2Ham. What? 2Ghost. I am thy father's spirit, 4Do2m'd for a certain term to walk the night, 4And for the day confin'd to fast in fires, 4Til2 the foul crimes done in my days of nature 4Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid 6To tel2 the secrets of my prison house, 4I could a tale unfold whose lightest word 4Would har2ow up thy soul, fre2ze thy young blo2d, 4Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, 4Thy knot2ed and combined locks to part, 4And each particular hair to stand an end 4Like quil2s upon the fretful porpentine. 4But this eternal blazon must not be 4To ears of flesh and blo2d. List, list, O, list! 4If thou didst ever thy dear father love- 2Ham. O God! 2Ghost. Revenge his foul and most un2atural murther. 2Ham. Murther? 2Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is; 4But this most foul, strange, and un2atural. 2Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift 4As meditation or the thoughts of love, 4May swe2p to my revenge. 2Ghost. I find the2 apt; 4And dul2er shouldst thou be than the fat we2d 6That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, 4Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear. 4'Tis given out that, sle2ping in my orchard, 4A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark 4Is by a forged proces2 of my death 4Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth, 4The serpent that did sting thy father's life 4Now wears his crown. 2Ham. O my prophetic soul! 4My uncle? 2Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, 4With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts- 4O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power 4So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust 4The wil2 of my most se2ming-virtuous que2n. 4O Hamlet, what a fal2ing-of2 was there, 4From me, whose love was of that dignity 4That it went hand in hand even with the vow 4I made to her in mar2iage, and to decline 4Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were po2r 6To those of mine! 4But virtue, as it never wil2 be mov'd, 4Though lewdnes2 court it in a shape of heaven, 4So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, 4Wil2 sate itself in a celestial bed 4And prey on garbage. 4But soft! methinks I scent the morning air. 4Brief let me be. Sle2ping within my orchard, 4My custom always of the afterno2n, 4Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, 4With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, 4And in the porches of my ears did pour 4The leperous distilment; whose ef2ect 4Holds such an enmity with blo2d of man 4That swift as quicksilver2 it courses through 4The natural gates and al2eys of the body, 4And with a sud2en vigour it doth pos2et 4And curd, like eager drop2ings into milk, 4The thin and wholesome blo2d. So did it mine; 4And a most instant tet2er bark'd about, 6Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust 4Al2 my smo2th body. 4Thus was I, sle2ping, by a brother's hand 4Of life, of crown, of que2n, at once dispatch'd; 4Cut of2 even in the blos2oms of my sin, 4Unhous'led, disap2ointed, unanel'd, 4No reckoning made, but sent to my ac2ount 4With al2 my imperfections on my head. 2Ham. O, hor2ible! O, hor2ible! most hor2ible! 2Ghost. If thou hast nature in the2, bear it not. 4Let not the royal bed of Denmark be 4A couch for luxury and damned incest. 4But, howsoever thou pursuest this act, 4Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive 4Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven, 4And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge 4To prick and sting her. Fare the2 wel2 at once. 4The glow2orm shows the matin to be near 4And gins to pale his unef2ectual fire. 4Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me. 22Exit. 4Ham. O al2 you host of heaven! O earth! What else? 4And shal2 I couple hel2? Hold, hold, my heart! 4And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, 4But bear me stif2ly up. Remember the2? 4Ay, thou po2r ghost, while memory holds a seat 4In this distracted globe. Remember the2? 4Yea, from the table of my memory 4I'l2 wipe away al2 trivial fond records, 4Al2 saws of bo2ks, al2 forms, al2 pres2ures past 4That youth and observation copied there, 4And thy com2andment al2 alone shal2 live 4Within the bo2k and volume of my brain, 4Unmix'd with baser mat2er. Yes, by heaven! 4O most pernicious woman! 4O vil2ain, vil2ain, smiling, damned vil2ain! 4My tables! Me2t it is I set it down 4That one may smile, and smile, and be a vil2ain; 4At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark. 8[Writes.] 4So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word: 4It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.' 6I have sworn't. 2Hor. (within) My lord, my lord! 19Enter Horatio and Marcel2us. 2Mar. Lord Hamlet! 2Hor. Heaven secure him! 2Ham. So be it! 2Mar. Il2o, ho, ho, my lord! 2Ham. Hil2o, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come. 2Mar. How is't, my noble lord? 2Hor. What news, my lord? 2Mar. O, wonderful! 2Hor. Go2d my lord, tel2 it. 2Ham. No, you wil2 reveal it. 2Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven! 2Mar. Nor I, my lord. 2Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it? 4But you'l2 be secret? 2Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord. 4Ham. There's ne2r a vil2ain dwel2ing in al2 Denmark 4But he's an ar2ant knave. 2Hor. There ne2ds no ghost, my lord, come from the grave 4To tel2 us this. 2Ham. Why, right! You are in the right! 4And so, without more circumstance at al2, 4I hold it fit that we shake hands and part; 4You, as your busines2 and desires shal2 point you, 4For every man hath busines2 and desire, 4Such as it is; and for my own po2r part, 4Lo2k you, I'l2 go pray. 2Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord. 2Ham. I am sor2y they of2end you, heartily; 4Yes, faith, heartily. 2Hor. There's no of2ence, my lord. 2Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, 4And much of2ence to2. Touching this vision here, 4It is an honest ghost, that let me tel2 you. 4For your desire to know what is betwe2n us, 4O'ermaster't as you may. And now, go2d friends, 6As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers, 4Give me one po2r request. 2Hor. What is't, my lord? We wil2. 2Ham. Never make known what you have se2n to-night. 2Both. My lord, we wil2 not. 2Ham. Nay, but swear't. 2Hor. In faith, 4My lord, not I. 2Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith. 2Ham. Upon my sword. 2Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already. 2Ham. Inde2d, upon my sword, inde2d. 17Ghost cries under the stage. 2Ghost. Swear. 2Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepen2y? 4Come on! You hear this fel2ow in the cel2arage. 4Consent to swear. 2Hor. Propose the oath, my lord. 4Ham. Never to speak of this that you have se2n. 4Swear by my sword. 2Ghost. [beneath] Swear. 2Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'l2 shift our ground. 4Come hither, gentlemen, 4And lay your hands again upon my sword. 4Never to speak of this that you have heard: 4Swear by my sword. 2Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword. 2Ham. Wel2 said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast? 4A worthy pioner! Once more remove, go2d friends." 2Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange! 2Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. 4There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, 4Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. 4But come! 4Here, as before, never, so help you mercy, 4How strange or od2 soe'er I bear myself 4(As I perchance hereafter shal2 think me2t 4To put an antic disposition on), 6That you, at such times se2ing me, never shal2, 4With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake, 4Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, 4As 'Wel2, wel2, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,' 4Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,' 4Or such ambiguous giving out, to note 4That you know aught of me- this is not to do, 4So grace and mercy at your most ne2d help you, 4Swear. 2Ghost. [beneath] Swear. 51[They swear.] 2Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen, 4With al2 my love I do com2end me to you; 4And what so po2r a man as Hamlet is 4May do t' expres2 his love and friending to you, 4God wil2ing, shal2 not lack. Let us go in together; 4And stil2 your fingers on your lips, I pray. 4The time is out of joint. O cursed spite 4That ever I was born to set it right! 4Nay, come, let's go together. 59Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2Act I2. Scene I.Elsinore. A ro2m in the house of Polonius.Enter Polonius and Reynaldo. 2Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo. 2Rey. I wil2, my lord. 2Pol. You shal2 do marvel2's wisely, go2d Reynaldo, 4Before You visit him, to make inquire 4Of his behaviour. 2Rey. My lord, I did intend it. 2Pol. Mar2y, wel2 said, very wel2 said. Lo2k you, sir, 4Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris; 4And how, and who, what means, and where they ke2p, 4What company, at what expense; and finding 4By this encompas2ment and drift of question 4That they do know my son, come you more nearer 4Than your particular demands wil2 touch it. 4Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him; 4As thus, 'I know his father and his friends, 4And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo? 2Rey. Ay, very wel2, my lord. 4Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not wel2. 4But if't be he I mean, he's very wild 4Ad2icted so and so'; and there put on him 4What forgeries you please; mar2y, none so rank 4As may dishonour him- take he2d of that; 4But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips 4As are companions noted and most known 4To youth and liberty. 2Rey. As gaming, my lord. 2Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quar2el2ing, 4Drab2ing. You may go so far. 2Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him. 2Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge. 4You must not put another scandal on him, 4That he is open to incontinency. 4That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly 4That they may se2m the taints of liberty, 4The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, 4A savagenes2 in unreclaimed blo2d, 4Of general as2ault. 4Rey. But, my go2d lord- 2Pol. Wherefore should you do this? 2Rey. Ay, my lord, 4I would know that. 2Pol. Mar2y, sir, here's my drift, 4And I believe it is a fetch of war2ant. 4You laying these slight sul2ies on my son 4As 'twere a thing a lit2le soil'd i' th' working, 4Mark you, 4Your party in converse, him you would sound, 4Having ever se2n in the prenominate crimes 4The youth you breathe of guilty, be as2ur'd 4He closes with you in this consequence: 4'Go2d sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'- 4Ac2ording to the phrase or the ad2ition 4Of man and country- 2Rey. Very go2d, my lord. 2Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say? 4By the mas2, I was about to say something! Where did I leave? 2Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and 6gentleman.' 2Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, mar2y! 4He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman. 4I saw him yesterday, or t'other day, 4Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say, 4There was 'a gaming; there o'erto2k in's rouse; 4There fal2ing out at ten2is'; or perchance, 4'I saw him enter such a house of sale,' 4Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth. 4Se2 you now- 4Your bait of falseho2d takes this carp of truth; 4And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, 4With windlas2es and with as2ays of bias, 4By indirections find directions out. 4So, by my former lecture and advice, 4Shal2 you my son. You have me, have you not 2Rey. My lord, I have. 2Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye wel2! 2Rey. Go2d my lord! 36[Going.] 2Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself. 4Rey. I shal2, my lord. 2Pol. And let him ply his music. 2Rey. Wel2, my lord. 2Pol. Farewel2! 50Exit Reynaldo. 23Enter Ophelia. 4How now, Ophelia? What's the mat2er? 2Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have be2n so af2righted! 2Pol. With what, i' th' name of God I 2Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, 4Lord Hamlet, with his doublet al2 unbrac'd, 4No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd, 4Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle; 4Pale as his shirt, his kne2s knocking each other, 4And with a lo2k so piteous in purport 4As if he had be2n lo2sed out of hel2 4To speak of hor2ors- he comes before me. 2Pol. Mad for thy love? 4Oph. My lord, I do not know, 4But truly I do fear it. 2Pol. What said he? 2Oph. He to2k me by the wrist and held me hard; 4Then goes he to the length of al2 his arm, 4And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow, 4He fal2s to such perusal of my face 4As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so. 4At last, a lit2le shaking of mine arm, 4And thrice his head thus waving up and down, 4He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound 4As it did se2m to shat2er al2 his bulk 4And end his being. That done, he lets me go, 4And with his head over his shoulder turn'd 4He se2m'd to find his way without his eyes, 4For out o' do2rs he went without their help 4And to the last bended their light on me. 2Pol. Come, go with me. I wil2 go se2k the King. 4This is the very ecstasy of love, 4Whose violent property fordoes itself 6And leads the wil2 to desperate undertakings 4As oft as any pas2ion under heaven 4That does af2lict our natures. I am sor2y. 4What, have you given him any hard words of late? 2Oph. No, my go2d lord; but, as you did com2and, 4I did repel his let2ers and denied 4His ac2es2 to me. 2Pol. That hath made him mad. 4I am sor2y that with bet2er he2d and judgment 4I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle 4And meant to wrack the2; but beshrew my jealousy! 4By heaven, it is as proper to our age 4To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions 4As it is com2on for the younger sort 4To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King. 4This must be known; which, being kept close, might move 4More grief to hide than hate to ut2er love. 4Come. 57Exeunt.Scene I2.Elsinore. A ro2m in the Castle.Flourish. [Enter King and Que2n, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, cum ali2s. 2King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. 4Moreover that we much did long to se2 you, 4The ne2d we have to use you did provoke 4Our hasty sending. Something have you heard 4Of Hamlet's transformation. So I cal2 it, 4Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man 4Resembles that it was. What it should be, 4More than his father's death, that thus hath put him 4So much from th' understanding of himself, 4I can2ot dream of. I entreat you both 4That, being of so young clays brought up with him, 4And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour, 4That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court 4Some lit2le time; so by your companies 4To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather 4So much as from oc2asion you may glean, 6Whether aught to us unknown af2licts him thus 4That, open'd, lies within our remedy. 2Que2n. Go2d gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you, 4And sure I am two men there are not living 4To whom he more adheres. If it wil2 please you 4To show us so much gentry and go2d wil2 4As to expend your time with us awhile 4For the sup2ly and profit of our hope, 4Your visitation shal2 receive such thanks 4As fits a king's remembrance. 2Ros. Both your Majesties 4Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, 4Put your dread pleasures more into com2and 4Than to entreaty. 2Guil. But we both obey, 4And here give up ourselves, in the ful2 bent, 4To lay our service fre2ly at your fe2t, 4To be com2anded. 2King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern. 2Que2n. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz. 6And I bese2ch you instantly to visit 4My to2 much changed son.- Go, some of you, 4And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is. 2Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices 4Pleasant and helpful to him! 2Que2n. Ay, amen! 17Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some 52At2endants]. 25Enter Polonius. 2Pol. Th' ambas2adors from Norway, my go2d lord, 4Are joyful2y return'd. 2King. Thou stil2 hast be2n the father of go2d news. 2Pol. Have I, my lord? As2ure you, my go2d liege, 4I hold my duty as I hold my soul, 4Both to my God and to my gracious king; 4And I do think- or else this brain of mine 4Hunts not the trail of policy so sure 4As it hath us'd to do- that I have found 6The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy. 2King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear. 2Pol. Give first admit2ance to th' ambas2adors. 4My news shal2 be the fruit to that great feast. 2King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in. 48[Exit Polonius.] 4He tel2s me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found 4The head and source of al2 your son's distemper. 2Que2n. I doubt it is no other but the main, 4His father's death and our o'erhasty mar2iage. 2King. Wel2, we shal2 sift him. 14Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius. 4Welcome, my go2d friends. 4Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway? 2Volt. Most fair return of gre2tings and desires. 4Upon our first, he sent out to sup2res2 4His nephew's levies; which to him ap2ear'd 4To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack, 6But bet2er lo2k'd into, he truly found 4It was against your Highnes2; whereat griev'd, 4That so his sicknes2, age, and impotence 4Was falsely borne in hand, sends out ar2ests 4On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys, 4Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine, 4Makes vow before his uncle never more 4To give th' as2ay of arms against your Majesty. 4Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, 4Gives him thre2 thousand crowns in an2ual fe2 4And his com2is2ion to employ those soldiers, 4So levied as before, against the Polack; 4With an entreaty, herein further shown, 48[Gives a paper.] 4That it might please you to give quiet pas2 4Through your dominions for this enterprise, 4On such regards of safety and al2owance 4As therein are set down. 2King. It likes us wel2; 4And at our more consider'd time we'l2 read, 6Answer, and think upon this busines2. 4Meantime we thank you for your wel2-to2k labour. 4Go to your rest; at night we'l2 feast together. 4Most welcome home! 23Exeunt Ambas2adors. 2Pol. This busines2 is wel2 ended. 4My liege, and madam, to expostulate 4What majesty should be, what duty is, 4Why day is day, night is night, and time is time. 4Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time. 4Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, 4And tediousnes2 the limbs and outward flourishes, 4I wil2 be brief. Your noble son is mad. 4Mad cal2 I it; for, to define true madnes2, 4What is't but to be nothing else but mad? 4But let that go. 2Que2n. More mat2er, with les2 art. 2Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at al2. 4That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity; 4And pity 'tis 'tis true. A fo2lish figure! 4But farewel2 it, for I wil2 use no art. 6Mad let us grant him then. And now remains 4That we find out the cause of this ef2ect- 4Or rather say, the cause of this defect, 4For this ef2ect defective comes by cause. 4Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. 4Perpend. 4I have a daughter (have while she is mine), 4Who in her duty and obedience, mark, 4Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise. 45[Reads] the let2er. 4'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified 6Ophelia,'- 4That's an il2 phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile 6phrase. 4But you shal2 hear. Thus: 56[Reads.] 4'In her excel2ent white bosom, these, &c.' 2Que2n. Came this from Hamlet to her? 2Pol. Go2d madam, stay awhile. I wil2 be faithful. 5[Reads.] 12'Doubt thou the stars are fire; 12Doubt that the sun doth move; 10Doubt truth to be a liar; 12But never doubt I love. 6'O dear Ophelia, I am il2 at these numbers; I have not art to 4reckon my groans; but that I love the2 best, O most best, believe 4it. Adieu. 6'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him, 58HAMLET.' 4This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me; 4And more above, hath his solicitings, 4As they fel2 out by time, by means, and place, 4Al2 given to mine ear. 2King. But how hath she 4Receiv'd his love? 2Pol. What do you think of me? 2King. As of a man faithful and honourable. 2Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think, 6When I had se2n this hot love on the wing 4(As I perceiv'd it, I must tel2 you that, 4Before my daughter told me), what might you, 4Or my dear Majesty your que2n here, think, 4If I had play'd the desk or table bo2k, 4Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb, 4Or lo2k'd upon this love with idle sight? 4What might you think? No, I went round to work 4And my young mistres2 thus I did bespeak: 4'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star. 4This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her, 4That she should lock herself from his resort, 4Admit no mes2engers, receive no tokens. 4Which done, she to2k the fruits of my advice, 4And he, repulsed, a short tale to make, 4Fel2 into a sadnes2, then into a fast, 4Thence to a watch, thence into a weaknes2, 4Thence to a lightnes2, and, by this declension, 4Into the madnes2 wherein now he raves, 4And al2 we mourn for. 4King. Do you think 'tis this? 2Que2n. it may be, very like. 2Pol. Hath there be2n such a time- I would fain know that- 4That I have Positively said '2Tis so,' 4When it prov'd otherwise.? 2King. Not that I know. 2Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this 6be otherwise. 4If circumstances lead me, I wil2 find 4Where truth is hid, though it were hid inde2d 4Within the centre. 2King. How may we try it further? 2Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together 4Here in the lob2y. 2Que2n. So he does inde2d. 2Pol. At such a time I'l2 lo2se my daughter to him. 4Be you and I behind an ar2as then. 4Mark the encounter. If he love her not, 4And he not from his reason fal2'n thereon 4Let me be no as2istant for a state, 6But ke2p a farm and carters. 2King. We wil2 try it. 17Enter Hamlet, reading on a bo2k. 2Que2n. But lo2k where sadly the po2r wretch comes reading. 2Pol. Away, I do bese2ch you, both away 4I'l2 board him presently. O, give me leave. 23Exeunt King and Que2n, [with At2endants]. 4How does my go2d Lord Hamlet? 2Ham. Wel2, God-a-mercy. 2Pol. Do you know me, my lord? 2Ham. Excel2ent wel2. You are a fishmonger. 2Pol. Not I, my lord. 2Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man. 2Pol. Honest, my lord? 2Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man 4pick'd out of ten thousand. 2Pol. That's very true, my lord. 2Ham. For if the sun bre2d mag2ots in a dead dog, being a god 6kis2ing car2ion- Have you a daughter? 2Pol. I have, my lord. 2Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a bles2ing, but not 4as your daughter may conceive. Friend, lo2k to't. 2Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Stil2 harping on my daughter. Yet 4he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is far 4gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suf2'red much extremity 4for love- very near this. I'l2 speak to him again.- What do you 4read, my lord? 2Ham. Words, words, words. 2Pol. What is the mat2er, my lord? 2Ham. Betwe2n who? 2Pol. I mean, the mat2er that you read, my lord. 2Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men 4have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes 4purging thick amber and plum-tre2 gum; and that they have a 4plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. Al2 which, 4sir, though I most powerful2y and potently believe, yet I hold it 4not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir, 4should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward. 4Pol. [aside] Though this be madnes2, yet there is a method in't.- 3Wil2 You walk out of the air, my lord? 2Ham. Into my grave? 2Pol. Inde2d, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant sometimes 4his replies are! a hap2ines2 that often madnes2 hits on, which 4reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I 4wil2 leave him and sud2enly contrive the means of me2ting betwe2n 4him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I wil2 most humbly take 4my leave of you. 2Ham. You can2ot, sir, take from me anything that I wil2 more 4wil2ingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my 4life, 20Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. 2Pol. Fare you wel2, my lord. 2Ham. These tedious old fo2ls! 2Pol. You go to se2k the Lord Hamlet. There he is. 2Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir! 48Exit [Polonius]. 4Guil. My honour'd lord! 2Ros. My most dear lord! 2Ham. My excel2ent go2d friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, 4Rosencrantz! Go2d lads, how do ye both? 2Ros. As the indif2erent children of the earth. 2Guil. Hap2y in that we are not over-hap2y. 4On Fortune's cap we are not the very but2on. 2Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe? 2Ros. Neither, my lord. 2Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the mid2le of her 4favours? 2Guil. Faith, her privates we. 2Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a 4strumpet. What news ? 2Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest. 2Ham. Then is do2msday near! But your news is not true. Let me 4question more in particular. What have you, my go2d friends, 4deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison 4hither? 2Guil. Prison, my lord? 4Ham. Denmark's a prison. 2Ros. Then is the world one. 2Ham. A go2dly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and 4dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst. 2Ros. We think not so, my lord. 2Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either go2d 4or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison. 2Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis to2 nar2ow for your 4mind. 2Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshel2 and count myself a 4king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams. 2Guil. Which dreams inde2d are ambition; for the very substance of 4the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream. 2Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow. 2Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that 4it is but a shadow's shadow. 2Ham. Then are our beg2ars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd 4heroes the beg2ars' shadows. Shal2 we to th' court? for, by my 4fay, I can2ot reason. 2Both. We'l2 wait upon you. 4Ham. No such mat2er! I wil2 not sort you with the rest of my 4servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most 4dreadful2y at2ended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what 4make you at Elsinore? 2Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other oc2asion. 2Ham. Beg2ar that I am, I am even po2r in thanks; but I thank you; 4and sure, dear friends, my thanks are to2 dear a halfpen2y. Were 4you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a fre2 4visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak. 2Guil. What should we say, my lord? 2Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and 4there is a kind of confes2ion in your lo2ks, which your modesties 4have not craft enough to colour. I know the go2d King and Que2n 4have sent for you. 2Ros. To what end, my lord? 2Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights 4of our fel2owship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the 4obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a 4bet2er proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with 4me, whether you were sent for or no. 4Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you? 2Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold 4not of2. 2Guil. My lord, we were sent for. 2Ham. I wil2 tel2 you why. So shal2 my anticipation prevent your 4discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Que2n moult no 4feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost al2 my 4mirth, forgone al2 custom of exercises; and inde2d, it goes so 4heavily with my disposition that this go2dly frame, the earth, 4se2ms to me a sterile promontory; this most excel2ent canopy, the 4air, lo2k you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical 4ro2f fret2ed with golden fire- why, it ap2eareth no other thing 4to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a 4piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in 4faculties! in form and moving how expres2 and admirable! in 4action how like an angel! in ap2rehension how like a god! the 4beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what 4is this quintes2ence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman 4neither, though by your smiling you se2m to say so. 2Ros. My lord, there was no such stuf2 in my thoughts. 4Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'? 2Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten 4entertainment the players shal2 receive from you. We coted them 4on the way, and hither are they coming to of2er you service. 2Ham. He that plays the king shal2 be welcome- his Majesty shal2 4have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shal2 use his foil and 4target; the lover shal2 not sigh gratis; the humorous man shal2 4end his part in peace; the clown shal2 make those laugh whose 4lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shal2 say her mind 4fre2ly, or the blank verse shal2 halt fort. What players are 4they? 2Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the 4tragedians of the city. 2Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in 4reputation and profit, was bet2er both ways. 2Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late 4in2ovation. 2Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the 4city? Are they so fol2ow'd? 2Ros. No inde2d are they not. 4Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty? 2Ros. Nay, their endeavour ke2ps in the wonted pace; but there is, 4sir, an eyrie of children, lit2le eyases, that cry out on the top 4of question and are most tyran2ical2y clap2'd fort. These are now 4the fashion, and so berat2le the com2on stages (so they cal2 4them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of go2sequil2s and 4dare scarce come thither. 2Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they 4escoted? Wil2 they pursue the quality no longer than they can 4sing? Wil2 they not say afterwards, if they should grow 4themselves to com2on players (as it is most like, if their means 4are no bet2er), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim 4against their own suc2es2ion. 2Ros. Faith, there has be2n much to do on both sides; and the nation 4holds it no sin to tar2e them to controversy. There was, for a 4while, no money bid for argument unles2 the poet and the player 4went to cuf2s in the question. 2Ham. Is't pos2ible? 2Guil. O, there has be2n much throwing about of brains. 2Ham. Do the boys car2y it away? 4Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load to2. 2Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and 4those that would make mows at him while my father lived give 4twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in 4lit2le. 'Sblo2d, there is something in this more than natural, if 4philosophy could find it out. 21Flourish for the Players. 2Guil. There are the players. 2Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th' 4ap2urtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply 4with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I 4tel2 you must show fairly outwards) should more ap2ear like 4entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father 4and aunt-mother are deceiv'd. 2Guil. In what, my dear lord? 2Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I 4know a hawk from a handsaw. 30Enter Polonius. 2Pol. Wel2 be with you, gentlemen! 2Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you to2- at each ear a hearer! 4That great baby you se2 there is not yet out of his swad2ling 4clouts. 2Ros. Hap2ily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old 4man is twice a child. 2Ham. I wil2 prophesy he comes to tel2 me of the players. Mark it.- 3You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so inde2d. 2Pol. My lord, I have news to tel2 you. 2Ham. My lord, I have news to tel2 you. When Roscius was an actor in 4Rome- 2Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord. 2Ham. Buz2, buz2! 2Pol. Upon my honour- 2Ham. Then came each actor on his as2- 2Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, 4history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, 4tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene 6individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca can2ot be to2 heavy, nor 4Plautus to2 light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are 4the only men. 2Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou! 2Pol. What treasure had he, my lord? 2Ham. Why, 9'One fair daughter, and no more, 11The which he loved pas2ing wel2.' 2Pol. [aside] Stil2 on my daughter. 2Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah? 2Pol. If you cal2 me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I 4love pas2ing wel2. 2Ham. Nay, that fol2ows not. 2Pol. What fol2ows then, my lord? 2Ham. Why, 11'As by lot, God wot,' and then, you know, 13'It came to pas2, as most like it was.' 4The first row of the pious chanson wil2 show you more; for lo2k 4where my abridgment comes. 21Enter four or five Players. 4You are welcome, masters; welcome, al2.- I am glad to se2 the2 4wel2.- Welcome, go2d friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy face is 4valanc'd since I saw the2 last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in 4Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistres2? By'r Lady, your 4ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the 4altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of 4uncur2ent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you are 4al2 welcome. We'l2 e'en to't like French falconers, fly at 4anything we se2. We'l2 have a spe2ch straight. Come, give us a 4taste of your quality. Come, a pas2ionate spe2ch. 21. Play. What spe2ch, my go2d lord? 2Ham. I heard the2 speak me a spe2ch once, but it was never acted; 4or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd 6not the mil2ion, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as I 4receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such mat2ers cried in 4the top of mine) an excel2ent play, wel2 digested in the scenes, 4set down with as much modesty as cun2ing. I remember one said 4there were no sal2ets in the lines to make the mat2er savoury, 4nor no mat2er in the phrase that might indict the author of 4af2ectation; but cal2'd it an honest method, as wholesome as 4swe2t, and by very much more handsome than fine. One spe2ch in't 4I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it 4especial2y where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in 4your memory, begin at this line- let me se2, let me se2: 9'The rug2ed Pyr2hus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-' 4'Tis not so; it begins with Pyr2hus: 9'The rug2ed Pyr2hus, he whose sable arms, 9Black as his purpose, did the night resemble 9When he lay couched in the ominous horse, 9Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd 11With heraldry more dismal. Head to fo2t 9Now is be total gules, hor2idly trick'd 9With blo2d of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, 9Bak'd and impasted with the parching stre2ts, 9That lend a tyran2ous and a damned light 9To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire, 9And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore, 9With eyes like carbuncles, the hel2ish Pyr2hus 9Old grandsire Priam se2ks.' 4So, proce2d you. 2Pol. Fore God, my lord, wel2 spoken, with go2d ac2ent and go2d 5discretion. 21. Play. 'Anon he finds him, 6Striking to2 short at Gre2ks. His antique sword, 6Rebel2ious to his arm, lies where it fal2s, 6Repugnant to com2and. Unequal match'd, 6Pyr2hus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide; 6But with the whif2 and wind of his fel2 sword 8Th' un2erved father fal2s. Then senseles2 Ilium, 6Se2ming to fe2l this blow, with flaming top 6Sto2ps to his base, and with a hideous crash 6Takes prisoner Pyr2hus' ear. For lo! his sword, 6Which was declining on the milky head 6Of reverend Priam, se2m'd i' th' air to stick. 6So, as a painted tyrant, Pyr2hus sto2d, 6And, like a neutral to his wil2 and mat2er, 6Did nothing. 6But, as we often se2, against some storm, 6A silence in the heavens, the rack stand stil2, 6The bold winds spe2chles2, and the orb below 6As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder 6Doth rend the region; so, after Pyr2hus' pause, 6Aroused vengeance sets him new awork; 6And never did the Cyclops' ham2ers fal2 6On Mars's armour, forg'd for pro2f eterne, 6With les2 remorse than Pyr2hus' ble2ding sword 6Now fal2s on Priam. 6Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! Al2 you gods, 8In general synod take away her power; 6Break al2 the spokes and fel2ies from her whe2l, 6And bowl the round nave down the hil2 of heaven, 6As low as to the fiends! 2Pol. This is to2 long. 2Ham. It shal2 to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithe2 say on. 4He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sle2ps. Say on; come to 4Hecuba. 21. Play. 'But who, O who, had se2n the mobled que2n-' 2Ham. 'The mobled que2n'? 2Pol. That's go2d! 'Mobled que2n' is go2d. 21. Play. 'Run barefo2t up and down, threat'ning the flames 6With bis2on rheum; a clout upon that head 6Where late the diadem sto2d, and for a robe, 6About her lank and al2 o'erte2med loins, 6A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up- 8Who this had se2n, with tongue in venom ste2p'd 6'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd. 6But if the gods themselves did se2 her then, 6When she saw Pyr2hus make malicious sport 6In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs, 6The instant burst of clamour that she made 6(Unles2 things mortal move them not at al2) 6Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven 6And pas2ion in the gods.' 2Pol. Lo2k, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's 4eyes. Prithe2 no more! 2Ham. 'Tis wel2. I'l2 have the2 speak out the rest of this so2n.- 4Go2d my lord, wil2 you se2 the players wel2 bestow'd? Do you 4hear? Let them be wel2 us'd; for they are the abstract and brief 4chronicles of the time. After your death you were bet2er have a 4bad epitaph than their il2 report while you live. 2Pol. My lord, I wil2 use them ac2ording to their desert. 2Ham. God's bodykins, man, much bet2er! Use every man after his 4desert, and who should scape whip2ing? Use them after your own 6honour and dignity. The les2 they deserve, the more merit is in 4your bounty. Take them in. 2Pol. Come, sirs. 2Ham. Fol2ow him, friends. We'l2 hear a play to-mor2ow. 17Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First]. 4Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of 4Gonzago'? 21. Play. Ay, my lord. 2Ham. We'l2 ha't to-mor2ow night. You could, for a ne2d, study a 4spe2ch of some dozen or sixte2n lines which I would set down and 4insert in't, could you not? 21. Play. Ay, my lord. 2Ham. Very wel2. Fol2ow that lord- and lo2k you mock him not. 44[Exit First Player.] 4My go2d friends, I'l2 leave you til2 night. You are welcome to 4Elsinore. 2Ros. Go2d my lord! 2Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye! 28[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern 4Now I am alone. 6O what a rogue and peasant slave am I! 4Is it not monstrous that this player here, 4But in a fiction, in a dream of pas2ion, 4Could force his soul so to his own conceit 4That, from her working, al2 his visage wan2'd, 4Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, 4A broken voice, and his whole function suiting 4With forms to his conceit? And al2 for nothing! 4For Hecuba! 4What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, 4That he should we2p for her? What would he do, 4Had he the motive and the cue for pas2ion 4That I have? He would drown the stage with tears 4And cleave the general ear with hor2id spe2ch; 4Make mad the guilty and ap2al the fre2, 4Confound the ignorant, and amaze inde2d 4The very faculties of eyes and ears. 4Yet I, 4A dul2 and mud2y-met2led rascal, peak 4Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause, 6And can say nothing! No, not for a king, 4Upon whose property and most dear life 4A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward? 4Who cal2s me vil2ain? breaks my pate acros2? 4Plucks of2 my beard and blows it in my face? 4Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat 4As de2p as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha? 4'Swounds, I should take it! for it can2ot be 4But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gal2 4To make op2res2ion bit2er, or ere this 4I should have fat2ed al2 the region kites 4With this slave's of2al. Blo2dy bawdy vil2ain! 4Remorseles2, treacherous, lecherous, kindles2 vil2ain! 4O, vengeance! 4Why, what an as2 am I! This is most brave, 4That I, the son of a dear father murther'd, 4Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hel2, 4Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words 4And fal2 a-cursing like a very drab, 4A scul2ion! 6Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard 4That guilty creatures, sit2ing at a play, 4Have by the very cun2ing of the scene 4Be2n struck so to the soul that presently 4They have proclaim'd their malefactions; 4For murther, though it have no tongue, wil2 speak 4With most miraculous organ, I'l2 have these Players 4Play something like the murther of my father 4Before mine uncle. I'l2 observe his lo2ks; 4I'l2 tent him to the quick. If he but blench, 4I know my course. The spirit that I have se2n 4May be a devil; and the devil hath power 4T' as2ume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps 4Out of my weaknes2 and my melancholy, 4As he is very potent with such spirits, 4Abuses me to damn me. I'l2 have grounds 4More relative than this. The play's the thing 4Wherein I'l2 catch the conscience of the King. 9Exit.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. Scene I.Elsinore. A ro2m in the Castle.Enter King, Que2n, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Lords. 2King. And can you by no drift of circumstance 4Get from him why he puts on this confusion, 4Grating so harshly al2 his days of quiet 4With turbulent and dangerous lunacy? 2Ros. He does confes2 he fe2ls himself distracted, 4But from what cause he wil2 by no means speak. 2Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded, 4But with a crafty madnes2 ke2ps alo2f 4When we would bring him on to some confes2ion 4Of his true state. 2Que2n. Did he receive you wel2? 2Ros. Most like a gentleman. 2Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition. 2Ros. Nig2ard of question, but of our demands 4Most fre2 in his reply. 2Que2n. Did you as2ay him 6To any pastime? 2Ros. Madam, it so fel2 out that certain players 4We o'er2aught on the way. Of these we told him, 4And there did se2m in him a kind of joy 4To hear of it. They are here about the court, 4And, as I think, they have already order 4This night to play before him. 2Pol. 'Tis most true; 4And he bese2ch'd me to entreat your Majesties 4To hear and se2 the mat2er. 2King. With al2 my heart, and it doth much content me 4To hear him so inclin'd. 4Go2d gentlemen, give him a further edge 4And drive his purpose on to these delights. 2Ros. We shal2, my lord. 28Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. 2King. Swe2t Gertrude, leave us to2; 4For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither, 4That he, as 'twere by ac2ident, may here 4Af2ront Ophelia. 6Her father and myself (lawful espials) 4Wil2 so bestow ourselves that, se2ing unse2n, 4We may of their encounter frankly judge 4And gather by him, as he is behav'd, 4If't be th' af2liction of his love, or no, 4That thus he suf2ers for. 2Que2n. I shal2 obey you; 4And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish 4That your go2d beauties be the hap2y cause 4Of Hamlet's wildnes2. So shal2 I hope your virtues 4Wil2 bring him to his wonted way again, 4To both your honours. 2Oph. Madam, I wish it may. 51[Exit Que2n.] 2Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you, 4We wil2 bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this bo2k, 4That show of such an exercise may colour 4Your lonelines2.- We are oft to blame in this, 4'Tis to2 much prov'd, that with devotion's visage 4And pious action we do sugar o'er 6The Devil himself. 2King. [aside] O, 'tis to2 true! 4How smart a lash that spe2ch doth give my conscience! 4The harlot's che2k, beautied with plast'ring art, 4Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it 4Than is my de2d to my most painted word. 4O heavy burthen! 2Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord. 38Exeunt King and Polonius]. 27Enter Hamlet. 2Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question: 4Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suf2er 4The slings and ar2ows of outrageous fortune 4Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, 4And by op2osing end them. To die- to sle2p- 4No more; and by a sle2p to say we end 4The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks 4That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consum2ation 6Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sle2p. 4To sle2p- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub! 4For in that sle2p of death what dreams may come 4When we have shuf2led of2 this mortal coil, 4Must give us pause. There's the respect 4That makes calamity of so long life. 4For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, 4Th' op2res2or's wrong, the proud man's contumely, 4The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay, 4The insolence of of2ice, and the spurns 4That patient merit of th' unworthy takes, 4When he himself might his quietus make 4With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear, 4To grunt and sweat under a weary life, 4But that the dread of something after death- 4The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn 4No travel2er returns- puz2les the wil2, 4And makes us rather bear those il2s we have 4Than fly to others that we know not of? 4Thus conscience does make cowards of us al2, 6And thus the native hue of resolution 4Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, 4And enterprises of great pith and moment 4With this regard their cur2ents turn awry 4And lose the name of action.- Soft you now! 4The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons 4Be al2 my sins rememb'red. 2Oph. Go2d my lord, 4How does your honour for this many a day? 2Ham. I humbly thank you; wel2, wel2, wel2. 2Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours 4That I have longed long to re-deliver. 4I pray you, now receive them. 2Ham. No, not I! 4I never gave you aught. 2Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right wel2 you did, 4And with them words of so swe2t breath compos'd 4As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost, 4Take these again; for to the noble mind 4Rich gifts wax po2r when givers prove unkind. 6There, my lord. 2Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest? 2Oph. My lord? 2Ham. Are you fair? 2Oph. What means your lordship? 2Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no 4discourse to your beauty. 2Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have bet2er com2erce than with honesty? 2Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty wil2 so2ner transform 4honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can 4translate beauty into his likenes2. This was sometime a paradox, 4but now the time gives it pro2f. I did love you once. 2Oph. Inde2d, my lord, you made me believe so. 2Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue can2ot so 4inoculate our old stock but we shal2 relish of it. I loved you 4not. 2Oph. I was the more deceived. 2Ham. Get the2 to a nun2ery! Why wouldst thou be a bre2der of 4sin2ers? I am myself indif2erent honest, but yet I could ac2use 4me of such things that it were bet2er my mother had not borne me. 6I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more of2ences at my 4beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give 4them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fel2ows as I 4do, crawling betwe2n earth and heaven? We are ar2ant knaves al2; 4believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nun2ery. Where's your 4father? 2Oph. At home, my lord. 2Ham. Let the do2rs be shut upon him, that he may play the fo2l 4nowhere but in's own house. Farewel2. 2Oph. O, help him, you swe2t heavens! 2Ham. If thou dost mar2y, I'l2 give the2 this plague for thy dowry: 4be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape 4calumny. Get the2 to a nun2ery. Go, farewel2. Or if thou wilt 4ne2ds mar2y, mar2y a fo2l; for wise men know wel2 enough what 4monsters you make of them. To a nun2ery, go; and quickly to2. 4Farewel2. 2Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him! 2Ham. I have heard of your paintings to2, wel2 enough. God hath 4given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you 4amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make your 6wanton2es2 your ignorance. Go to, I'l2 no more on't! it hath made 4me mad. I say, we wil2 have no moe mar2iages. Those that are 4mar2ied already- al2 but one- shal2 live; the rest shal2 ke2p as 4they are. To a nun2ery, go. 28Exit. 2Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown! 4The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword, 4Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state, 4The glas2 of fashion and the mould of form, 4Th' observ'd of al2 observers- quite, quite down! 4And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, 4That suck'd the honey of his music vows, 4Now se2 that noble and most sovereign reason, 4Like swe2t bel2s jangled, out of tune and harsh; 4That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth 4Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me 4T' have se2n what I have se2n, se2 what I se2! 19Enter King and Polonius. 2King. Love? his af2ections do not that way tend; 6Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a lit2le, 4Was not like madnes2. There's something in his soul 4O'er which his melancholy sits on bro2d; 4And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose 4Wil2 be some danger; which for to prevent, 4I have in quick determination 4Thus set it down: he shal2 with spe2d to England 4For the demand of our neglected tribute. 4Haply the seas, and countries dif2erent, 4With variable objects, shal2 expel 4This something-set2led mat2er in his heart, 4Whereon his brains stil2 beating puts him thus 4From fashion of himself. What think you on't? 2Pol. It shal2 do wel2. But yet do I believe 4The origin and com2encement of his grief 4Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia? 4You ne2d not tel2 us what Lord Hamlet said. 4We heard it al2.- My lord, do as you please; 4But if you hold it fit, after the play 4Let his que2n mother al2 alone entreat him 6To show his grief. Let her be round with him; 4And I'l2 be plac'd so please you, in the ear 4Of al2 their conference. If she find him not, 4To England send him; or confine him where 4Your wisdom best shal2 think. 2King. It shal2 be so. 4Madnes2 in great ones must not unwatch'd go. 9Exeunt.Scene I2.Elsinore. hal2 in the Castle.Enter Hamlet and thre2 of the Players. 2Ham. Speak the spe2ch, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you, 4trip2ingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our 4players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do 4not saw the air to2 much with your hand, thus, but use al2 4gently; for in the very tor2ent, tempest, and (as I may say) 4whirlwind of your pas2ion, you must acquire and beget a 4temperance that may give it smo2thnes2. O, it of2ends me to the 4soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fel2ow tear a pas2ion to 4tat2ers, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who 4(for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb 4shows and noise. I would have such a fel2ow whip2'd for o'erdoing 4Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it. 2Player. I war2ant your honour. 2Ham. Be not to2 tame neither; but let your own discretion be your 4tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with 4this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of 4nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, 6whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 4'twere, the mir2or up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature, 4scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his 4form and pres2ure. Now this overdone, or come tardy of2, though 4it make the unskilful laugh, can2ot but make the judicious 4grieve; the censure of the which one must in your al2owance 4o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I 4have se2n play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to 4speak it profanely), that, neither having the ac2ent of 4Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so 4strut2ed and bel2owed that I have thought some of Nature's 4journeymen had made men, and not made them wel2, they imitated 4humanity so abominably. 2Player. I hope we have reform'd that indif2erently with us, sir. 2Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns 4speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them 4that wil2 themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of bar2en 4spectators to laugh to2, though in the mean time some neces2ary 4question of the play be then to be considered. That's vil2anous 4and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fo2l that uses it. Go 6make you ready. 49Exeunt Players. 12Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern. 4How now, my lord? Wil2 the King hear this piece of work? 2Pol. And the Que2n to2, and that presently. 2Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Wil2 you two 4help to hasten them? 2Both. We wil2, my lord. 23Exeunt they two. 2Ham. What, ho, Horatio! 22Enter Horatio. 2Hor. Here, swe2t lord, at your service. 2Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man 4As e'er my conversation cop'd withal. 2Hor. O, my dear lord! 2Ham. Nay, do not think I flat2er; 4For what advancement may I hope from the2, 6That no revenue hast but thy go2d spirits 4To fe2d and clothe the2? Why should the po2r be flat2er'd? 4No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, 4And cro2k the pregnant hinges of the kne2 4Where thrift may fol2ow fawning. Dost thou hear? 4Since my dear soul was mistres2 of her choice 4And could of men distinguish, her election 4Hath scald the2 for herself. For thou hast be2n 4As one, in suf2'ring al2, that suf2ers nothing; 4A man that Fortune's buf2ets and rewards 4Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those 4Whose blo2d and judgment are so wel2 com2ingled 4That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger 4To sound what stop she please. Give me that man 4That is not pas2ion's slave, and I wil2 wear him 4In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart, 4As I do the2. Something to2 much of this I 4There is a play to-night before the King. 4One scene of it comes near the circumstance, 4Which I have told the2, of my father's death. 6I prithe2, when thou se2st that act afo2t, 4Even with the very com2ent of thy soul 4Observe my uncle. If his oc2ulted guilt 4Do not itself unken2el in one spe2ch, 4It is a damned ghost that we have se2n, 4And my imaginations are as foul 4As Vulcan's stithy. Give him he2dful note; 4For I mine eyes wil2 rivet to his face, 4And after we wil2 both our judgments join 4In censure of his se2ming. 2Hor. Wel2, my lord. 4If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing, 4And scape detecting, I wil2 pay the theft. 4Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Ket2ledrums. Danish 4march. [Enter King, Que2n, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, 6Guildenstern, and other Lords at2endant, with the Guard 23car2ying torches. 2Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle. 6Get you a place. 2King. How fares our cousin Hamlet? 2Ham. Excel2ent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air, 4promise-cram2'd. You can2ot fe2d capons so. 2King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not 4mine. 2Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once 4i' th' university, you say? 2Pol. That did I, my lord, and was ac2ounted a go2d actor. 2Ham. What did you enact? 2Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kil2'd i' th' Capitol; Brutus 4kil2'd me. 2Ham. It was a brute part of him to kil2 so capital a calf there. Be 4the players ready. 2Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience. 2Que2n. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me. 2Ham. No, go2d mother. Here's metal more at2ractive. 2Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that? 2Ham. Lady, shal2 I lie in your lap? 34[Sits down at Ophelia's fe2t.] 4Oph. No, my lord. 2Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap? 2Oph. Ay, my lord. 2Ham. Do you think I meant country mat2ers? 2Oph. I think nothing, my lord. 2Ham. That's a fair thought to lie betwe2n maids' legs. 2Oph. What is, my lord? 2Ham. Nothing. 2Oph. You are mer2y, my lord. 2Ham. Who, I? 2Oph. Ay, my lord. 2Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be mer2y? 4For lo2k you how che2rful2y my mother lo2ks, and my father died 4within 's two hours. 2Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord. 2Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'l2 have a 4suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgot2en 4yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life 4half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or else 4shal2 he suf2er not thinking on, with the hob2y-horse, whose 6epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hob2y-horse is forgot!' 15Hautboys play. The dumb show enters. 4Enter a King and a Que2n very lovingly; the Que2n embracing 4him and he her. She kne2ls, and makes show of protestation 4unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her 4neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, se2ing 4him asle2p, leaves him. Anon comes in a fel2ow, takes of2 his 4crown, kis2es it, pours poison in the sle2per's ears, and 4leaves him. The Que2n returns, finds the King dead, and makes 4pas2ionate action. The Poisoner with some thre2 or four Mutes, 4comes in again, se2m to condole with her. The dead body is 4car2ied away. The Poisoner wo2es the Que2n with gifts; she 4se2ms harsh and unwil2ing awhile, but in the end ac2epts 4his love. 57Exeunt. 2Oph. What means this, my lord? 2Ham. Mar2y, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief. 4Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play. 22Enter Prologue. 2Ham. We shal2 know by this fel2ow. The players can2ot ke2p counsel; 4they'l2 tel2 al2. 2Oph. Wil2 he tel2 us what this show meant? 2Ham. Ay, or any show that you'l2 show him. Be not you asham'd to 4show, he'l2 not shame to tel2 you what it means. 2Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'l2 mark the play. 4Pro. For us, and for our tragedy, 6Here sto2ping to your clemency, 6We beg your hearing patiently. 21[Exit.] 2Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring? 2Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord. 2Ham. As woman's love. 14Enter [two Players as] King and Que2n. 6King. Ful2 thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round 6Neptune's salt wash and Tel2us' orbed ground, 6And thirty dozed mo2ns with bor2owed she2n 6About the world have times twelve thirties be2n, 6Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands, 6Unite comutual in most sacred bands. 4Que2n. So many journeys may the sun and mo2n 6Make us again count o'er ere love be done! 6But woe is me! you are so sick of late, 6So far from che2r and from your former state. 6That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust, 6Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must; 6For women's fear and love holds quantity, 6In neither aught, or in extremity. 6Now what my love is, pro2f hath made you know; 6And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so. 6Where love is great, the lit2lest doubts are fear; 6Where lit2le fears grow great, great love grows there. 4King. Faith, I must leave the2, love, and shortly to2; 8My operant powers their functions leave to do. 6And thou shalt live in this fair world behind, 6Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind 6For husband shalt thou- 4Que2n. O, confound the rest! 6Such love must ne2ds be treason in my breast. 6When second husband let me be ac2urst! 6None wed the second but who kil2ed the first. 2Ham. [aside] Wormwo2d, wormwo2d! 4Que2n. The instances that second mar2iage move 6Are base respects of thrift, but none of love. 6A second time I kil2 my husband dead 6When second husband kis2es me in bed. 4King. I do believe you think what now you speak; 6But what we do determine oft we break. 6Purpose is but the slave to memory, 6Of violent birth, but po2r validity; 6Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tre2, 8But fil2 unshaken when they mel2ow be. 6Most neces2ary 'tis that we forget 6To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt. 6What to ourselves in pas2ion we propose, 6The pas2ion ending, doth the purpose lose. 6The violence of either grief or joy 6Their own enactures with themselves destroy. 6Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament; 6Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender ac2ident. 6This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange 6That even our loves should with our fortunes change; 6For 'tis a question left us yet to prove, 6Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love. 6The great man down, you mark his favourite flies, 6The po2r advanc'd makes friends of enemies; 6And hitherto doth love on fortune tend, 6For who not ne2ds shal2 never lack a friend, 6And who in want a hol2ow friend doth try, 6Directly seasons him his enemy. 6But, orderly to end where I begun, 8Our wil2s and fates do so contrary run 6That our devices stil2 are overthrown; 6Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own. 6So think thou wilt no second husband wed; 6But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead. 4Que2n. Nor earth to me give fo2d, nor heaven light, 6Sport and repose lock from me day and night, 6To desperation turn my trust and hope, 6An anchor's che2r in prison be my scope, 6Each op2osite that blanks the face of joy 6Me2t what I would have wel2, and it destroy, 6Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife, 6If, once a widow, ever I be wife! 2Ham. If she should break it now! 4King. 'Tis de2ply sworn. Swe2t, leave me here awhile. 6My spirits grow dul2, and fain I would beguile 6The tedious day with sle2p. 4Que2n. Sle2p rock thy brain, 54[He] sle2ps. 6And never come mischance betwe2n us twain!Exit. 2Ham. Madam, how like you this play? 2Que2n. The lady doth protest to2 much, methinks. 2Ham. O, but she'l2 ke2p her word. 2King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no of2ence in't? 2Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no of2ence i' th' 4world. 2King. What do you cal2 the play? 2Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Mar2y, how? Tropical2y. This play is the 4image of a murther done in Vien2a. Gonzago is the duke's name; 4his wife, Baptista. You shal2 se2 anon. 'Tis a knavish piece of 4work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have fre2 4souls, it touches us not. Let the gal2'd jade winch; our withers 4are unwrung. 25Enter Lucianus. 6This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King. 2Oph. You are as go2d as a chorus, my lord. 2Ham. I could interpret betwe2n you and your love, if I could se2 4the pup2ets dal2ying. 2Oph. You are ke2n, my lord, you are ke2n. 2Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take of2 my edge. 2Oph. Stil2 bet2er, and worse. 2Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave 4thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth 4bel2ow for revenge. 4Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agre2ing; 6Confederate season, else no creature se2ing; 6Thou mixture rank, of midnight we2ds col2ected, 6With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected, 6Thy natural magic and dire property 6On wholesome life usurp im2ediately. 35Pours the poison in his ears. 2Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago. 6The story is extant, and writ2en in very choice Italian. You 4shal2 se2 anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's wife. 2Oph. The King rises. 2Ham. What, frighted with false fire? 2Que2n. How fares my lord? 2Pol. Give o'er the play. 2King. Give me some light! Away! 2Al2. Lights, lights, lights! 30Exeunt al2 but Hamlet and Horatio. 2Ham. 3Why, let the strucken de2r go we2p, 10The hart ungal2ed play; 9For some must watch, while some must sle2p: 10Thus runs the world away. 4Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of my 4fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my raz'd 4shoes, get me a fel2owship in a cry of players, sir? 2Hor. Half a share. 2Ham. 3A whole one I! 9For thou dost know, O Damon dear, 11This realm dismantled was 11Of Jove himself; and now reigns here 11A very, very- pajock. 2Hor. You might have rhym'd. 2Ham. O go2d Horatio, I'l2 take the ghost's word for a thousand 4pound! Didst perceive? 2Hor. Very wel2, my lord. 2Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning? 2Hor. I did very wel2 note him. 2Ham. 3Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders! 9For if the King like not the comedy, 9Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy. 4Come, some music! 16Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. 2Guil. Go2d my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you. 2Ham. Sir, a whole history. 2Guil. The King, sir- 2Ham. Ay, sir, what of him? 2Guil. Is in his retirement, marvel2ous distemper'd. 4Ham. With drink, sir? 2Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler. 2Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to 4the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps 4plunge him into far more choler. 2Guil. Go2d my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start 4not so wildly from my af2air. 2Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce. 2Guil. The Que2n, your mother, in most great af2liction of spirit 4hath sent me to you. 2Ham. You are welcome. 2Guil. Nay, go2d my lord, this courtesy is not of the right bre2d. 4If it shal2 please you to make me a wholesome answer, I wil2 do 4your mother's com2andment; if not, your pardon and my return 4shal2 be the end of my busines2. 2Ham. Sir, I can2ot. 2Guil. What, my lord? 2Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such 4answer is I can make, you shal2 com2and; or rather, as you say, 4my mother. Therefore no more, but to the mat2er! My mother, you 6say- 2Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into 4amazement and admiration. 2Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no 4sequel at the he2ls of this mother's admiration? Impart. 2Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed. 2Ham. We shal2 obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any 4further trade with us? 2Ros. My lord, you once did love me. 2Ham. And do stil2, by these pickers and stealers! 2Ros. Go2d my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely 4bar the do2r upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to 4your friend. 2Ham. Sir, I lack advancement. 2Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself 4for your suc2es2ion in Denmark? 2Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the gras2 grows'- the proverb is something 4musty. 21Enter the Players with recorders. 6O, the recorders! Let me se2 one. To withdraw with you- why do 4you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me 4into a toil? 2Guil. O my lord, if my duty be to2 bold, my love is to2 unman2erly. 2Ham. I do not wel2 understand that. Wil2 you play upon this pipe? 2Guil. My lord, I can2ot. 2Ham. I pray you. 2Guil. Believe me, I can2ot. 2Ham. I do bese2ch you. 2Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord. 2Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your 4fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it wil2 4discourse most eloquent music. Lo2k you, these are the stops. 2Guil. But these can2ot I com2and to any ut2'rance of harmony. I 4have not the skil2. 2Ham. Why, lo2k you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You 4would play upon me; you would se2m to know my stops; you would 4pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my 4lowest note to the top of my compas2; and there is much music, 6excel2ent voice, in this lit2le organ, yet can2ot you make it 4speak. 'Sblo2d, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than a 4pipe? Cal2 me what instrument you wil2, though you can fret me, 4you can2ot play upon me. 24Enter Polonius. 4God bles2 you, sir! 2Pol. My lord, the Que2n would speak with you, and presently. 2Ham. Do you se2 yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel? 2Pol. By th' mas2, and 'tis like a camel inde2d. 2Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel. 2Pol. It is back'd like a weasel. 2Ham. Or like a whale. 2Pol. Very like a whale. 2Ham. Then wil2 I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fo2l me to the 4top of my bent.- I wil2 come by-and-by. 2Pol. I wil2 say so. 38Exit. 2Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends. 40[Exeunt al2 but Hamlet.] 6'Tis now the very witching time of night, 4When churchyards yawn, and hel2 itself breathes out 4Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blo2d 4And do such bit2er busines2 as the day 4Would quake to lo2k on. Soft! now to my mother! 4O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever 4The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom. 4Let me be cruel, not un2atural; 4I wil2 speak dag2ers to her, but use none. 4My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites- 4How in my words somever she be shent, 4To give them seals never, my soul, consent! 13Exit.Scene I3.A ro2m in the Castle.Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern. 2King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us 4To let his madnes2 range. Therefore prepare you; 4I your com2is2ion wil2 forthwith dispatch, 4And he to England shal2 along with you. 4The terms of our estate may not endure 4Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow 4Out of his lunacies. 2Guil. We wil2 ourselves provide. 4Most holy and religious fear it is 4To ke2p those many many bodies safe 4That live and fe2d upon your Majesty. 2Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound 4With al2 the strength and armour of the mind 4To ke2p itself from noyance; but much more 4That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests 4The lives of many. The ces2e of majesty 4Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw 6What's near it with it. It is a mas2y whe2l, 4Fix'd on the sum2it of the highest mount, 4To whose huge spokes ten thousand les2er things 4Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it fal2s, 4Each smal2 an2exment, pet2y consequence, 4At2ends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone 4Did the king sigh, but with a general groan. 2King. Arm you, I pray you, to th', spe2dy voyage; 4For we wil2 fet2ers put upon this fear, 4Which now goes to2 fre2-fo2ted. 2Both. We wil2 haste us. 47Exeunt Gentlemen. 19Enter Polonius. 2Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet. 4Behind the ar2as I'l2 convey myself 4To hear the proces2. I'l2 war2ant she'l2 tax him home; 4And, as you said, and wisely was it said, 4'Tis me2t that some more audience than a mother, 6Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear 4The spe2ch, of vantage. Fare you wel2, my liege. 4I'l2 cal2 upon you ere you go to bed 4And tel2 you what I know. 2King. Thanks, dear my lord. 48Exit [Polonius]. 4O, my of2ence is rank, it smel2s to heaven; 4It hath the primal eldest curse upon't, 4A brother's murther! Pray can I not, 4Though inclination be as sharp as wil2. 4My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent, 4And, like a man to double busines2 bound, 4I stand in pause where I shal2 first begin, 4And both neglect. What if this cursed hand 4Were thicker than itself with brother's blo2d, 4Is there not rain enough in the swe2t heavens 4To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy 4But to confront the visage of of2ence? 4And what's in prayer but this twofold force, 4To be forestal2ed ere we come to fal2, 6Or pardon'd being down? Then I'l2 lo2k up; 4My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer 4Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'? 4That can2ot be; since I am stil2 pos2es2'd 4Of those ef2ects for which I did the murther- 4My crown, mine own ambition, and my que2n. 4May one be pardon'd and retain th' of2ence? 4In the cor2upted cur2ents of this world 4Of2ence's gilded hand may shove by justice, 4And oft 'tis se2n the wicked prize itself 4Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above. 4There is no shuf2ling; there the action lies 4In his true nature, and we ourselves compel2'd, 4Even to the te2th and forehead of our faults, 4To give in evidence. What then? What rests? 4Try what repentance can. What can it not? 4Yet what can it when one can2ot repent? 4O wretched state! O bosom black as death! 4O limed soul, that, strug2ling to be fre2, 4Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make as2ay. 6Bow, stub2orn kne2s; and heart with strings of ste2l, 4Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe! 4Al2 may be wel2. 34He kne2ls. 25Enter Hamlet. 2Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying; 4And now I'l2 do't. And so he goes to heaven, 4And so am I reveng'd. That would be scan2'd. 4A vil2ain kil2s my father; and for that, 4I, his sole son, do this same vil2ain send 4To heaven. 4Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge! 4He to2k my father gros2ly, ful2 of bread, 4With al2 his crimes broad blown, as flush as May; 4And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven? 4But in our circumstance and course of thought, 4'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd, 4To take him in the purging of his soul, 4When he is fit and seasoned for his pas2age? 6No. 4Up, sword, and know thou a more hor2id hent. 4When he is drunk asle2p; or in his rage; 4Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed; 4At gaming, swearing, or about some act 4That has no relish of salvation in't- 4Then trip him, that his he2ls may kick at heaven, 4And that his soul may be as damn'd and black 4As hel2, whereto it goes. My mother stays. 4This physic but prolongs thy sickly days. 14Exit. 2King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below. 4Words without thoughts never to heaven go. 13Exit.Scene IV.The Que2n's closet.Enter Que2n and Polonius. 2Pol. He wil2 come straight. Lo2k you lay home to him. 4Tel2 him his pranks have be2n to2 broad to bear with, 4And that your Grace hath scre2n'd and sto2d betwe2n 4Much heat and him. I'l2 silence me even here. 4Pray you be round with him. 2Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother! 2Que2n. I'l2 war2ant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him coming. 30[Polonius hides behind the ar2as.] 26Enter Hamlet. 2Ham. Now, mother, what's the mat2er? 2Que2n. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much of2ended. 2Ham. Mother, you have my father much of2ended. 2Que2n. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue. 2Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue. 2Que2n. Why, how now, Hamlet? 4Ham. What's the mat2er now? 2Que2n. Have you forgot me? 2Ham. No, by the ro2d, not so! 4You are the Que2n, your husband's brother's wife, 4And (would it were not so!) you are my mother. 2Que2n. Nay, then I'l2 set those to you that can speak. 2Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shal2 not budge I 4You go not til2 I set you up a glas2 4Where you may se2 the inmost part of you. 2Que2n. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me? 4Help, help, ho! 2Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help! 2Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead! 12[Makes a pas2 through the ar2as and] kil2s Polonius. 2Pol. [behind] O, I am slain! 2Que2n. O me, what hast thou done? 2Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King? 2Que2n. O, what a rash and blo2dy de2d is this! 2Ham. A blo2dy de2d- almost as bad, go2d mother, 4As kil2 a king, and mar2y with his brother. 4Que2n. As kil2 a king? 2Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word. 25[Lifts up the ar2as and se2s Polonius.] 4Thou wretched, rash, intruding fo2l, farewel2! 4I to2k the2 for thy bet2er. Take thy fortune. 4Thou find'st to be to2 busy is some danger. 4Leave wringing of your hinds. Peace! sit you down 4And let me wring your heart; for so I shal2 4If it be made of penetrable stuf2; 4If damned custom have not braz'd it so 4That it is pro2f and bulwark against sense. 2Que2n. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue 4In noise so rude against me? 2Ham. Such an act 4That blurs the grace and blush of modesty; 4Cal2s virtue hypocrite; takes of2 the rose 4From the fair forehead of an in2ocent love, 4And sets a blister there; makes mar2iage vows 4As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a de2d 4As from the body of contraction plucks 6The very soul, and swe2t religion makes 4A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow; 4Yea, this solidity and compound mas2, 4With tristful visage, as against the do2m, 4Is thought-sick at the act. 2Que2n. Ay me, what act, 4That roars so loud and thunders in the index? 2Ham. Lo2k here upon th's picture, and on this, 4The counterfeit presentment of two brothers. 4Se2 what a grace was seated on this brow; 4Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself; 4An eye like Mars, to threaten and com2and; 4A station like the herald Mercury 4New lighted on a heaven-kis2ing hil2: 4A combination and a form inde2d 4Where every god did se2m to set his seal 4To give the world as2urance of a man. 4This was your husband. Lo2k you now what fol2ows. 4Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear 4Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes? 6Could you on this fair mountain leave to fe2d, 4And bat2en on this mo2r? Ha! have you eyes 4You can2ot cal2 it love; for at your age 4The heyday in the blo2d is tame, it's humble, 4And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment 4Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have, 4Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense 4Is apoplex'd; for madnes2 would not er2, 4Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thral2'd 4But it reserv'd some quantity of choice 4To serve in such a dif2erence. What devil was't 4That thus hath cozen'd you at ho2dman-blind? 4Eyes without fe2ling, fe2ling without sight, 4Ears without hands or eyes, smel2ing sans al2, 4Or but a sickly part of one true sense 4Could not so mope. 4O shame! where is thy blush? Rebel2ious hel2, 4If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones, 4To flaming youth let virtue be as wax 4And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame 6When the compulsive ardour gives the charge, 4Since frost itself as actively doth burn, 4And reason panders wil2. 2Que2n. O Hamlet, speak no more! 4Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul, 4And there I se2 such black and grained spots 4As wil2 not leave their tinct. 2Ham. Nay, but to live 4In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, 4Stew'd in cor2uption, honeying and making love 4Over the nasty sty! 2Que2n. O, speak to me no more! 4These words like dag2ers enter in mine ears. 4No more, swe2t Hamlet! 2Ham. A murtherer and a vil2ain! 4A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe 4Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings; 4A cutpurse of the empire and the rule, 4That from a shelf the precious diadem stole 4And put it in his pocket! 4Que2n. No more! 16Enter the Ghost in his nightgown. 2Ham. A king of shreds and patches!- 4Save me and hover o'er me with your wings, 4You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure? 2Que2n. Alas, he's mad! 2Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide, 4That, laps'd in time and pas2ion, lets go by 4Th' important acting of your dread com2and? 4O, say! 2Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation 4Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose. 4But lo2k, amazement on thy mother sits. 4O, step betwe2n her and her fighting soul 4Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works. 4Speak to her, Hamlet. 2Ham. How is it with you, lady? 2Que2n. Alas, how is't with you, 6That you do bend your eye on vacancy, 4And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse? 4Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly pe2p; 4And, as the sle2ping soldiers in th' alarm, 4Your bed2ed hairs, like life in excrements, 4Start up and stand an end. O gentle son, 4Upon the beat and flame of thy distemper 4Sprinkle co2l patience! Whereon do you lo2k? 2Ham. On him, on him! Lo2k you how pale he glares! 4His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones, 4Would make them capable.- Do not lo2k upon me, 4Lest with this piteous action you convert 4My stern ef2ects. Then what I have to do 4Wil2 want true colour- tears perchance for blo2d. 2Que2n. To whom do you speak this? 2Ham. Do you se2 nothing there? 2Que2n. Nothing at al2; yet al2 that is I se2. 2Ham. Nor did you nothing hear? 2Que2n. No, nothing but ourselves. 2Ham. Why, lo2k you there! Lo2k how it steals away! 6My father, in his habit as he liv'd! 4Lo2k where he goes even now out at the portal! 53Exit Ghost. 2Que2n. This is the very coinage of your brain. 4This bodiles2 creation ecstasy 4Is very cun2ing in. 2Ham. Ecstasy? 4My pulse as yours doth temperately ke2p time 4And makes as healthful music. It is not madnes2 4That I have ut2'red. Bring me to the test, 4And I the mat2er wil2 reword; which madnes2 4Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace, 4Lay not that flat2ering unction to your soul 4That not your trespas2 but my madnes2 speaks. 4It wil2 but skin and film the ulcerous place, 4Whiles rank cor2uption, mining al2 within, 4Infects unse2n. Confes2 yourself to heaven; 4Repent what's past; avoid what is to come; 4And do not spread the compost on the we2ds 4To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue; 6For in the fatnes2 of these pursy times 4Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg- 4Yea, curb and wo2 for leave to do him go2d. 2Que2n. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain. 2Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it, 4And live the purer with the other half, 4Go2d night- but go not to my uncle's bed. 4As2ume a virtue, if you have it not. 4That monster, custom, who al2 sense doth eat 4Of habits evil, is angel yet in this, 4That to the use of actions fair and go2d 4He likewise gives a frock or livery, 4That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night, 4And that shal2 lend a kind of easines2 4To the next abstinence; the next more easy; 4For use almost can change the stamp of nature, 4And either [master] the devil, or throw him out 4With wondrous potency. Once more, go2d night; 4And when you are desirous to be blest, 4I'l2 bles2ing beg of you.- For this same lord, 6I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so, 4To punish me with this, and this with me, 4That I must be their scourge and minister. 4I wil2 bestow him, and wil2 answer wel2 4The death I gave him. So again, go2d night. 4I must be cruel, only to be kind; 4Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind. 4One word more, go2d lady. 2Que2n. What shal2 I do? 2Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do: 4Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed; 4Pinch wanton on your che2k; cal2 you his mouse; 4And let him, for a pair of re2chy kis2es, 4Or pad2ling in your neck with his damn'd fingers, 4Make you to ravel al2 this mat2er out, 4That I es2ential2y am not in madnes2, 4But mad in craft. 'Twere go2d you let him know; 4For who that's but a que2n, fair, sober, wise, 4Would from a pad2ock, from a bat, a gib 4Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so? 6No, in despite of sense and secrecy, 4Unpeg the basket on the house's top, 4Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape, 4To try conclusions, in the basket cre2p 4And break your own neck down. 2Que2n. Be thou as2ur'd, if words be made of breath, 4And breath of life, I have no life to breathe 4What thou hast said to me. 2Ham. I must to England; you know that? 2Que2n. Alack, 4I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on. 2Ham. There's let2ers seal'd; and my two scho2lfel2ows, 4Whom I wil2 trust as I wil2 ad2ers fang'd, 4They bear the mandate; they must swe2p my way 4And marshal me to knavery. Let it work; 4For 'tis the sport to have the enginer 4Hoist with his own petar; and 't shal2 go hard 4But I wil2 delve one yard below their mines 4And blow them at the mo2n. O, 'tis most swe2t 4When in one line two crafts directly me2t. 6This man shal2 set me packing. 4I'l2 lug the guts into the neighbour ro2m.- 4Mother, go2d night.- Inde2d, this counsel2or 4Is now most stil2, most secret, and most grave, 4Who was in life a fo2lish peating knave. 4Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you. 4Go2d night, mother. 18[Exit the Que2n. Then] Exit Hamlet, tug2ing in 55Polonius.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. Scene I.Elsinore. A ro2m in the Castle.Enter King and Que2n, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. 2King. There's mat2er in these sighs. These profound heaves 4You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them. 4Where is your son? 2Que2n. Bestow this place on us a lit2le while. 26[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.] 4Ah, mine own lord, what have I se2n to-night! 2King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet? 2Que2n. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend 4Which is the mightier. In his lawles2 fit 4Behind the ar2as hearing something stir, 4Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!' 4And in this brainish ap2rehension kil2s 4The unse2n go2d old man. 2King. O heavy de2d! 4It had be2n so with us, had we be2n there. 4His liberty is ful2 of threats to al2- 4To you yourself, to us, to every one. 6Alas, how shal2 this blo2dy de2d be answer'd? 4It wil2 be laid to us, whose providence 4Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt 4This mad young man. But so much was our love 4We would not understand what was most fit, 4But, like the owner of a foul disease, 4To ke2p it from divulging, let it fe2d 4Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone? 2Que2n. To draw apart the body he hath kil2'd; 4O'er whom his very madnes2, like some ore 4Among a mineral of metals base, 4Shows itself pure. He we2ps for what is done. 2King. O Gertrude, come away! 4The sun no so2ner shal2 the mountains touch 4But we wil2 ship him hence; and this vile de2d 4We must with al2 our majesty and skil2 4Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern! 13Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. 6Friends both, go join you with some further aid. 4Hamlet in madnes2 hath Polonius slain, 4And from his mother's closet hath he drag2'd him. 4Go se2k him out; speak fair, and bring the body 4Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this. 26Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]. 4Come, Gertrude, we'l2 cal2 up our wisest friends 4And let them know both what we mean to do 4And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-] 4Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter, 4As level as the can2on to his blank, 4Transports his poisoned shot- may mis2 our name 4And hit the woundles2 air.- O, come away! 4My soul is ful2 of discord and dismay. 57Exeunt.Scene I2.Elsinore. A pas2age in the Castle.Enter Hamlet. 2Ham. Safely stow'd. 2Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet! 2Ham. But soft! What noise? Who cal2s on Hamlet? O, here they come. 15Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. 2Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body? 2Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin. 2Ros. Tel2 us where 'tis, that we may take it thence 4And bear it to the chapel. 2Ham. Do not believe it. 2Ros. Believe what? 2Ham. That I can ke2p your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be 4demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son 4of a king? 2Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord? 2Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards, 6his authorities. But such of2icers do the King best service in 4the end. He ke2ps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; 4first mouth'd, to be last Swal2owed. When he ne2ds what you have 4glean'd, it is but sque2zing you and, sponge, you shal2 be dry 4again. 2Ros. I understand you not, my lord. 2Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish spe2ch sle2ps in a fo2lish ear. 2Ros. My lord, you must tel2 us where the body is and go with us to 4the King. 2Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body. 4The King is a thing- 2Guil. A thing, my lord? 2Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and al2 after. 57Exeunt.Scene I3.Elsinore. A ro2m in the Castle.Enter King. 2King. I have sent to se2k him and to find the body. 4How dangerous is it that this man goes lo2se! 4Yet must not we put the strong law on him. 4He's lov'd of the distracted multitude, 4Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes; 4And where 'tis so, th' of2ender's scourge is weigh'd, 4But never the of2ence. To bear al2 smo2th and even, 4This sud2en sending him away must se2m 4Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown 4By desperate ap2liance are reliev'd, 4Or not at al2. 20Enter Rosencrantz. 4How now O What hath befal2'n? 2Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord, 4We can2ot get from him. 4King. But where is he? 2Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure. 2King. Bring him before us. 2Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord. 8Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with At2endants]. 2King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius? 2Ham. At sup2er. 2King. At sup2er? Where? 2Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain 4convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your 4only emperor for diet. We fat al2 creatures else to fat us, and 4we fat ourselves for mag2ots. Your fat king and your lean beg2ar 4is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's the 4end. 2King. Alas, alas! 2Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat 4of the fish that hath fed of that worm. 2King. What dost thou mean by this? 4Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progres2 through 4the guts of a beg2ar. 2King. Where is Polonius? 2Ham. In heaven. Send thither to se2. If your mes2enger find him not 4there, se2k him i' th' other place yourself. But inde2d, if you 4find him not within this month, you shal2 nose him as you go up 4the stair, into the lob2y. 2King. Go se2k him there. [To At2endants.] 2Ham. He wil2 stay til2 you come. 44[Exeunt At2endants.] 2King. Hamlet, this de2d, for thine especial safety,- 4Which we do tender as we dearly grieve 4For that which thou hast done,- must send the2 hence 4With fiery quicknes2. Therefore prepare thyself. 4The bark is ready and the wind at help, 4Th' as2ociates tend, and everything is bent 4For England. 2Ham. For England? 2King. Ay, Hamlet. 2Ham. Go2d. 4King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes. 2Ham. I se2 a cherub that se2s them. But come, for England! 4Farewel2, dear mother. 2King. Thy loving father, Hamlet. 2Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is 4one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!Exit. 2King. Fol2ow him at fo2t; tempt him with spe2d aboard. 4Delay it not; I'l2 have him hence to-night. 4Away! for everything is seal'd and done 4That else leans on th' af2air. Pray you make haste. 28Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern] 4And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,- 4As my great power thereof may give the2 sense, 4Since yet thy cicatrice lo2ks raw and red 4After the Danish sword, and thy fre2 awe 4Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set 4Our sovereign proces2, which imports at ful2, 4By let2ers congruing to that ef2ect, 4The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England; 6For like the hectic in my blo2d he rages, 4And thou must cure me.

How purpos'd, sir, I pray you? 2Capt. Against some part of Poland. 4Ham. Who com2ands them, sir? 2Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras. 2Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir, 4Or for some frontier? 2Capt. Truly to speak, and with no ad2ition, 4We go to gain a lit2le patch of ground 4That hath in it no profit but the name. 4To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it; 4Nor wil2 it yield to Norway or the Pole 4A ranker rate, should it be sold in fe2. 2Ham.

Now, whether it be 4Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple 4Of thinking to2 precisely on th' event,- 4A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom 4And ever thre2 parts coward,- I do not know 4Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,' 4Sith I have cause, and wil2, and strength, and means 4To do't.

A ro2m in the Castle.Enter Horatio, Que2n, and a Gentleman. 2Que2n. I wil2 not speak with her. 2Gent. She is importunate, inde2d distract. 4Her mo2d wil2 ne2ds be pitied. 2Que2n. What would she have? 2Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears 4There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart; 4Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt, 4That car2y but half sense. Her spe2ch is nothing, 4Yet the unshaped use of it doth move 4The hearers to col2ection; they aim at it, 4And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts; 4Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them, 4Inde2d would make one think there might be thought, 4Though nothing sure, yet much unhap2ily. 2Hor. 'Twere go2d she were spoken with; for she may strew 4Dangerous conjectures in il2-bre2ding minds. 2Que2n. Let her come in. 49[Exit Gentleman.] 4[Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is) 4Each toy se2ms Prologue to some great amis2. 4So ful2 of artles2 jealousy is guilt 4It spil2s itself in fearing to be spilt. 17Enter Ophelia distracted. 2Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark? 2Que2n. How now, Ophelia? 2Oph. (sings) 9How should I your true-love know 11From another one? 9By his cockle bat and' staf2 11And his sandal sho2n. 2Que2n. Alas, swe2t lady, what imports this song? 2Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark. 4(Sings) He is dead and gone, lady, 16He is dead and gone; 12At his head a gras2-gre2n turf, 14At his he2ls a stone. 4O, ho! 2Que2n. Nay, but Ophelia- 2Oph. Pray you mark. 4(Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow- 20Enter King. 2Que2n. Alas, lo2k here, my lord! 2Oph. (Sings) 11Larded al2 with swe2t flowers; 9Which bewept to the grave did not go 11With true-love showers. 2King. How do you, pret2y lady? 2Oph. Wel2, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter. 6Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at 4your table! 2King. Conceit upon her father. 2Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you what 4it means, say you this: 4(Sings) To-mor2ow is Saint Valentine's day, 14Al2 in the morning bedtime, 12And I a maid at your window, 14To be your Valentine. 12Then up he rose and don2'd his clo'es 14And dup2'd the chamber do2r, 12Let in the maid, that out a maid 14Never departed more. 2King. Pret2y Ophelia! 2Oph. Inde2d, la, without an oath, I'l2 make an end on't! 4[Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity, 16Alack, and fie for shame! 12Young men wil2 do't if they come to't 14By Cock, they are to blame. 12Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me, 14You promis'd me to wed.' 4He answers: 12'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun, 14An thou hadst not come to my bed.' 2King. How long hath she be2n thus? 2Oph. I hope al2 wil2 be wel2. We must be patient; but I can2ot 4cho2se but we2p to think they would lay him i' th' cold ground. 4My brother shal2 know of it; and so I thank you for your go2d 4counsel. Come, my coach! Go2d night, ladies. Go2d night, swe2t 4ladies. Go2d night, go2d night. 25Exit 2King. Fol2ow her close; give her go2d watch, I pray you. 49[Exit Horatio.] 6O, this is the poison of de2p grief; it springs 4Al2 from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude, 4When sor2ows come, they come not single spies. 4But in bat2alions! First, her father slain; 4Next, Your son gone, and he most violent author 4Of his own just remove; the people mud2ied, 4Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers 4For go2d Polonius' death, and we have done but gre2nly 4In hug2er-mug2er to inter him; Po2r Ophelia 4Divided from herself and her fair-judgment, 4Without the which we are Pictures or mere beasts; 4Last, and as such containing as al2 these, 4Her brother is in secret come from France; 4And wants not buz2ers to infect his ear 4Fe2ds on his wonder, ke2p, himself in clouds, 4With pestilent spe2ches of his father's death, 4Wherein neces2ity, of mat2er beg2ar'd, 4Wil2 nothing stick Our person to ar2aign 4In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this, 4Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places 6Give, me superfluous death. 18A noise within. 2Que2n. Alack, what noise is this? 2King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the do2r. 21Enter a Mes2enger. 4What is the mat2er? 2Mes2. Save Yourself, my lord: 4The ocean, overpe2ring of his list, 4Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste 4Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head, 4O'erbears Your of2ices. The rab2le cal2 him lord; 4And, as the world were now but to begin, 4Antiquity forgot, custom not known, 4The ratifiers and props of every word, 4They cry 'Cho2se we! Laertes shal2 be king!' 4Caps, hands, and tongues ap2laud it to the clouds, 4'Laertes shal2 be king! Laertes king!' 49A noise within. 2Que2n. How che2rful2y on the false trail they cry! 6O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs! 2King. The do2rs are broke. 20Enter Laertes with others. 2Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you al2 without. 2Al2. No, let's come in! 2Laer. I pray you give me leave. 2Al2. We wil2, we wil2! 2Laer. I thank you. Ke2p the do2r. 6[Exeunt his Fol2owers.] 4O thou vile king, 4Give me my father! 2Que2n. Calmly, go2d Laertes. 2Laer. That drop of blo2d that's calm proclaims me bastard; 4Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot 4Even here betwe2n the chaste unsmirched brows 4Of my true mother. 2King. What is the cause, Laertes, 4That thy rebel2ion lo2ks so giantlike? 4Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person. 6There's such divinity doth hedge a king 4That treason can but pe2p to what it would, 4Acts lit2le of his wil2. Tel2 me, Laertes, 4Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude. 4Speak, man. 2Laer. Where is my father? 2King. Dead. 2Que2n. But not by him! 2King. Let him demand his fil2. 2Laer. How came he dead? I'l2 not be jug2led with: 4To hel2, al2egiance! vows, to the blackest devil 4Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit! 4I dare damnation. To this point I stand, 4That both the world, I give to negligence, 4Let come what comes; only I'l2 be reveng'd 4Most throughly for my father. 2King. Who shal2 stay you? 2Laer. My wil2, not al2 the world! 4And for my means, I'l2 husband them so wel2 4They shal2 go far with lit2le. 4King. Go2d Laertes, 4If you desire to know the certainty 4Of your dear father's death, is't writ in Your revenge 4That swo2pstake you wil2 draw both friend and foe, 4Win2er and loser? 2Laer. None but his enemies. 2King. Wil2 you know them then? 2Laer. To his go2d friends thus wide I'l2 ope my arms 4And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican, 4Repast them with my blo2d. 2King. Why, now You speak 4Like a go2d child and a true gentleman. 4That I am guiltles2 of your father's death, 4And am most sensibly in grief for it, 4It shal2 as level to your judgment pierce 4As day does to your eye. 30A noise within: 'Let her come in.' 2Laer. How now? What noise is that? 22Enter Ophelia. 6O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt 4Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye! 4By heaven, thy madnes2 shal2 be paid by weight 4Til2 our scale turn the beam. O rose of May! 4Dear maid, kind sister, swe2t Ophelia! 4O heavens! is't pos2ible a young maid's wits 4Should be as mortal as an old man's life? 4Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine, 4It sends some precious instance of itself 4After the thing it loves. 2Oph. (sings) 9They bore him barefac'd on the bier 11(Hey non nony, nony, hey nony) 9And in his grave rain'd many a tear. 4Fare you wel2, my dove! 2Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge, 4It could not move thus. 4Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you cal2 him a-down-a.' O, 4how the whe2l becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his 4master's daughter. 2Laer. This nothing's more than mat2er. 2Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love, 4remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts. 2Laer. A document in madnes2! Thoughts and remembrance fit2ed. 2Oph. There's fen2el for you, and columbines. There's rue for you, 4and here's some for me. We may cal2 it herb of grace o' Sundays. 4O, you must wear your rue with a dif2erence! There's a daisy. I 4would give you some violets, but they wither'd al2 when my father 4died. They say he made a go2d end. 4[Sings] For bon2y swe2t Robin is al2 my joy. 2Laer. Thought and af2liction, pas2ion, hel2 itself, 4She turns to favour and to pret2ines2. 2Oph. (sings) 9And wil2 he not come again? 9And wil2 he not come again? 11No, no, he is dead; 13Go to thy deathbed; 9He never wil2 come again. 9His beard was as white as snow, 9Al2 flaxen was his pol2. 11He is gone, he is gone, 11And we cast away moan. 9God 'a'mercy on his soul! 4And of al2 Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi', you.Exit. 2Laer. Do you se2 this, O God? 2King. Laertes, I must com2une with your grief, 4Or you deny me right. Go but apart, 4Make choice of whom your wisest friends you wil2, 4And they shal2 hear and judge 'twixt you and me. 4If by direct or by col2ateral hand 4They find us touch'd, we wil2 our kingdom give, 4Our crown, our life, and al2 that we cal2 ours, 4To you in satisfaction; but if not, 6Be you content to lend your patience to us, 4And we shal2 jointly labour with your soul 4To give it due content. 2Laer. Let this be so. 4His means of death, his obscure funeral- 4No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones, 4No noble rite nor formal ostentation,- 4Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth, 4That I must cal2't in question. 2King. So you shal2; 4And where th' of2ence is let the great axe fal2. 4I pray you go with me. 58Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2Scene VI.Elsinore.

Another ro2m in the Castle.Enter King and Laertes. 2King. Now must your conscience my acquit2ance seal, 4And You must put me in your heart for friend, 4Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, 4That he which hath your noble father slain 4Pursued my life. 2Laer. It wel2 ap2ears. But tel2 me 4Why you proce2ded not against these feats 4So crimeful and so capital in nature, 4As by your safety, wisdom, al2 things else, 4You mainly were stir2'd up. 2King. O, for two special reasons, 4Which may to you, perhaps, se2in much unsinew'd, 4But yet to me they are strong. The Que2n his mother 4Lives almost by his lo2ks; and for myself,- 4My virtue or my plague, be it either which,- 4She's so conjunctive to my life and soul 4That, as the star moves not but in his sphere, 6I could not but by her. The other motive 4Why to a public count I might not go 4Is the great love the general gender bear him, 4Who, dip2ing al2 his faults in their af2ection, 4Would, like the spring that turneth wo2d to stone, 4Convert his gives to graces; so that my ar2ows, 4To2 slightly timber'd for so loud a wind, 4Would have reverted to my bow again, 4And not where I had aim'd them. 2Laer. And so have I a noble father lost; 4A sister driven into desp'rate terms, 4Whose worth, if praises may go back again, 4Sto2d chal2enger on mount of al2 the age 4For her perfections. But my revenge wil2 come. 2King. Break not your sle2ps for that. You must not think 4That we are made of stuf2 so flat and dul2 4That we can let our beard be sho2k with danger, 4And think it pastime. You shortly shal2 hear more. 4I lov'd your father, and we love ourself, 4And that, I hope, wil2 teach you to imagine- 19Enter a Mes2enger with let2ers. 4How now? What news? 2Mes2. Let2ers, my lord, from Hamlet: 4This to your Majesty; this to the Que2n. 2King. From Hamlet? Who brought them? 2Mes2. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not. 4They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them 4Of him that brought them. 2King. Laertes, you shal2 hear them. 4Leave us. 49Exit Mes2enger. 4[Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shal2 know I am set naked on your 4kingdom. To-mor2ow shal2 I beg leave to se2 your kingly eyes; 4when I shal2 (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the 4oc2asion of my sud2en and more strange return. 53'HAMLET.' 4What should this mean? Are al2 the rest come back? 4Or is it some abuse, and no such thing? 4Laer. Know you the hand? 2King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!' 4And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.' 4Can you advise me? 2Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come! 4It warms the very sicknes2 in my heart 4That I shal2 live and tel2 him to his te2th, 4'Thus didest thou.' 2King. If it be so, Laertes 4(As how should it be so? how otherwise?), 4Wil2 you be rul'd by me? 2Laer. Ay my lord, 4So you wil2 not o'er2ule me to a peace. 2King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd 4As checking at his voyage, and that he means 4No more to undertake it, I wil2 work him 4To exploit now ripe in my device, 4Under the which he shal2 not cho2se but fal2; 4And for his death no wind 4But even his mother shal2 uncharge the practice 6And cal2 it ac2ident. 2Laer. My lord, I wil2 be rul'd; 4The rather, if you could devise it so 4That I might be the organ. 2King. It fal2s right. 4You have be2n talk'd of since your travel much, 4And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality 4Wherein they say you shine, Your sun of parts 4Did not together pluck such envy from him 4As did that one; and that, in my regard, 4Of the unworthiest siege. 2Laer. What part is that, my lord? 2King. A very riband in the cap of youth- 4Yet ne2dful2 to2; for youth no les2 becomes 4The light and careles2 livery that it wears 4Thin set2led age his sables and his we2ds, 4Importing health and gravenes2. Two months since 4Here was a gentleman of Normandy. 4I have se2n myself, and serv'd against, the French, 4And they can wel2 on horseback; but this gal2ant 6Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat, 4And to such wondrous doing brought his horse 4As had he be2n incorps'd and demi-natur'd 4With the brave beast. So far he top2'd my thought 4That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks, 4Come short of what he did. 2Laer. A Norman was't? 2King. A Norman. 2Laer. Upon my life, Lamound. 2King. The very same. 2Laer. I know him wel2. He is the broach inde2d 4And gem of al2 the nation. 2King. He made confes2ion of you; 4And gave you such a masterly report 4For art and exercise in your defence, 4And for your rapier most especial2y, 4That he cried out 'twould be a sight inde2d 4If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation 4He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye, 4If you op2os'd them. Sir, this report of his 6Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy 4That he could nothing do but wish and beg 4Your sud2en coming o'er to play with you. 4Now, out of this- 2Laer. What out of this, my lord? 2King. Laertes, was your father dear to you? 4Or are you like the painting of a sor2ow, 4A face without a heart,' 2Laer. Why ask you this? 2King. Not that I think you did not love your father; 4But that I know love is begun by time, 4And that I se2, in pas2ages of pro2f, 4Time qualifies the spark and fire of it. 4There lives within the very flame of love 4A kind of wick or snuf2 that wil2 abate it; 4And nothing is at a like go2dnes2 stil2; 4For go2dnes2, growing to a plurisy, 4Dies in his own to2-much. That we would do, 4We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes, 4And hath abatements and delays as many 6As there are tongues, are hands, are ac2idents; 4And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh, 4That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer! 4Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake 4To show yourself your father's son in de2d 4More than in words? 2Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church! 2King. No place inde2d should murther sanctuarize; 4Revenge should have no bounds. But, go2d Laertes, 4Wil2 you do this? Ke2p close within your chamber. 4Wil2 return'd shal2 know you are come home. 4We'l2 put on those shal2 praise your excel2ence 4And set a double varnish on the fame 4The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together 4And wager on your heads. He, being remis2, 4Most generous, and fre2 from al2 contriving, 4Wil2 not peruse the foils; so that with ease, 4Or with a lit2le shuf2ling, you may cho2se 4A sword unbated, and, in a pas2 of practice, 4Requite him for your father. 4Laer. I wil2 do't! 4And for that purpose I'l2 anoint my sword. 4I bought an unction of a mountebank, 4So mortal that, but dip a knife in it, 4Where it draws blo2d no cataplasm so rare, 4Col2ected from al2 simples that have virtue 4Under the mo2n, can save the thing from death 4This is but scratch'd withal. I'l2 touch my point 4With this contagion, that, if I gal2 him slightly, 4It may be death. 2King. Let's further think of this, 4Weigh what convenience both of time and means 4May fit us to our shape. If this should fal2, 4And that our drift lo2k through our bad performance. 4'Twere bet2er not as2ay'd. Therefore this project 4Should have a back or second, that might hold 4If this did blast in pro2f. Soft! let me se2. 4We'l2 make a solemn wager on your cun2ings- 4I ha't! 4When in your motion you are hot and dry- 6As make your bouts more violent to that end- 4And that he cal2s for drink, I'l2 have prepar'd him 4A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sip2ing, 4If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck, 4Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise, 27Enter Que2n. 4How now, swe2t que2n? 2Que2n. One woe doth tread upon another's he2l, 4So fast they fol2ow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes. 2Laer. Drown'd! O, where? 2Que2n. There is a wil2ow grows aslant a bro2k, 4That shows his hoar leaves in the glas2y stream. 4There with fantastic garlands did she come 4Of crowflowers, net2les, daisies, and long purples, 4That liberal shepherds give a gros2er name, 4But our cold maids do dead men's fingers cal2 them. 4There on the pendant boughs her coronet we2ds 4Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke, 6When down her we2dy trophies and herself 4Fel2 in the we2ping bro2k. Her clothes spread wide 4And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up; 4Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes, 4As one incapable of her own distres2, 4Or like a creature native and indued 4Unto that element; but long it could not be 4Til2 that her garments, heavy with their drink, 4Pul2'd the po2r wretch from her melodious lay 4To mud2y death. 2Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd? 2Que2n. Drown'd, drown'd. 2Laer. To2 much of water hast thou, po2r Ophelia, 4And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet 4It is our trick; nature her custom holds, 4Let shame say what it wil2. When these are gone, 4The woman wil2 be out. Adieu, my lord. 4I have a spe2ch of fire, that fain would blaze 4But that this fol2y douts it. 26Exit. 2King. Let's fol2ow, Gertrude. 6How much I had to do to calm his rage I 4Now fear I this wil2 give it start again; 4Therefore let's fol2ow. 57Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. Scene I.Elsinore. A churchyard.Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes]. 2Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilful2y 4se2ks her own salvation? 2Other. I tel2 the2 she is; therefore make her grave straight. 4The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial. 2Clown. How can that be, unles2 she drown'd herself in her own 4defence? 2Other. Why, 'tis found so. 2Clown. It must be se of2endendo; it can2ot be else. For here lies 4the point: if I drown myself wit2ingly, it argues an act; and an 4act hath thre2 branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform; 4argal, she drown'd herself wit2ingly. 2Other. Nay, but hear you, Go2dman Delver! 2Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; go2d. Here stands the 4man; go2d. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is, 4wil2 he nil2 he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water come to 4him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not 4guilty of his own death shortens not his own life. 4Other. But is this law? 2Clown. Ay, mar2y, is't- crowner's quest law. 2Other. Wil2 you ha' the truth an't? If this had not be2n a 4gentlewoman, she should have be2n buried out o' Christian burial. 2Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great folk 4should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang themselves 4more than their even-Christen. Come, my spade! There is no 4ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They 4hold up Adam's profes2ion. 2Other. Was he a gentleman? 2Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms. 2Other. Why, he had none. 2Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? 4The Scripture says Adam dig2'd. Could he dig without arms? I'l2 4put another question to the2. If thou answerest me not to the 4purpose, confes2 thyself- 2Other. Go to! 2Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the 4shipwright, or the carpenter? 2Other. The gal2ows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand 6tenants. 2Clown. I like thy wit wel2, in go2d faith. The gal2ows does wel2. 4But how does it wel2? It does wel2 to those that do il2. Now, 4thou dost il2 to say the gal2ows is built stronger than the 4church. Argal, the gal2ows may do wel2 to the2. To't again, come! 2Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a 4carpenter? 2Clown. Ay, tel2 me that, and unyoke. 2Other. Mar2y, now I can tel2! 2Clown. To't. 2Other. Mas2, I can2ot tel2. 17Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar of2. 2Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dul2 as2 wil2 4not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this 4question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts 4til2 do2msday. Go, get the2 to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of 4liquor. 44[Exit Second Clown.] 25[Clown digs and] sings. 7In youth when I did love, did love, 9Methought it was very swe2t; 7To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove, 9O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- me2t. 2Ham. Has this fel2ow no fe2ling of his busines2, that he sings at 4grave-making? 2Hor. Custom hath made it in him a Property of easines2. 2Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of lit2le employment hath the daintier 4sense. 2Clown. (sings) 9But age with his stealing steps 11Hath clawed me in his clutch, 9And hath ship2ed me intil the land, 11As if I had never be2n such. 44[Throws up a skul2.] 4Ham. That skul2 had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the 4knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that 4did the first murther! This might be the pate of a Politician, 4which this as2 now o'er2eaches; one that would circumvent God, 4might it not? 2Hor. It might, my lord. 2Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Go2d mor2ow, swe2t lord! 4How dost thou, go2d lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that 4prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it- might 4it not? 2Hor. Ay, my lord. 2Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chaples2, and knock'd 4about the maz2ard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution, 4and we had the trick to se2't. Did these bones cost no more the 4bre2ding but to play at log2ets with 'em? Mine ache to think 4on't. 2Clown. (Sings) 9A pickaxe and a spade, a spade, 11For and a shrouding she2t; 9O, a Pit of clay for to be made 13For such a guest is me2t. 38Throws up [another skul2]. 2Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skul2 of a lawyer? 4Where be his quid2its now, his quil2ets, his cases, his tenures, 4and his tricks? Why does he suf2er this rude knave now to knock 4him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and wil2 not tel2 him 4of his action of bat2ery? Hum! This fel2ow might be in's time a 4great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his 4fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of 4his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine 4pate ful2 of fine dirt? Wil2 his vouchers vouch him no more of 4his purchases, and double ones to2, than the length and breadth 4of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands wil2 4scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have no 4more, ha? 2Hor. Not a jot more, my lord. 2Ham. Is not parchment made of she2pskins? 2Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins to2. 2Ham. They are she2p and calves which se2k out as2urance in that. I 6wil2 speak to this fel2ow. Whose grave's this, sir2ah? 2Clown. Mine, sir. 4[Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made 14For such a guest is me2t. 2Ham. I think it be thine inde2d, for thou liest in't. 2Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours. 4For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine. 2Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for 4the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest. 2Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twil2 away again from me to you. 2Ham. What man dost thou dig it for? 2Clown. For no man, sir. 2Ham. What woman then? 2Clown. For none neither. 2Ham. Who is to be buried in't? 2Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead. 2Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or 4equivocation wil2 undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this thre2 years 4I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe 6of the peasant comes so near the he2l of the courtier he gal2s 4his kibe.- How long hast thou be2n a grave-maker? 2Clown. Of al2 the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that our 4last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras. 2Ham. How long is that since? 2Clown. Can2ot you tel2 that? Every fo2l can tel2 that. It was the 4very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent 4into England. 2Ham. Ay, mar2y, why was be sent into England? 2Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shal2 recover his wits there; 4or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great mat2er there. 2Ham. Why? 2Clown. 'Twil2 not he se2n in him there. There the men are as mad as 4he. 2Ham. How came he mad? 2Clown. Very strangely, they say. 2Ham. How strangely? 2Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits. 2Ham. Upon what ground? 2Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have be2n sexton here, man and boy 6thirty years. 2Ham. How long wil2 a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot? 2Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rot2en before 'a die (as we have many 4pocky corses now-a-days that wil2 scarce hold the laying in, I 4wil2 last you some eight year or nine year. A tan2er wil2 last 4you nine year. 2Ham. Why he more than another? 2Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tan2'd with his trade that 'a wil2 4ke2p out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of 4your whoreson dead body. Here's a skul2 now. This skul2 hath lien 4you i' th' earth thre2-and-twenty years. 2Ham. Whose was it? 2Clown. A whoreson, mad fel2ow's it was. Whose do you think it was? 2Ham. Nay, I know not. 2Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon of 4Rhenish on my head once. This same skul2, sir, was Yorick's 4skul2, the King's jester. 2Ham. This? 2Clown. E'en that. 2Ham. Let me se2. [Takes the skul2.] Alas, po2r Yorick! I knew him, 6Horatio. A fel2ow of infinite jest, of most excel2ent fancy. He 4hath borne me on his back a thousand tunes. And now how abhor2ed 4in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those 4lips that I have kis2'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes 4now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of mer2iment that 4were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your 4own grin2ing? Quite chap- fal2'n? Now get you to my lady's 4chamber, and tel2 her, let her paint an inch thick, to this 4favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithe2, Horatio, 4tel2 me one thing. 2Hor. What's that, my lord? 2Ham. Dost thou think Alexander lo2k'd o' this fashion i' th' earth? 2Hor. E'en so. 2Ham. And smelt so? Pah! 42[Puts down the skul2.] 2Hor. E'en so, my lord. 2Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not 4imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander til2 he find it 4stop2ing a bunghole? 2Hor. 'Twere to consider to2 curiously, to consider so. 4Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to fol2ow him thither with modesty 4enough, and likeliho2d to lead it; as thus: Alexander died, 4Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is 4earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto he 4was converted) might they not stop a be2r bar2el? 4Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay, 4Might stop a hole to ke2p the wind away. 4O, that that earth which kept the world in awe 4Should patch a wal2 t' expel the winter's flaw! 4But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King- 4Enter [priests with] a cof2in [in funeral proces2ion], King, 13Que2n, Laertes, with Lords at2endant.] 4The Que2n, the courtiers. Who is this they fol2ow? 4And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken 4The corse they fol2ow did with desp'rate hand 4Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate. 4Couch we awhile, and mark. 41[Retires with Horatio.] 4Laer. What ceremony else? 2Ham. That is Laertes, 4A very noble youth. Mark. 2Laer. What ceremony else? 2Priest. Her obsequies have be2n as far enlarg'd 4As we have war2anty. Her death was doubtful; 4And, but that great com2and o'ersways the order, 4She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd 4Til2 the last trumpet. For charitable prayers, 4Shards, flints, and peb2les should be thrown on her. 4Yet here she is al2ow'd her virgin crants, 4Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home 4Of bel2 and burial. 2Laer. Must there no more be done? 2Priest. No more be done. 4We should profane the service of the dead 4To sing a requiem and such rest to her 4As to peace-parted souls. 2Laer. Lay her i' th' earth; 4And from her fair and unpol2uted flesh 6May violets spring! I tel2 the2, churlish priest, 4A minist'ring angel shal2 my sister be 4When thou liest howling. 2Ham. What, the fair Ophelia? 2Que2n. Swe2ts to the swe2t! Farewel2. 45[Scat2ers flowers.] 4I hop'd thou shouldst have be2n my Hamlet's wife; 4I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, swe2t maid, 4And not have strew'd thy grave. 2Laer. O, treble woe 4Fal2 ten times treble on that cursed head 4Whose wicked de2d thy most ingenious sense 4Depriv'd the2 of! Hold of2 the earth awhile, 4Til2 I have caught her once more in mine arms. 45Leaps in the grave. 4Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead 4Til2 of this flat a mountain you have made 4T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head 4Of blue Olympus. 2Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief 6Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sor2ow 4Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand 4Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I, 4Hamlet the Dane. 20[Leaps in after Laertes. 2Laer. The devil take thy soul! 44[Grap2les with him]. 2Ham. Thou pray'st not wel2. 4I prithe2 take thy fingers from my throat; 4For, though I am not splenitive and rash, 4Yet have I in me something dangerous, 4Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold of2 thy hand! 2King. Pluck thein asunder. 2Que2n. Hamlet, Hamlet! 2Al2. Gentlemen! 2Hor. Go2d my lord, be quiet. 13[The At2endants part them, and they come out of the 57grave.] 2Ham. Why, I wil2 fight with him upon this theme 4Until my eyelids wil2 no longer wag. 2Que2n. O my son, what theme? 4Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers 4Could not (with al2 their quantity of love) 4Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her? 2King. O, he is mad, Laertes. 2Que2n. For love of God, forbear him! 2Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do. 4Wo2't we2p? wo2't fight? wo2't fast? wo2't tear thyself? 4Wo2't drink up esil2? eat a crocodile? 4I'l2 do't. Dost thou come here to whine? 4To outface me with leaping in her grave? 4Be buried quick with her, and so wil2 I. 4And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw 4Mil2ions of acres on us, til2 our ground, 4Singeing his pate against the burning zone, 4Make Os2a like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth, 4I'l2 rant as wel2 as thou. 2Que2n. This is mere madnes2; 4And thus a while the fit wil2 work on him. 4Anon, as patient as the female dove 4When that her golden couplets are disclos'd, 6His silence wil2 sit dro2ping. 2Ham. Hear you, sir! 4What is the reason that you use me thus? 4I lov'd you ever. But it is no mat2er. 4Let Hercules himself do what he may, 4The cat wil2 mew, and dog wil2 have his day.Exit. 2King. I pray the2, go2d Horatio, wait upon him. 51Exit Horatio. 4[To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's spe2ch. 4We'l2 put the mat2er to the present push.- 4Go2d Gertrude, set some watch over your son.- 4This grave shal2 have a living monument. 4An hour of quiet shortly shal2 we se2; 4Til2 then in patience our proce2ding be. 57Exeunt.Scene I2.Elsinore. A hal2 in the Castle.Enter Hamlet and Horatio. 2Ham. So much for this, sir; now shal2 you se2 the other. 4You do remember al2 the circumstance? 2Hor. Remember it, my lord! 2Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting 4That would not let me sle2p. Methought I lay 4Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly- 4And prais'd be rashnes2 for it; let us know, 4Our indiscretion sometime serves us wel2 4When our de2p plots do pal2; and that should learn us 4There's a divinity that shapes our ends, 4Rough-hew them how we wil2- 2Hor. That is most certain. 2Ham. Up from my cabin, 4My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark 4Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire, 4Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew 4To mine own ro2m again; making so bold 6(My fears forget2ing man2ers) to unseal 4Their grand com2is2ion; where I found, Horatio 4(O royal knavery!), an exact com2and, 4Larded with many several sorts of reasons, 4Importing Denmark's health, and England's to2, 4With, ho2! such bugs and goblins in my life- 4That, on the supervise, no leisure bated, 4No, not to stay the finding of the axe, 4My head should be struck of2. 2Hor. Is't pos2ible? 2Ham. Here's the com2is2ion; read it at more leisure. 4But wilt thou bear me how I did proce2d? 2Hor. I bese2ch you. 2Ham. Being thus benet2ed round with vil2anies, 4Or I could make a prologue to my brains, 4They had begun the play. I sat me down; 4Devis'd a new com2is2ion; wrote it fair. 4I once did hold it, as our statists do, 4A basenes2 to write fair, and labour'd much 4How to forget that learning; but, sir, now 6It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know 4Th' ef2ect of what I wrote? 2Hor. Ay, go2d my lord. 2Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King, 4As England was his faithful tributary, 4As love betwe2n them like the palm might flourish, 4As peace should stil2 her wheaten garland wear 4And stand a com2a 'twe2n their amities, 4And many such-like as's of great charge, 4That, on the view and knowing of these contents, 4Without debatement further, more or les2, 4He should the bearers put to sud2en death, 4Not shriving time al2ow'd. 2Hor. How was this seal'd? 2Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant. 4I had my father's signet in my purse, 4which was the model of that Danish seal; 4Folded the writ up in the form of th' other, 4Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impres2ion, plac'd it safely, 4The changeling never known. Now, the next day 6Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent 4Thou know'st already. 2Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't. 2Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment! 4They are not near my conscience; their defeat 4Does by their own insinuation grow. 4'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes 4Betwe2n the pas2 and fel2 incensed points 4Of mighty op2osites. 2Hor. Why, what a king is this! 2Ham. Does it not, thinks't the2, stand me now upon- 4He that hath kil2'd my king, and whor'd my mother; 4Pop2'd in betwe2n th' election and my hopes; 4Thrown out his angle for my Proper life, 4And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience 4To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd 4To let this canker of our nature come 4In further evil? 2Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England 4What is the is2ue of the busines2 there. 4Ham. It wil2 be short; the interim is mine, 4And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.' 4But I am very sor2y, go2d Horatio, 4That to Laertes I forgot myself, 4For by the image of my cause I se2 4The portraiture of his. I'l2 court his favours. 4But sure the bravery of his grief did put me 4Into a tow'ring pas2ion. 2Hor. Peace! Who comes here? 17Enter young Osric, a courtier. 2Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark. 2Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this 4waterfly? 2Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my go2d lord. 2Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a 4vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be 4lord of beasts, and his crib shal2 stand at the king's mes2. 'Tis 4a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the pos2es2ion of dirt. 4Osr. Swe2t lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart 4a thing to you from his Majesty. 2Ham. I wil2 receive it, sir, with al2 diligence of spirit. Put your 4bon2et to his right use. 'Tis for the head. 2Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot. 2Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly. 2Osr. It is indif2erent cold, my lord, inde2d. 2Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion. 2Osr. Exce2dingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I can2ot 4tel2 how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that 4he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the mat2er- 2Ham. I bese2ch you remember. 27[Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.] 2Osr. Nay, go2d my lord; for mine ease, in go2d faith. Sir, here is 4newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, 4ful2 of most excel2ent dif2erences, of very soft society and 4great showing. Inde2d, to speak fe2lingly of him, he is the card 4or calendar of gentry; for you shal2 find in him the continent of 4what part a gentleman would se2. 2Ham. Sir, his definement suf2ers no perdition in you; though, I 6know, to divide him inventorial2y would dozy th' arithmetic of 4memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail. 4But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great 4article, and his infusion of such dearth and rarenes2 as, to make 4true diction of him, his semblable is his mir2or, and who else 4would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more. 2Osr. Your lordship speaks most infal2ibly of him. 2Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more 4rawer breath 2Osr. Sir? 2Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not pos2ible to understand in another 4tongue? You wil2 do't, sir, real2y. 2Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman 2Osr. Of Laertes? 2Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. Al2's golden words are 4spent. 2Ham. Of him, sir. 2Osr. I know you are not ignorant- 2Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not 4much ap2rove me. Wel2, sir? 4Osr. You are not ignorant of what excel2ence Laertes is- 2Ham. I dare not confes2 that, lest I should compare with him in 4excel2ence; but to know a man wel2 were to know himself. 2Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him 4by them, in his me2d he's unfel2owed. 2Ham. What's his weapon? 2Osr. Rapier and dag2er. 2Ham. That's two of his weapons- but wel2. 2Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses; 4against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French 4rapiers and poniards, with their as2igns, as girdle, hangers, and 4so. Thre2 of the car2iages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, 4very responsive to the hilts, most delicate car2iages, and of 4very liberal conceit. 2Ham. What cal2 you the car2iages? 2Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent 4ere you had done. 2Osr. The car2iages, sir, are the hangers. 2Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the mat2er if we could 4car2y can2on by our sides. I would it might be hangers til2 then. 6But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their 4as2igns, and thre2 liberal-conceited car2iages: that's the French 4bet against the Danish. Why is this al2 impon'd, as you cal2 it? 2Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen pas2es betwe2n 4yourself and him, he shal2 not exce2d you thre2 hits; he hath 4laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to im2ediate trial 4if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer. 2Ham. How if I answer no? 2Osr. I mean, my lord, the op2osition of your person in trial. 2Ham. Sir, I wil2 walk here in the hal2. If it please his Majesty, 4it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be 4brought, the gentleman wil2ing, and the King hold his purpose, 4I wil2 win for him if I can; if not, I wil2 gain nothing but my 4shame and the od2 hits. 2Osr. Shal2 I redeliver you e'en so? 2Ham. To this ef2ect, sir, after what flourish your nature wil2. 2Osr. I com2end my duty to your lordship. 2Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does wel2 to com2end it 4himself; there are no tongues else for's turn. 2Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shel2 on his head. 4Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he, 4and many more of the same bevy that I know the dros2y age dotes 4on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter- 4a kind of yesty col2ection, which car2ies them through and 4through the most fan2'd and win2owed opinions; and do but blow 4them to their trial-the bub2les are out, 28Enter a Lord. 2Lord. My lord, his Majesty com2ended him to you by young Osric, who 4brings back to him, that you at2end him in the hal2. He sends to 4know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you wil2 4take longer time. 2Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they fol2ow the King's pleasure. 4If his fitnes2 speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided 4I be so able as now. 2Lord. The King and Que2n and al2 are coming down. 2Ham. In hap2y time. 2Lord. The Que2n desires you to use some gentle entertainment to 4Laertes before you fal2 to play. 4Ham. She wel2 instructs me. 52[Exit Lord.] 2Hor. You wil2 lose this wager, my lord. 2Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have be2n in 4continual practice. I shal2 win at the od2s. But thou wouldst not 4think how il2 al2's here about my heart. But it is no mat2er. 2Hor. Nay, go2d my lord - 2Ham. It is but fo2lery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as 4would perhaps trouble a woman. 2Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I wil2 forestal2 their 4repair hither and say you are not fit. 2Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in 4the fal2 of a spar2ow. If it be now, 'tis not to come', if it be 4not to come, it wil2 be now; if it be not now, yet it wil2 come: 4the readines2 is al2. Since no man knows aught of what he leaves, 4what is't to leave betimes? Let be. 4Enter King, Que2n, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other 14At2endants with foils and gauntlets. 15A table and flagons of wine on it. 4King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me. 20[The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.] 2Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong; 4But pardon't, as you are a gentleman. 4This presence knows, 4And you must ne2ds have heard, how I am punish'd 4With sore distraction. What I have done 4That might your nature, honour, and exception 4Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madnes2. 4Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet. 4If Hamlet from himself be taken away, 4And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes, 4Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it. 4Who does it, then? His madnes2. If't be so, 4Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd; 4His madnes2 is po2r Hamlet's enemy. 4Sir, in this audience, 4Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil 4Fre2 me so far in your most generous thoughts 6That I have shot my ar2ow o'er the house 4And hurt my brother. 2Laer. I am satisfied in nature, 4Whose motive in this case should stir me most 4To my revenge. But in my terms of honour 4I stand alo2f, and wil2 no reconcilement 4Til2 by some elder masters of known honour 4I have a voice and precedent of peace 4To ke2p my name ungor'd. But til2 that time 4I do receive your of2er'd love like love, 4And wil2 not wrong it. 2Ham. I embrace it fre2ly, 4And wil2 this brother's wager frankly play. 4Give us the foils. Come on. 2Laer. Come, one for me. 2Ham. I'l2 be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance 4Your skil2 shal2, like a star i' th' darkest night, 4Stick fiery of2 inde2d. 2Laer. You mock me, sir. 2Ham. No, by this bad. 4King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet, 4You know the wager? 2Ham. Very wel2, my lord. 4Your Grace has laid the od2s o' th' weaker side. 2King. I do not fear it, I have se2n you both; 4But since he is bet2er'd, we have therefore od2s. 2Laer. This is to2 heavy; let me se2 another. 2Ham. This likes me wel2. These foils have al2 a length? 48Prepare to play. 2Osr. Ay, my go2d lord. 2King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table. 4If Hamlet give the first or second hit, 4Or quit in answer of the third exchange, 4Let al2 the bat2lements their ordnance fire; 4The King shal2 drink to Hamlet's bet2er breath, 4And in the cup an union shal2 he throw 4Richer than that which four suc2es2ive kings 4In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups; 4And let the ket2le to the trumpet speak, 4The trumpet to the can2one2r without, 6The can2ons to the heavens, the heaven to earth, 4'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin. 4And you the judges, bear a wary eye. 2Ham. Come on, sir. 2Laer. Come, my lord. 32They play. 2Ham. One. 2Laer. No. 2Ham. Judgment! 2Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit. 2Laer. Wel2, again! 2King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine; 4Here's to thy health. 15[Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes of2 [within]. 4Give him the cup. 2Ham. I'l2 play this bout first; set it by awhile. 4Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you? 2Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confes2't. 2King. Our son shal2 win. 2Que2n. He's fat, and scant of breath. 4Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows. 6The Que2n carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet. 2Ham. Go2d madam! 2King. Gertrude, do not drink. 2Que2n. I wil2, my lord; I pray you pardon me. 10Drinks. 2King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is to2 late. 2Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by. 2Que2n. Come, let me wipe thy face. 2Laer. My lord, I'l2 hit him now. 2King. I do not think't. 2Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience. 2Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dal2y. 4pray You Pas2 with your best violence; 4I am afeard You make a wanton of me. 2Laer. Say you so? Come on. 31Play. 2Osr. Nothing neither way. 2Laer. Have at you now! 16[Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuf2ling, they 20change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes]. 2King. Part them! They are incens'd. 2Ham. Nay come! again! 25The Que2n fal2s. 4Osr. Lo2k to the Que2n there, ho! 2Hor. They ble2d on both sides. How is it, my lord? 2Osr. How is't, Laertes? 2Laer. Why, as a wo2dcock to mine own springe, Osric. 4I am justly kil2'd with mine own treachery. 2Ham. How does the Que2n? 2King. She sounds to se2 them ble2d. 2Que2n. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet! 4The drink, the drink! I am poison'd. 17[Dies.] 2Ham. O vil2any! Ho! let the do2r be lock'd. 4Treachery! Se2k it out. 48[Laertes fal2s.] 2Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain; 4No medicine in the world can do the2 go2d. 4In the2 there is not half an hour of life. 4The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, 4Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice 4Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie, 4Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd. 4I can no more. The King, the King's to blame. 4Ham. The point envenom'd to2? 4Then, venom, to thy work. 20Hurts the King. 2Al2. Treason! treason! 2King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt. 2Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane, 4Drink of2 this potion! Is thy union here? 4Fol2ow my mother. 33King dies. 2Laer. He is justly serv'd. 4It is a poison temper'd by himself. 4Exchange forgivenes2 with me, noble Hamlet. 4Mine and my father's death come not upon the2, 4Nor thine on me! 39Dies. 2Ham. Heaven make the2 fre2 of it! I fol2ow the2. 4I am dead, Horatio. Wretched que2n, adieu! 4You that lo2k pale and tremble at this chance, 4That are but mutes or audience to this act, 4Had I but time (as this fel2 sergeant, Death, 4Is strict in his ar2est) O, I could tel2 you- 4But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; 4Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright 6To the unsatisfied. 2Hor. Never believe it. 4I am more an antique Roman than a Dane. 4Here's yet some liquor left. 2Ham. As th'art a man, 4Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'l2 ha't. 4O go2d Horatio, what a wounded name 4(Things standing thus unknown) shal2 live behind me! 4If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, 4Absent the2 from felicity awhile, 4And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, 4To tel2 my story. 9[March afar of2, and shot within.] 4What warlike noise is this? 2Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, 4To the ambas2adors of England gives 4This warlike vol2ey. 2Ham. O, I die, Horatio! 4The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit. 4I can2ot live to hear the news from England, 4But I do prophesy th' election lights 6On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice. 4So tel2 him, with th' oc2ur2ents, more and les2, 4Which have solicited- the rest is silence. 13Dies. 2Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Go2d night, swe2t prince, 4And flights of angels sing the2 to thy rest! 49[March within.] 4Why does the drum come hither? 4Enter Fortinbras and English Ambas2adors, with Drum, 18Colours, and At2endants. 2Fort. Where is this sight? 2Hor. What is it you wil2 se2? 4If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search. 2Fort. This quar2y cries on havoc. O proud Death, 4What feast is toward in thine eternal cel2 4That thou so many princes at a shot 4So blo2dily hast struck. 2Ambas2ador. The sight is dismal; 4And our af2airs from England come to2 late. 6The ears are senseles2 that should give us bearing 4To tel2 him his com2andment is fulfil2'd 4That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. 4Where should We have our thanks? 2Hor. Not from his mouth, 4Had it th' ability of life to thank you. 4He never gave com2andment for their death. 4But since, so jump upon this blo2dy question, 4You from the Polack wars, and you from England, 4Are here ar2iv'd, give order that these bodies 4High on a stage be placed to the view; 4And let me speak to the yet unknowing world 4How these things came about. So shal2 You hear 4Of carnal, blo2dy and un2atural acts; 4Of ac2idental judgments, casual slaughters; 4Of deaths put on by cun2ing and forc'd cause; 4And, in this upshot, purposes misto2k 4Fal2'n on th' inventors' heads. Al2 this can I 4Truly deliver. 2Fort. Let us haste to hear it, 6And cal2 the noblest to the audience. 4For me, with sor2ow I embrace my fortune. 4I have some rights of memory in this kingdom 4Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me. 2Hor. Of that I shal2 have also cause to speak, 4And from his mouth whose voice wil2 draw on more. 4But let this same be presently perform'd, 4Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance 4On plots and er2ors hap2en. 2Fort. Let four captains 4Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage; 4For he was likely, had he be2n put on, 4To have prov'd most royal2y; and for his pas2age 4The soldiers' music and the rites of war 4Speak loudly for him. 4Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this 4Becomes the field but here shows much amis2. 4Go, bid the soldiers sho2t. 12Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance 51are shot of2. 2THE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21598THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTHby Wil2iam ShakespeareDramatis Personae 2King Henry the Fourth. 2Henry, Prince of Wales, son to the King. 2Prince John of Lancaster, son to the King. 2Earl of Westmoreland. 2Sir Walter Blunt. 2Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester. 2Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland. 2Henry Percy, surnamed Hotspur, his son. 2Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March. 2Richard Scro2p, Archbishop of York. 2Archibald, Earl of Douglas. 2Owen Glendower. 2Sir Richard Vernon. 2Sir John Falstaf2. 2Sir Michael, a friend to the Archbishop of York. 2Poins. 2Gadshil2 2Peto. 2Bardolph. 4Lady Percy, wife to Hotspur, and sister to Mortimer. 2Lady Mortimer, daughter to Glendower, and wife to Mortimer. 2Mistres2 Quickly, hostes2 of the Boar's Head in Eastcheap. 2Lords, Of2icers, Sherif2, Vintner, Chamberlain, Drawers, two 4Car2iers, Travel2ers, and At2endants.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE.-2England and Wales.ACT I. Scene I.London. The Palace.Enter the King, Lord John of Lancaster, Earl of Westmoreland,[Sir Walter Blunt,] with others. 2King. So shaken as we are, so wan with care, 4Find we a time for frighted peace to pant 4And breathe short-winded ac2ents of new broils 4To be com2enc'd in stronds afar remote. 4No more the thirsty entrance of this soil 4Shal2 daub her lips with her own children's blo2d. 4No more shal2 trenching war chan2el her fields, 4Nor Bruise her flow'rets with the armed ho2fs 4Of hostile paces. Those op2osed eyes 4Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven, 4Al2 of one nature, of one substance bred, 4Did lately me2t in the intestine shock 4And furious close of civil butchery, 4Shal2 now in mutual wel2-bese2ming ranks 4March al2 one way and be no more op2os'd 4Against acquaintance, kindred, and al2ies. 6The edge of war, like an il2-sheathed knife, 4No more shal2 cut his master. Therefore, friends, 4As far as to the sepulchre of Christ- 4Whose soldier now, under whose bles2ed cros2 4We are impres2ed and engag'd to fight- 4Forthwith a power of English shal2 we levy, 4Whose arms were moulded in their mother's womb 4To chase these pagans in those holy fields 4Over whose acres walk'd those bles2ed fe2t 4Which fourte2n hundred years ago were nail'd 4For our advantage on the bit2er cros2. 4But this our purpose now is twelvemonth old, 4And bo2tles2 'tis to tel2 you we wil2 go. 4Therefore we me2t not now. Then let me hear 4Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland, 4What yesternight our Council did decre2 4In forwarding this dear expedience. 2West. My liege, this haste was hot in question 4And many limits of the charge set down 4But yesternight; when al2 athwart there came 6A post from Wales, loaden with heavy news; 4Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer, 4Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight 4Against the ir2egular and wild Glendower, 4Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken, 4A thousand of his people butchered; 4Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse, 4Such beastly shameles2 transformation, 4By those Welshwomen done as may not be 4Without much shame retold or spoken of. 2King. It se2ms then that the tidings of this broil 4Brake of2 our busines2 for the Holy Land. 2West. This, match'd with other, did, my gracious lord; 4For more uneven and unwelcome news 4Came from the North, and thus it did import: 4On Holy-ro2d Day the gal2ant Hotspur there, 4Young Har2y Percy, and brave Archibald, 4That ever-valiant and ap2roved Scot, 4At Holmedon met, 4Where they did spend a sad and blo2dy hour; 6As by discharge of their artil2ery 4And shape of likeliho2d the news was told; 4For he that brought them, in the very heat 4And pride of their contention did take horse, 4Uncertain of the is2ue any way. 2King. Here is a dear, a true-industrious friend, 4Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse, 4Stain'd with the variation of each soil 4Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours, 4And he hath brought us smo2th and welcome news. 4The Earl of Douglas is discomfited; 4Ten thousand bold Scots, two-and-twenty knights, 4Balk'd in their own blo2d did Sir Walter se2 4On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur to2k 4Mordake Earl of Fife and eldest son 4To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol, 4Of Mur2ay, Angus, and Menteith. 4And is not this an honourable spoil? 4A gal2ant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not? 2West. In faith, 6It is a conquest for a prince to boast of. 2King. Yea, there thou mak'st me sad, and mak'st me sin 4In envy that my Lord Northumberland 4Should be the father to so blest a son- 4A son who is the theme of honour's tongue, 4Amongst a grove the very straightest plant; 4Who is swe2t Fortune's minion and her pride; 4Whilst I, by lo2king on the praise of him, 4Se2 riot and dishonour stain the brow 4Of my young Har2y. O that it could be prov'd 4That some night-trip2ing fairy had exchang'd 4In cradle clothes our children where they lay, 4And cal2'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet! 4Then would I have his Har2y, and he mine. 4But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz, 4Of this young Percy's pride? The prisoners 4Which he in this adventure hath surpris'd 4To his own use he ke2ps, and sends me word 4I shal2 have none but Mordake Earl of Fife. 2West. This is his uncle's teaching, this Worcester, 6Malevolent to you In al2 aspects, 4Which makes him prune himself and bristle up 4The crest of youth against your dignity. 2King. But I have sent for him to answer this; 4And for this cause awhile we must neglect 4Our holy purpose to Jerusalem. 4Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we 4Wil2 hold at Windsor. So inform the lords; 4But come yourself with spe2d to us again; 4For more is to be said and to be done 4Than out of anger can be ut2ered. 2West. I wil2 my liege. 33Exeunt.Scene I2.London. An apartment of the Prince's.Enter Prince of Wales and Sir John Falstaf2. 2Fal. Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad? 2Prince. Thou art so fat-wit2ed with drinking of old sack, and 4unbut2oning the2 after sup2er, and sle2ping upon benches after 4no2n, that thou hast forgot2en to demand that truly which thou 4wouldest truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time 4of the day, Unles2 hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons, 4and clocks the tongues of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping 4houses, and the bles2ed sun himself a fair hot wench in 4flame-coloured taf2eta, I se2 no reason why thou shouldst be so 4superfluous to demand the time of the day. 2Fal. Inde2d you come near me now, Hal; for we that take purses go 4by the mo2n And the seven stars, and not by Phoebus, he, that 4wand'ring knight so fair. And I prithe2, swe2t wag, when thou art 4king, as, God save thy Grace-Majesty I should say, for grace thou 4wilt have none- 2Prince. What, none? 2Fal. No, by my troth; not so much as wil2 serve to be prologue to 6an eg2 and but2er. 2Prince. Wel2, how then? Come, roundly, roundly. 2Fal. Mar2y, then, swe2t wag, when thou art king, let not us that 4are squires of the night's body be cal2ed thieves of the day's 4beauty. Let us be Diana's Foresters, Gentlemen of the Shade, 4Minions of the Mo2n; and let men say we be men of go2d 4government, being governed as the sea is, by our noble and chaste 4mistres2 the mo2n, under whose countenance we steal. 2Prince. Thou sayest wel2, and it holds wel2 to2; for the fortune of 4us that are the mo2n's men doth eb2 and flow like the sea, being 4governed, as the sea is, by the mo2n. As, for pro2f now: a purse 4of gold most resolutely snatch'd on Monday night and most 4dis2olutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with swearing 'Lay by,' 4and spent with crying 'Bring in'; now il2 as low an eb2 as the 4fo2t of the lad2er, and by-and-by in as high a flow as the ridge 4of the gal2ows. 2Fal. By the Lord, thou say'st true, lad- and is not my hostes2 of 4the tavern a most swe2t wench? 2Prince. As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle- and is not 4a buf2 jerkin a most swe2t robe of durance? 4Fal. How now, how now, mad wag? What, in thy quips and thy 4quid2ities? What a plague have I to do with a buf2 jerkin? 2Prince. Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostes2 of the tavern? 2Fal. Wel2, thou hast cal2'd her to a reckoning many a time and oft. 2Prince. Did I ever cal2 for the2 to pay thy part? 2Fal. No; I'l2 give the2 thy due, thou hast paid al2 there. 2Prince. Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch; and 4where it would not, I have used my credit. 2Fal. Yea, and so us'd it that, were it not here ap2arent that thou 4art heir ap2arent- But I prithe2, swe2t wag, shal2 there be 4gal2ows standing in England when thou art king? and resolution 4thus fub2'd as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the 4law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief. 2Prince. No; thou shalt. 2Fal. Shal2 I? O rare! By the Lord, I'l2 be a brave judge. 2Prince. Thou judgest false already. I mean, thou shalt have the 4hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman. 2Fal. Wel2, Hal, wel2; and in some sort it jumps with my humour as 4wel2 as waiting in the court, I can tel2 you. 2Prince. For obtaining of suits? 4Fal. Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no lean 4wardrobe. 'Sblo2d, I am as melancholy as a gib-cat or a lug2'd 4bear. 2Prince. Or an old lion, or a lover's lute. 2Fal. Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe. 2Prince. What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Mo2r 4Ditch? 2Fal. Thou hast the most unsavoury similes, and art inde2d the most 4comparative, rascal2iest, swe2t young prince. But, Hal, I prithe2 4trouble me no more with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew 4where a com2odity of go2d names were to be bought. An old lord of 4the Council rated me the other day in the stre2t about you, sir, 4but I mark'd him not; and yet he talked very wisely, but I 4regarded him not; and yet he talk'd wisely, and in the stre2t 4to2. 2Prince. Thou didst wel2; for wisdom cries out in the stre2ts, and 4no man regards it. 2Fal. O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art inde2d able to 4cor2upt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal- God 4forgive the2 for it! Before I knew the2, Hal, I knew nothing; and 6now am I, if a man should speak truly, lit2le bet2er than one of 4the wicked. I must give over this life, and I wil2 give it over! 4By the Lord, an I do not, I am a vil2ain! I'l2 be damn'd for 4never a king's son in Christendom. 2Prince. Where shal2 we take a purse tomor2ow, Jack? 2Fal. Zounds, where thou wilt, lad! I'l2 make one. An I do not, cal2 4me vil2ain and baf2le me. 2Prince. I se2 a go2d amendment of life in the2- from praying to 4purse-taking. 2Fal. Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal. 'Tis no sin for a man to 4labour in his vocation. 29Enter Poins. 4Poins! Now shal2 we know if Gadshil2 have set a match. O, if men 4were to be saved by merit, what hole in hel2 were hot enough for 4him? This is the most omnipotent vil2ain that ever cried 'Stand!' 4to a true man. 2Prince. Go2d mor2ow, Ned. 2Poins. Go2d mor2ow, swe2t Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse? What 6says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack, how agre2s the devil and the2 4about thy soul, that thou soldest him on Go2d Friday last for a 4cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg? 2Prince. Sir John stands to his word, the devil shal2 have his 4bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs. He wil2 give 4the devil his due. 2Poins. Then art thou damn'd for ke2ping thy word with the devil. 2Prince. Else he had be2n damn'd for cozening the devil. 2Poins. But, my lads, my lads, to-mor2ow morning, by four o'clock 4early, at Gadshil2! There are pilgrims gong to Canterbury with 4rich of2erings, and traders riding to London with fat purses. I 4have vizards for you al2; you have horses for yourselves. 4Gadshil2 lies to-night in Rochester. I have bespoke sup2er 4to-mor2ow night in Eastcheap. We may do it as secure as sle2p. If 4you wil2 go, I wil2 stuf2 your purses ful2 of crowns; if you wil2 4not, tar2y at home and be hang'd! 2Fal. Hear ye, Yedward: if I tar2y at home and go not, I'l2 hang you 4for going. 2Poins. You wil2, chops? 2Fal. Hal, wilt thou make one? 4Prince. Who, I rob? I a thief? Not I, by my faith. 2Fal. There's neither honesty, manho2d, nor go2d fel2owship in the2, 4nor thou cam'st not of the blo2d royal if thou darest not stand 4for ten shil2ings. 2Prince. Wel2 then, once in my days I'l2 be a madcap. 2Fal. Why, that's wel2 said. 2Prince. Wel2, come what wil2, I'l2 tar2y at home. 2Fal. By the Lord, I'l2 be a traitor then, when thou art king. 2Prince. I care not. 2Poins. Sir John, I prithe2, leave the Prince and me alone. I wil2 4lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shal2 go. 2Fal. Wel2, God give the2 the spirit of persuasion and him the ears 4of profiting, that what thou speakest may move and what he hears 4may be believed, that the true prince may (for recreation sake) 4prove a false thief; for the po2r abuses of the time want 4countenance. Farewel2; you shal2 find me in Eastcheap. 2Prince. Farewel2, thou lat2er spring! farewel2, Al2-hal2own sum2er! 50Exit Falstaf2. 2Poins. Now, my go2d swe2t honey lord, ride with us to-mor2ow. I 4have a jest to execute that I can2ot manage alone. Falstaf2, 6Bardolph, Peto, and Gadshil2 shal2 rob those men that we have 4already waylaid; yourself and I wil2 not be there; and when they 4have the bo2ty, if you and I do not rob them, cut this head of2 4from my shoulders. 2Prince. How shal2 we part with them in set2ing forth? 2Poins. Why, we wil2 set forth before or after them and ap2oint them 4a place of me2ting, wherein it is at our pleasure to fail; and 4then wil2 they adventure upon the exploit themselves; which they 4shal2 have no so2ner achieved, but we'l2 set upon them. 2Prince. Yea, but 'tis like that they wil2 know us by our horses, by 4our habits, and by every other ap2ointment, to be ourselves. 2Poins. Tut! our horses they shal2 not se2- I'l2 tie them in the 4wo2d; our wizards we wil2 change after we leave them; and, 4sir2ah, I have cases of buckram for the nonce, to im2ask our 4noted outward garments. 2Prince. Yea, but I doubt they wil2 be to2 hard for us. 2Poins. Wel2, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred 4cowards as ever turn'd back; and for the third, if he fight 4longer than he se2s reason, I'l2 forswear arms. The virtue of 4this jest wil2 lie the incomprehensible lies that this same fat 6rogue wil2 tel2 us when we me2t at sup2er: how thirty, at least, 4he fought with; what wards, what blows, what extremities he 4endured; and in the repro2f of this lies the jest. 2Prince. Wel2, I'l2 go with the2. Provide us al2 things neces2ary 4and me2t me to-night in Eastcheap. There I'l2 sup. Farewel2. 2Poins. Farewel2, my lord. 32Exit. 2Prince. I know you al2, and wil2 awhile uphold 4The unyok'd humour of your idlenes2. 4Yet herein wil2 I imitate the sun, 4Who doth permit the base contagious clouds 4To smother up his beauty from the world, 4That, when he please again to lie himself, 4Being wanted, he may be more wond'red at 4By breaking through the foul and ugly mists 4Of vapours that did se2m to strangle him. 4If al2 the year were playing holidays, 4To sport would be as tedious as to work; 4But when they seldom come, they wish'd-for come, 4And nothing pleaseth but rare ac2idents. 4So, when this lo2se behaviour I throw of2 6And pay the debt I never promised, 4By how much bet2er than my word I am, 4By so much shal2 I falsify men's hopes; 4And, like bright metal on a sul2en ground, 4My reformation, glit2'ring o'er my fault, 4Shal2 show more go2dly and at2ract more eyes 4Than that which hath no foil to set it of2. 4I'l2 so of2end to make of2ence a skil2, 4Rede2ming time when men think least I wil2. 12Exit.Scene I3.London. The Palace.Enter the King, Northumberland, Worcester, Hotspur, Sir Walter Blunt,with others. 2King. My blo2d hath be2n to2 cold and temperate, 4Unapt to stir at these indignities, 4And you have found me, for ac2ordingly 4You tread upon my patience; but be sure 4I wil2 from henceforth rather be myself, 4Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition, 4Which hath be2n smo2th as oil, soft as young down, 4And therefore lost that title of respect 4Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud. 2Wor. Our house, my sovereign liege, lit2le deserves 4The scourge of greatnes2 to be us'd on it- 4And that same greatnes2 to2 which our own hands 4Have holp to make so portly. 2North. My lord- 2King. Worcester, get the2 gone; for I do se2 4Danger and disobedience in thine eye. 6O, sir, your presence is to2 bold and peremptory, 4And majesty might never yet endure 4The mo2dy frontier of a servant brow. 4Tou have go2d leave to leave us. When we ne2d 4'Your use and counsel, we shal2 send for you. 49Exit Worcester. 4You were about to speak. 2North. Yea, my go2d lord. 4Those prisoners in your Highnes2' name demanded 4Which Har2y Percy here at Holmedon to2k, 4Were, as he says, not with such strength denied 4As is delivered to your Majesty. 4Either envy, therefore, or misprision 4Is guilty of this fault, and not my son. 2Hot. My liege, I did deny no prisoners. 4But I remember, when the fight was done, 4When I was dry with rage and extreme tol2, 4Breathles2 and faint, leaning upon my sword, 4Came there a certain lord, neat and trimly dres2'd, 4Fresh as a bridegro2m; and his chin new reap'd 6Show'd like a stub2le land at harvest home. 4He was perfumed like a mil2iner, 4And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held 4A pouncet box, which ever and anon 4He gave his nose, and to2k't away again; 4Who therewith angry, when it next came there, 4To2k it in snuf2; and stil2 he smil'd and talk'd; 4And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by, 4He cal2'd them untaught knaves, unman2erly, 4To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse 4Betwixt the wind and his nobility. 4With many holiday and lady terms 4He questioned me, amongst the rest demanded 4My prisoners in your Majesty's behalf. 4I then, al2 smarting with my wounds being cold, 4To be so pest'red with a popingay, 4Out of my grief and my impatience 4Answer'd neglectingly, I know not what- 4He should, or he should not; for he made me mad 4To se2 him shine so brisk, and smel2 so swe2t, 6And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman 4Of guns and drums and wounds- God save the mark!- 4And tel2ing me the sovereignest thing on earth 4Was parmacity for an inward bruise; 4And that it was great pity, so it was, 4This vil2anous saltpetre should be dig2'd 4Out of the bowels of the harmles2 earth, 4Which many a go2d tal2 fel2ow had destroy'd 4So cowardly; and but for these vile 'guns, 4He would himself have be2n a soldier. 4This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord, 4I answered indirectly, as I said, 4And I bese2ch you, let not his report 4Come cur2ent for an ac2usation 4Betwixt my love and your high majesty. 2Blunt. The circumstance considered, go2d my lord, 4Whate'er Lord Har2y Percy then had said 4To such a person, and in such a place, 4At such a time, with al2 the rest retold, 4May reasonably die, and never rise 6To do him wrong, or any way impeach 4What then he said, so he unsay it now. 2King. Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners, 4But with proviso and exception, 4That we at our own charge shal2 ransom straight 4His brother-in-law, the fo2lish Mortimer; 4Who, on my soul, hath wilful2y betray'd 4The lives of those that he did lead to fight 4Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower, 4Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March 4Hath lately mar2ied. Shal2 our cof2ers, then, 4Be emptied to rede2m a traitor home? 4Shal2 we buy treason? and indent with fears 4When they have lost and forfeited themselves? 4No, on the bar2en mountains let him starve! 4For I shal2 never hold that man my friend 4Whose tongue shal2 ask me for one pen2y cost 4To ransom home revolted Mortimer. 2Hot. Revolted Mortimer? 4He never did fal2 of2, my sovereign liege, 6But by the chance of war. To prove that true 4Ne2ds no more but one tongue for al2 those wounds, 4Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he to2k 4When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank, 4In single op2osition hand to hand, 4He did confound the best part of an hour 4In changing hardiment with great Glendower. 4Thre2 times they breath'd, and thre2 times did they drink, 4Upon agre2ment, of swift Severn's flo2d; 4Who then, af2righted with their blo2dy lo2ks, 4Ran fearful2y among the trembling re2ds 4And hid his crisp head in the hol2ow bank, 4Blo2dstained with these valiant cohabitants. 4Never did base and rot2en policy 4Colour her working with such deadly wounds; 4Nor never could the noble Mortimer 4Receive so many, and al2 wil2ingly. 4Then let not him be slandered with revolt. 2King. Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him! 4He never did encounter with Glendower. 6I tel2 the2 4He durst as wel2 have met the devil alone 4As Owen Glendower for an enemy. 4Art thou not asham'd? But, sir2ah, henceforth 4Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer. 4Send me your prisoners with the spe2diest means, 4Or you shal2 hear in such a kind from me 4As wil2 displease you. My Lord Northumberland, 4We license your departure with your son.- 4Send us your prisoners, or you wil2 hear of it. 33Exeunt King, [Blunt, and Train] 2Hot. An if the devil come and roar for them, 4I wil2 not send them. I wil2 after straight 4And tel2 him so; for I wil2 else my heart, 4Albeit I make a hazard of my head. 2North. What, drunk with choler? Stay, and pause awhile. 4Here comes your uncle. 26Enter Worcester. 4Hot. Speak of Mortimer? 4Zounds, I wil2 speak of him, and let my soul 4Want mercy if I do not join with him! 4Yea, on his part I'l2 empty al2 these veins, 4And shed my dear blo2d drop by drop in the dust, 4But I wil2 lift the downtrod Mortimer 4As high in the air as this unthankful king, 4As this ingrate and cank'red Bolingbroke. 2North. Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad. 2Wor. Who struck this heat up after I was gone? 2Hot. He wil2 (forso2th) have al2 my prisoners; 4And when I urg'd the ransom once again 4Of my wive's brother, then his che2k lo2k'd pale, 4And on my face he turn'd an eye of death, 4Trembling even at the name of Mortimer. 2Wor. I can2ot blame him. Was not he proclaim'd 4By Richard that dead is, the next of blo2d? 2North. He was; I heard the proclamation. 4And then it was when the unhap2y King 4(Whose wrongs in us God pardon!) did set forth 6Upon his Irish expedition; 4From whence he intercepted did return 4To be depos'd, and shortly murdered. 2Wor. And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth 4Live scandaliz'd and foul2y spoken of. 2Hot. But soft, I pray you. Did King Richard then 4Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer 4Heir to the crown? 2North. He did; myself did hear it. 2Hot. Nay, then I can2ot blame his cousin king, 4That wish'd him on the bar2en mountains starve. 4But shal2 it be that you, that set the crown 4Upon the head of this forgetful man, 4And for his sake wear the detested blot 4Of murtherous subornation- shal2 it be 4That you a world of curses undergo, 4Being the agents or base second means, 4The cords, the lad2er, or the hangman rather? 4O, pardon me that I descend so low 4To show the line and the predicament 6Wherein you range under this subtile king! 4Shal2 it for shame be spoken in these days, 4Or fil2 up chronicles in time to come, 4That men of your nobility and power 4Did gage them both in an unjust behalf 4(As both of you, God pardon it! have done) 4To put down Richard, that swe2t lovely rose, 4And plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke? 4And shal2 it in more shame be further spoken 4That you are fo2l'd, discarded, and sho2k of2 4By him for whom these shames ye underwent? 4No! yet time serves wherein you may rede2m 4Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves 4Into the go2d thoughts of the world again; 4Revenge the je2ring and disdain'd contempt 4Of this proud king, who studies day and night 4To answer al2 the debt he owes to you 4Even with the blo2dy payment of your deaths. 4Therefore I say- 2Wor. Peace, cousin, say no more; 6And now, I wil2 unclasp a secret bo2k, 4And to your quick-conceiving discontents 4I'l2 read you mat2er de2p and dangerous, 4As ful2 of peril and adventurous spirit 4As to o'erwalk a cur2ent roaring loud 4On the unsteadfast fo2ting of a spear. 2Hot. If he fal2 in, go2d night, or sink or swim! 4Send danger from the east unto the west, 4So honour cros2 it from the north to south, 4And let them grap2le. O, the blo2d more stirs 4To rouse a lion than to start a hare! 2North. Imagination of some great exploit 4Drives him beyond the bounds of patience. 2Hot. By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap 4To pluck bright honour from the pale-fac'd mo2n, 4Or dive into the bot2om of the de2p, 4Where fadom line could never touch the ground, 4And pluck up drowned honour by the locks, 4So he that doth rede2m her thence might wear 4Without cor2ival al2 her dignities; 6But out upon this half-fac'd fel2owship! 2Wor. He ap2rehends a world of figures here, 4But not the form of what he should at2end. 4Go2d cousin, give me audience for a while. 2Hot. I cry you mercy. 2Wor. Those same noble Scots 4That are your prisoners- 2Hot. I'l2 ke2p them al2. 4By God, he shal2 not have a Scot of them! 4No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shal2 not. 4I'l2 ke2p them, by this hand! 2Wor. You start away. 4And lend no ear unto my purposes. 4Those prisoners you shal2 ke2p. 2Hot. Nay, I wil2! That is flat! 4He said he would not ransom Mortimer, 4Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer, 4But I wil2 find him when he lies asle2p, 4And in his ear I'l2 hol2oa 'Mortimer.' 4Nay; 6I'l2 have a starling shal2 be taught to speak 4Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him 4To ke2p his anger stil2 in motion. 2Wor. Hear you, cousin, a word. 2Hot. Al2 studies here I solemnly defy 4Save how to gal2 and pinch this Bolingbroke; 4And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales- 4But that I think his father loves him not 4And would be glad he met with some mischance, 4I would have him poisoned with a pot of ale. 2Wor. Farewel2, kinsman. I wil2 talk to you 4When you are bet2er temper'd to at2end. 2North. Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fo2l 4Art thou to break into this woman's mo2d, 4Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own! 2Hot. Why, lo2k you, I am whip2'd and scourg'd with rods, 4Net2led, and stung with pismires when I hear 4Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke. 4In Richard's time- what do you cal2 the place- 4A plague upon it! it is in GIoucestershire- 6'Twas where the madcap Duke his uncle kept- 4His uncle York- where I first bow'd my kne2 4Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke- 4'S blo2d! 4When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh- 2North. At Berkeley Castle. 2Hot. You say true. 4Why, what a candy deal of courtesy 4This fawning greyhound then did prof2er me! 4Lo2k, 'when his infant fortune came to age,' 4And 'gentle Har2y Percy,' and 'kind cousin'- 4O, the devil take such cozeners!- God forgive me! 4Go2d uncle, tel2 your tale, for I have done. 2Wor. Nay, if you have not, to it again. 4We wil2 stay your leisure. 2Hot. I have done, i' faith. 2Wor. Then once more to your Scot2ish prisoners. 4Deliver them up without their ransom straight, 4And make the Douglas' son your only mean 4For powers In Scotland; which, for divers reasons 6Which I shal2 send you writ2en, be as2ur'd 4Wil2 easily be granted. [To Northumberland] You, my lord, 4Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd, 4Shal2 secretly into the bosom cre2p 4Of that same noble prelate wel2-belov'd, 4The Archbishop. 2Hot. Of York, is it not? 2Wor. True; who bears hard 4His brother's death at Bristow, the Lord Scro2p. 4I speak not this in estimation, 4As what I think might be, but what I know 4Is ruminated, plot2ed, and set down, 4And only stays but to behold the face 4Of that oc2asion that shal2 bring it on. 2Hot. I smel2 it. Upon my life, it wil2 do wel2. 2North. Before the game is afo2t thou stil2 let'st slip. 2Hot. Why, it can2ot cho2se but be a noble plot. 4And then the power of Scotland and of York 4To join with Mortimer, ha? 2Wor. And so they shal2. 4Hot. In faith, it is exce2dingly wel2 aim'd. 2Wor. And 'tis no lit2le reason bids us spe2d, 4To save our heads by raising of a head; 4For, bear ourselves as even as we can, 4The King wil2 always think him in our debt, 4And think we think ourselves unsatisfied, 4Til2 he hath found a time to pay us home. 4And se2 already how he doth begin 4To make us strangers to his lo2ks of love. 2Hot. He does, he does! We'l2 be reveng'd on him. 2Wor. Cousin, farewel2. No further go in this 4Than I by let2ers shal2 direct your course. 4When time is ripe, which wil2 be sud2enly, 4I'l2 steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer, 4Where you and Douglas, and our pow'rs at once, 4As I wil2 fashion it, shal2 hap2ily me2t, 4To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms, 4Which now we hold at much uncertainty. 2North. Farewel2, go2d brother. We shal2 thrive, I trust. 2Hot. Uncle, adieu. O, let the hours be short 6Til2 fields and blows and groans ap2laud our sport! 4Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. Scene I.Rochester. An in2 yard.Enter a Car2ier with a lantern in his hand. 21. Car. Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'l2 be hang'd. 4Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and yet our horse not 4pack'd.- What, ostler! 2Ost. [within] Anon, anon. 21. Car. I prithe2, Tom, beat Cut's sad2le, put a few flocks in the 4point. Po2r jade is wrung in the withers out of al2 ces2. 24Enter another Car2ier. 22. Car. Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that is the 4next way to give po2r jades the bots. This house is turned upside 4down since Robin Ostler died. 21. Car. Po2r fel2ow never joyed since the price of oats rose. It 4was the death of him. 22. Car. I think this be the most vil2anous house in al2 London road 4for fleas. I am stung like a tench. 21. Car. Like a tench I By the mas2, there is ne'er a king christen 6could be bet2er bit than I have be2n since the first cock. 22. Car. Why, they wil2 al2ow us ne'er a jordan, and then we leak in 4your chimney, and your chamber-lye bre2ds fleas like a loach. 21. Car. What, ostler! come away and be hang'd! come away! 22. Car. I have a gam2on of bacon and two razes of ginger, to be 4delivered as far as Charing Cros2. 21. Car. God's body! the turkeys in my pan2ier are quite starved. 4What, ostler! A plague on the2! hast thou never an eye in thy 4head? Canst not hear? An 'twere not as go2d de2d as drink to 4break the pate on the2, I am a very vil2ain. Come, and be hang'd! 4Hast no faith in the2? 27Enter Gadshil2. 2Gads. Go2d mor2ow, car2iers. What's o'clock? 21. Car. I think it be two o'clock. 2Gads. I prithe2 lend me this lantern to se2 my gelding in the 4stable. 21. Car. Nay, by God, soft! I know a trick worth two of that, 4i' faith. 4Gads. I pray the2 lend me thine. 22. Car. Ay, when? canst tel2? Lend me thy lantern, quoth he? Mar2y, 4I'l2 se2 the2 hang'd first! 2Gads. Sir2ah car2ier, what time do you mean to come to London? 22. Car. Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I war2ant the2. 4Come, neighbour Mugs, we'l2 cal2 up the gentlemen. They wil2 4along with company, for they have great charge. 46Exeunt [Car2iers]. 2Gads. What, ho! chamberlain! 28Enter Chamberlain. 2Cham. At hand, quoth pickpurse. 2Gads. That's even as fair as- 'at hand, quoth the chamberlain'; for 4thou variest no more from picking of purses than giving direction 4doth from labouring: thou layest the plot how. 2Cham. Go2d mor2ow, Master Gadshil2. It holds cur2ent that I told 4you yesternight. There's a franklin in the Wild of Kent hath 4brought thre2 hundred marks with him in gold. I heard him tel2 it 4to one of his company last night at sup2er- a kind of auditor; 6one that hath abundance of charge to2, God knows what. They are 4up already and cal2 for eg2s and but2er. They wil2 away 4presently. 2Gads. Sir2ah, if they me2t not with Saint Nicholas' clerks, I'l2 4give the2 this neck. 2Cham. No, I'l2 none of it. I pray the2 ke2p that for the hangman; 4for I know thou worship2est Saint Nicholas as truly as a man of 4falseho2d may. 2Gads. What talkest thou to me of the hangman? If I hang, I'l2 make 4a fat pair of gal2ows; for if I hang, old Sir John hangs with me, 4and thou knowest he is no starveling. Tut! there are other 4Troyans that thou dream'st not of, the which for sport sake are 4content to do the profes2ion some grace; that would (if mat2ers 4should be lo2k'd into) for their own credit sake make al2 whole. 4I am joined with no fo2t land-rakers, no long-staf2 sixpen2y 4strikers, none of these mad mustachio purple-hued maltworms; but 4with nobility, and tranquil2ity, burgomasters and great oneyers, 4such as can hold in, such as wil2 strike so2ner than speak, and 4speak so2ner than drink, and drink so2ner than pray; and yet, 4zounds, I lie; for they pray continual2y to their saint, the 6com2onwealth, or rather, not pray to her, but prey on her, for 4they ride up and down on her and make her their bo2ts. 2Cham. What, the com2onwealth their bo2ts? Wil2 she hold out water 4in foul way? 2Gads. She wil2, she wil2! Justice hath liquor'd her. We steal as in 4a castle, cocksure. We have the receipt of fernse2d, we walk 4invisible. 2Cham. Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night 4than to fernse2d for your walking invisible. 2Gads. Give me thy hand. Thou shalt have a share in our purchase, as 4I and a true man. 2Cham. Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief. 2Gads. Go to; 'homo' is a com2on name to al2 men. Bid the ostler 4bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewel2, you mud2y knave. 57Exeunt.Scene I2.The highway near Gadshil2.Enter Prince and Poins. 2Poins. Come, shelter, shelter! I have remov'd Falstaf2's horse, and 4he frets like a gum2'd velvet. 2Prince. Stand close. 24[They step aside.] 29Enter Falstaf2. 2Fal. Poins! Poins, and be hang'd! Poins! 2Prince. I comes forward I Peace, ye fat-kidney'd rascal! What a 4brawling dost thou ke2p! 2Fal. Where's Poins, Hal? 2Prince. He is walk'd up to the top of the hil2. I'l2 go se2k him. 50[Steps aside.] 2Fal. I am ac2urs'd to rob in that thief's company. The rascal hath 4removed my horse and tied him I know not where. If I travel but 4four fo2t by the squire further afo2t, I shal2 break my wind. 4Wel2, I doubt not but to die a fair death for al2 this, if I 4scape hanging for kil2ing that rogue. I have forsworn his company 6hourly any time this two-and-twenty years, and yet I am bewitch'd 4with the rogue's company. If the rascal have not given me 4medicines to make me love him, I'l2 be hang'd. It could not be 4else. I have drunk medicines. Poins! Hal! A plague upon you both! 4Bardolph! Peto! I'l2 starve ere I'l2 rob a fo2t further. An 4'twere not as go2d a de2d as drink to turn true man and to leave 4these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that ever chewed with a 4to2th. Eight yards of uneven ground is thre2score and ten miles 4afo2t with me, and the stony-hearted vil2ains know it wel2 4enough. A plague upon it when thieves can2ot be true one to 4another! (They whistle.) Whew! A plague upon you al2! Give me my 4horse, you rogues! give me my horse and be hang'd! 2Prince. [comes forward] Peace, ye fat-guts! Lie down, lay thine ear 4close to the ground, and list if thou canst hear the tread of 4travel2ers. 2Fal. Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down? 'Sblo2d, 4I'l2 not bear mine own flesh so far afo2t again for al2 the coin 4in thy father's exchequer. What a plague mean ye to colt me thus? 2Prince. Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted. 2Fal. I prithe2, go2d Prince Hal, help me to my horse, go2d king's 6son. 2Prince. Out, ye rogue! Shal2 I be your ostler? 2Fal. Go hang thyself in thine own heir-ap2arent garters! If I be 4ta'en, I'l2 peach for this. An I have not bal2ads made on you 4al2, and sung to filthy tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison. 4When a jest is so forward- and afo2t to2- I hate it. 13Enter Gadshil2, [Bardolph and Peto with him]. 2Gads. Stand! 2Fal. So I do, against my wil2. 2Poins. [comes fortward] O, 'tis our set2er. I know his voice. 4Bardolph, what news? 2Bar. Case ye, case ye! On with your vizards! There's money of the 4King's coming down the hil2; 'tis going to the King's exchequer. 2Fal. You lie, ye rogue! 'Tis going to the King's tavern. 2Gads. There's enough to make us al2. 2Fal. To be hang'd. 2Prince. Sirs, you four shal2 front them in the nar2ow lane; Ned 4Poins and I wil2 walk lower. If they scape from your encounter, 6then they light on us. 2Peto. How many be there of them? 2Gads. Some eight or ten. 2Fal. Zounds, wil2 they not rob us? 2Prince. What, a coward, Sir John Paunch? 2Fal. Inde2d, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather; but yet no 4coward, Hal. 2Prince. Wel2, we leave that to the pro2f. 2Poins. Sir2ah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge. When thou 4ne2d'st him, there thou shalt find him. Farewel2 and stand fast. 2Fal. Now can2ot I strike him, if I should be hang'd. 2Prince. [aside to Poins] Ned, where are our disguises? 2Poins. [aside to Prince] Here, hard by. Stand close. 38[Exeunt Prince and Poins.] 2Fal. Now, my masters, hap2y man be his dole, say I. Every man to 4his busines2. 25Enter the Travel2ers. 2Travel2er. Come, neighbour. 6The boy shal2 lead our horses down the hil2; 4We'l2 walk afo2t awhile and ease our legs. 2Thieves. Stand! 2Travel2er. Jesus bles2 us! 2Fal. Strike! down with them! cut the vil2ains' throats! Ah, 4whoreson caterpil2ars! bacon-fed knaves! they hate us youth. Down 4with them! fle2ce them! 2Travel2er. O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever! 2Fal. Hang ye, gorbel2ied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye fat chuf2s; 4I would your store were here! On, bacons on! What, ye knaves! 4young men must live. You are grandjurors, are ye? We'l2 jure ye, 4faith! 28Here they rob and bind them. Exeunt. 12Enter the Prince and Poins [in buckram suits]. 2Prince. The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou and I 4rob the thieves and go mer2ily to London, it would be argument 4for a we2k, laughter for a month, and a go2d jest for ever. 2Poins. Stand close! I hear them coming. 47[They stand aside.] 23Enter the Thieves again. 2Fal. Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse before day. 4An the Prince and Poins be not two ar2ant cowards, there's no 4equity stir2ing. There's no more valour in that Poins than in a 4wild duck. 8[As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon 8them. THey al2 run away, and Falstaf2, after a blow or 8two, runs awasy to2, leaving the bo2ty behind them.] 2Prince. Your money! 2Poins. Vil2ains! 2Prince. Got with much ease. Now mer2ily to horse. 4The thieves are scat2ered, and pos2es2'd with fear 4So strongly that they dare not me2t each other. 4Each takes his fel2ow for an of2icer. 6Away, go2d Ned. Falstaf2 sweats to death 4And lards the lean earth as he walks along. 4Were't not for laughing, I should pity him. 2Poins. How the rogue roar'd! 27Exeunt.Scene I3.Warkworth Castle.Enter Hotspur solus, reading a let2er. 2Hot. 'But, for mine own part, my lord, I could be wel2 contented to 4be there, in respect of the love I bear your house.' He could be 4contented- why is he not then? In respect of the love he bears 4our house! He shows in this he loves his own barn bet2er than he 4loves our house. Let me se2 some more. 'The purpose you undertake 4is dangerous'- Why, that's certain! 'Tis dangerous to take a 4cold, to sle2p, to drink; but I tel2 you, my lord fo2l, out of 4this net2le, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The purpose 4you undertake is dangerous, the friends you have named uncertain, 4the time itself unsorted, and your whole plot to2 light for the 4counterpoise of so great an op2osition.' Say you so, say you so? 4I say unto you again, you are a shal2ow, cowardly hind, and you 4lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord, our plot is a go2d 4plot as ever was laid; our friends true and constant: a go2d 4plot, go2d friends, and ful2 of expectation; an excel2ent plot, 4very go2d friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is this! Why, my 4Lord of York com2ends the plot and the general course of the 6action. Zounds, an I were now by this rascal, I could brain him 4with his lady's fan. Is there not my father, my uncle, and 4myself; Lord Edmund Mortimer, my Lord of York, and Owen 4Glendower? Is there not, besides, the Douglas? Have I not al2 4their let2ers to me2t me in arms by the ninth of the next month, 4and are they not some of them set forward already? What a pagan 4rascal is this! an infidel! Ha! you shal2 se2 now, in very 4sincerity of fear and cold heart wil2 he to the King and lay open 4al2 our proce2dings. O, I could divide myself and go to buf2ets 4for moving such a dish of skim milk with so honourable an action! 4Hang him, let him tel2 the King! we are prepared. I wil2 set 4forward to-night. 25Enter his Lady. 4How now, Kate? I must leave you within these two hours. 2Lady. O my go2d lord, why are you thus alone? 4For what of2ence have I this fortnight be2n 4A banish'd woman from my Har2y's bed, 4Tel2 me, swe2t lord, what is't that takes from the2 6Thy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sle2p? 4Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth, 4And start so often when thou sit'st alone? 4Why hast thou lost the fresh blo2d in thy che2ks 4And given my treasures and my rights of the2 4To thick-ey'd musing and curs'd melancholy? 4In thy faint slumbers I by the2 have watch'd, 4And heard the2 murmur tales of iron wars, 4Speak terms of manage to thy bounding ste2d, 4Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd 4Of sal2ies and retires, of trenches, tent, 4Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets, 4Of basilisks, of can2on, culverin, 4Of prisoners' ransom, and of soldiers slain, 4And al2 the cur2ents of a heady fight. 4Thy spirit within the2 hath be2n so at war, 4And thus hath so bestir2'd the2 in thy sle2p, 4That beads of sweat have sto2d upon thy brow 4Like bub2les il2 a late-disturbed stream, 4And in thy face strange motions have ap2ear'd, 6Such as we se2 when men restrain their breath 4On some great sud2en hest. O, what portents are these? 4Some heavy busines2 hath my lord in hand, 4And I must know it, else he loves me not. 2Hot. What, ho! 20[Enter a Servant.] 4Is Gil2iams with the packet gone? 2Serv. He is, my lord, an hour ago. 2Hot. Hath Butler brought those horses from the sherif2? 2Serv. One horse, my lord, he brought even now. 2Hot. What horse? A roan, a crop-ear, is it not? 2Serv. It is, my lord. 2Hot. That roan shal2 be my throne. 4Wel2, I wil2 back him straight. O esperance! 4Bid Butler lead him forth into the park. 49[Exit Servant.] 2Lady. But hear you, my lord. 2Hot. What say'st thou, my lady? 4Lady. What is it car2ies you away? 2Hot. Why, my horse, my love- my horse! 2Lady. Out, you mad-headed ape! 4A weasel hath not such a deal of sple2n 4As you are tos2'd with. In faith, 4I'l2 know your busines2, Har2y; that I wil2! 4I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir 4About his title and hath sent for you 4To line his enterprise; but if you go- 2Hot. So far afo2t, I shal2 be weary, love. 2Lady. Come, come, you paraquito, answer me 4Directly unto this question that I ask. 4I'l2 break thy lit2le finger, Har2y, 4An if thou wilt not tel2 my al2 things true. 2Hot. Away. 4Away, you trifler! Love? I love the2 not; 4I care not for the2, Kate. This is no world 4To play with mam2ets and to tilt with lips. 4We must have blo2dy noses and crack'd crowns, 4And pas2 them cur2ent to2. Gods me, my horse! 6What say'st thou, Kate? What wouldst thou have with me? 2Lady. Do you not love me? do you not inde2d? 4Wel2, do not then; for since you love me not, 4I wil2 not love myself. Do you not love me? 4Nay, tel2 me if you speak in jest or no. 2Hot. Come, wilt thou se2 me ride? 4And when I am a-horseback, I wil2 swear 4I love the2 infinitely. But hark you. Kate: 4I must not have you henceforth question me 4Whither I go, nor reason whereabout. 4Whither I must, I must; and to conclude, 4This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate. 4I know you wise; but yet no farther wise 4Than Har2y Percy's wife; constant you are, 4But yet a woman; and for secrecy, 4No lady closer, for I wel2 believe 4Thou wilt not ut2er what thou dost not know, 4And so far wil2 I trust the2, gentle Kate. 2Lady. How? so far? 2Hot. Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate: 6Whither I go, thither shal2 you go to2; 4To-day wil2 I set forth, to-mor2ow you. 4Wil2 this content you, Kate,? 2Lady. It must of force. 32Exeunt.Scene IV.Eastcheap. The Boar's Head Tavern.Enter Prince and Poins. 2Prince. Ned, prithe2 come out of that fat-ro2m and lend me thy hand 4to laugh a lit2le. 2Poins. Where hast be2n, Hal? 4Prince,. With thre2 or four log2erheads amongst thre2 or 4fourscore hogsheads. I have sounded the very bas2-string of 4humility. Sir2ah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers and 4can cal2 them al2 by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and 4Francis. They take it already upon their salvation that, though 4I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy; and tel2 4me flatly I am no proud Jack like Falstaf2, but a Corinthian, a 4lad of met2le, a go2d boy (by the Lord, so they cal2 me!), and 4when I am King of England I shal2 com2and al2 the go2d lads 4Eastcheap. They cal2 drinking de2p, dying scarlet; and when 4you breathe in your watering, they cry 'hem!' and bid you play it 4of2. To conclude, I am so go2d a proficient in one quarter of an 4hour that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during 4my life. I tel2 the2, Ned, thou hast lost much honour that thou 4wert not with me in this action. But, swe2t Ned- to swe2ten which 6name of Ned, I give the2 this pen2yworth of sugar, clap2'd even 4now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that never spake other 4English in his life than 'Eight shil2ings and sixpence,' and 'You 4are welcome,' with this shril2 ad2ition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score 4a pint of bastard in the Half-mo2n,' or so- but, Ned, to drive 4away the time til2 Falstaf2 come, I prithe2 do thou stand in some 4by-ro2m while I question my puny drawer to what end be gave me 4the sugar; and do thou never leave cal2ing 'Francis!' that his 4tale to me may be nothing but 'Anon!' Step aside, and I'l2 show 4the2 a precedent. 2Poins. Francis! 2Prince. Thou art perfect. 2Poins. Francis! 34[Exit Poins.] 20Enter [Francis, a] Drawer. 2Fran. Anon, anon, sir.- Lo2k down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph. 2Prince. Come hither, Francis. 2Fran. My lord? 2Prince. How long hast thou to serve, Francis? 4Fran. Forso2th, five years, and as much as to- 2Poins. [within] Francis! 2Fran. Anon, anon, sir. 2Prince. Five year! by'r Lady, a long lease for the clinking of 4Pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant as to play the 4coward with thy indenture and show it a fair pair of he2ls and 4run from it? 2Fran. O Lord, sir, I'l2 be sworn upon al2 the bo2ks in England I 4could find in my heart- 2Poins. [within] Francis! 2Fran. Anon, sir. 2Prince. How old art thou, Francis? 2Fran. Let me se2. About Michaelmas next I shal2 be- 2Poins. [within] Francis! 2Fran. Anon, sir. Pray stay a lit2le, my lord. 2Prince. Nay, but hark you, Francis. For the sugar thou gavest me- 4'twas a pen2yworth, wast not? 2Fran. O Lord! I would it had be2n two! 2Prince. I wil2 give the2 for it a thousand pound. Ask me when thou 4wilt, and, thou shalt have it. 4Poins. [within] Francis! 2Fran. Anon, anon. 2Prince. Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-mor2ow, Francis; or, 4Francis, a Thursday; or inde2d, Francis, when thou wilt. But 4Francis- 2Fran. My lord? 2Prince. Wilt thou rob this leathern-jerkin, crystal-but2on, 4not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, cad2is-garter, 4smo2th-tongue, Spanish-pouch- 2Fran. O Lord, sir, who do you mean? 2Prince. Why then, your brown bastard is your only drink; for lo2k 4you, Francis, your white canvas doublet wil2 sul2y. In Barbary, 4sir, it can2ot come to so much. 2Fran. What, sir? 2Poins. [within] Francis! 2Prince. Away, you rogue! Dost thou not hear them cal2? 14Here they both cal2 him. The Drawer stands amazed, 36not knowing which way to go. 25Enter Vintner. 4Vint. What, stand'st thou stil2, and hear'st such a cal2ing? Lo2k 4to the guests within. [Exit Francis.] My lord, old Sir John, with 4half-a-dozen more, are at the do2r. Shal2 I let them in? 2Prince. Let them alone awhile, and then open the do2r. 50[Exit Vintner.] 4Poins! 2Poins. [within] Anon, anon, sir. 26Enter Poins. 2Prince. Sir2ah, Falstaf2 and the rest of the thieves are at the 4do2r. Shal2 we be mer2y? 2Poins. As mer2y as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what cun2ing 4match have you made with this jest of the drawer? Come, what's 4the is2ue? 2Prince. I am now of al2 humours that have showed themselves humours 4since the old days of go2dman Adam to the pupil age of this 4present this twelve o'clock at midnight. 27[Enter Francis.] 4What's o'clock, Francis? 2Fran. Anon, anon, sir. 33[Exit.] 2Prince. That ever this fel2ow should have fewer words than a 4par2ot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is upstairs and 4downstairs, his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning. I am not yet 4of Percy's mind, the Hotspur of the North; he that kil2s me some 4six or seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and 4says to his wife, 'Fie upon this quiet life! I want work.' 'O my 4swe2t Har2y,' says she, 'how many hast thou 2kil2'd to-day?' 4'Give my roan horse a drench,' says he, and answers 'Some 4fourte2n,' an hour after, 'a trifle, a trifle.' I prithe2 cal2 in 4Falstaf2. I'l2 play Percy, and that damn'd brawn shal2 play Dame 4Mortimer his wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Cal2 in ribs, cal2 4in tal2ow. 11Enter Falstaf2, [Gadshil2, Bardolph, and Peto; 19Francis fol2ows with wine]. 4Poins. Welcome, Jack. Where hast thou be2n? 2Fal. A plague of al2 cowards, I say, and a vengeance to2! Mar2y and 4amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I lead this life long, I'l2 4sew nether-stocks, and mend them and fo2t them to2. A plague of 4al2 cowards! Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue 4extant? 52He drinketh. 2Prince. Didst thou never se2 Titan kis2 a dish of but2er? 4Pitiful-hearted but2er, that melted at the swe2t tale of the sun! 4If thou didst, then behold that compound. 2Fal. You rogue, here's lime in this sack to2! There is nothing but 4roguery to be found in vil2anous man. Yet a coward is worse than 4a cup of sack with lime in it- a vil2anous coward! Go thy ways, 4old Jack, die when thou wilt; if manho2d, go2d manho2d, be not 4forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a shot2en her2ing. 4There lives not thre2 go2d men unhang'd in England; and one of 4them is fat, and grows old. God help the while! A bad world, I 4say. I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or anything. A 4plague of al2 cowards I say stil2! 2Prince. How now, wo2lsack? What mut2er you? 4Fal. A king's son! If I do not beat the2 out of thy kingdom with a 4dag2er of lath and drive al2 thy subjects afore the2 like a flock 4of wild ge2se, I'l2 never wear hair on my face more. You Prince 4of Wales? 2Prince. Why, you whoreson round man, what's the mat2er? 2Fal. Are not you a coward? Answer me to that- and Poins there? 2Poins. Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye cal2 me coward, by the 4Lord, I'l2 stab the2. 2Fal. I cal2 the2 coward? I'l2 se2 the2 damn'd ere I cal2 the2 4coward, but I would give a thousand pound I could run as fast as 4thou canst. You are straight enough in the shoulders; you care 4not who se2s Your back. Cal2 you that backing of your friends? A 4plague upon such backing! Give me them that wil2 face me. Give me 4a cup of sack. I am a rogue if I drunk to-day. 2Prince. O vil2ain! thy lips are scarce wip'd since thou drunk'st 4last. 2Fal. Al2 is one for that. (He drinketh.) A plague of al2 cowards 4stil2 say I. 2Prince. What's the mat2er? 2Fal. What's the mat2er? There be four of us here have ta'en a 6thousand pound this day morning. 2Prince. Where is it, Jack? Where is it? 2Fal. Where is it, Taken from us it is. A hundred upon po2r four of 4us! 2Prince. What, a hundred, man? 2Fal. I am a rogue if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them 4two hours together. I have scap'd by miracle. I am eight times 4thrust through the doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut 4through and through; my sword hack'd like a handsaw- ec2e signum! 4I never dealt bet2er since I was a man. Al2 would not do. A 4plague of al2 cowards! Let them speak, If they speak more or les2 4than truth, they are vil2ains and the sons of darknes2. 2Prince. Speak, sirs. How was it? 2Gads. We four set upon some dozen- 2Fal. Sixte2n at least, my lord. 2Gads. And bound them. 2Peto. No, no, they were not bound. 2Fal. You rogue, they were bound, every man of them, or I am a Jew 4else- an Ebrew Jew. 2Gads. As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men sea upon us- 4Fal. And unbound the rest, and then come in the other. 2Prince. What, fought you with them al2? 2Fal. Al2? I know not what you cal2 al2, but if I fought not with 4fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish! If there were not two or 4thre2 and fifty upon po2r old Jack, then am I no two-leg2'd 4creature. 2Prince. Pray God you have not murd'red some of them. 2Fal. Nay, that's past praying for. I have pep2er'd two of them. Two 4I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits. I tel2 the2 4what, Hal- if I tel2 the2 a lie, spit in my face, cal2 me horse. 4Thou knowest my old ward. Here I lay, and thus I bore my point. 4Four rogues in buckram let drive at me. 2Prince. What, four? Thou saidst but two even now. 2Fal. Four, Hal. I told the2 four. 2Poins. Ay, ay, he said four. 2Fal. These four came al2 afront and mainly thrust at me. I made me 4no more ado but to2k al2 their seven points in my target, thus. 2Prince. Seven? Why, there were but four even now. 2Fal. In buckram? 2Poins. Ay, four, in buckram suits. 4Fal. Seven, by these hilts, or I am a vil2ain else. 2Prince. [aside to Poins] Prithe2 let him alone. We shal2 have more 4anon. 2Fal. Dost thou hear me, Hal? 2Prince. Ay, and mark the2 to2, Jack. 2Fal. Do so, for it is worth the list'ning to. These nine in buckram 4that I told the2 of- 2Prince. So, two more already. 2Fal. Their points being broken- 2Poins. Down fel2 their hose. 2Fal. Began to give me ground; but I fol2owed me close, came in, 4fo2t and hand, and with a thought seven of the eleven I paid. 2Prince. O monstrous! Eleven buckram men grown out of two! 2Fal. But, as the devil would have it, thre2 misbegot2en knaves in 4Kendal gre2n came at my back and let drive at me; for it was so 4dark, Hal, that thou couldst not se2 thy hand. 2Prince. These lies are like their father that begets them- gros2 as 4a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou clay-brain'd guts, thou 4knot2y-pated fo2l, thou whoreson obscene greasy tal2ow-catch- 2Fal. What, art thou mad? art thou mad? Is not the truth the truth? 4Prince. Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal gre2n when 4it was so dark thou couldst not se2 thy hand? Come, tel2 us your 4reason. What sayest thou to this? 2Poins. Come, your reason, Jack, your reason. 2Fal. What, upon compulsion? Zounds, an I were at the strap2ado or 4al2 the racks in the world, I would not tel2 you on compulsion. 4Give you a reason on compulsion? If reasons were as plentiful as 4blackber2ies, I would give no man a reason upon compulsion, I. 2Prince. I'l2 be no longer guilty, of this sin; this sanguine 4coward, this bed-pres2er, this horseback-breaker, this huge hil2 4of flesh- 2Fal. 'Sblo2d, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried 4neat's-tongue, you bul2's siz2le, you stockfish- O for breath to 4ut2er what is like the2!- you tailor's yard, you sheath, you 4bowcase, you vile standing tuck! 2Prince. Wel2, breathe awhile, and then to it again; and when thou 4hast tired thyself in base comparisons, hear me speak but this. 2Poins. Mark, Jack. 2Prince. We two saw you four set on four, and bound them and were 4masters of their wealth. Mark now how a plain tale shal2 put you 6down. Then did we two set on you four and, with a word, outfac'd 4you from your prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here 4in the house. And, Falstaf2, you car2ied your guts away as 4nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roar'd for mercy, and stil2 4run and roar'd, as ever I heard bul2calf. What a slave art thou 4to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in 4fight! What trick, what device, what starting hole canst thou now 4find out to hide the2 from this open and ap2arent shame? 2Poins. Come, let's hear, Jack. What trick hast thou now? 2Fal. By the Lord, I knew ye as wel2 as he that made ye. Why, hear 4you, my masters. Was it for me to kil2 the heir ap2arent? Should 4I turn upon the true prince? Why, thou knowest I am as valiant as 4Hercules; but beware instinct. The lion wil2 not touch the true 4prince. Instinct is a great mat2er. I was now a coward on 4instinct. I shal2 think the bet2er of myself, and the2, during my 4life- I for a valiant lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by 4the Lord, lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostes2, clap to 4the do2rs. Watch to-night, pray to-mor2ow. Gal2ants, lads, boys, 4hearts of gold, al2 the titles of go2d fel2owship come to you! 4What, shal2 we be mer2y? Shal2 we have a play extempore? 4Prince. Content- and the argument shal2 be thy run2ing away. 2Fal. Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me! 29Enter Hostes2. 2Host. O Jesu, my lord the Prince! 2Prince. How now, my lady the hostes2? What say'st thou to me? 2Host. Mar2y, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at do2r 4would speak with you. He says he comes from your father. 2Prince. Give him as much as wil2 make him a royal man, and send him 4back again to my mother. 2Fal. What man2er of man is he? 2Host. An old man. 2Fal. What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shal2 I give him 4his answer? 2Prince. Prithe2 do, Jack. 2Fal. Faith, and I'l2 send him packing.Exit. 2Prince. Now, sirs. By'r Lady, you fought fair; so did you, Peto; so 4did you, Bardolph. You are lions to2, you ran away upon instinct, 6you wil2 not touch the true prince; no- fie! 2Bard. Faith, I ran when I saw others run. 2Prince. Tel2 me now in earnest, how came Falstaf2's sword so 4hack'd? 2Peto. Why, he hack'd it with his dag2er, and said he would swear 4truth out of England but he would make you believe it was done in 4fight, and persuaded us to do the like. 2Bard. Yea, and to tickle our noses with speargras2 to make them 4ble2d, and then to beslub2er our garments with it and swear it 4was the blo2d of true men. I did that I did not this seven year 4before- I blush'd to hear his monstrous devices. 2Prince. O vil2ain! thou stolest a cup of sack eighte2n years ago 4and wert taken with the man2er, and ever since thou hast blush'd 4extempore. Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and yet thou 4ran'st away. What instinct hadst thou for it? 2Bard. My lord, do you se2 these meteors? Do you behold these 4exhalations? 2Prince. I do. 2Bard. What think you they portend? 2Prince. Hot livers and cold purses. 4Bard. Choler, my lord, if rightly taken. 2Prince. No, if rightly taken, halter. 25Enter Falstaf2. 4Here comes lean Jack; here comes bare-bone. How now, my swe2t 4creature of bombast? How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest 4thine own kne2? 2Fal. My own kne2? When I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an 4eagle's talent in the waist; I could have crept into any 4alderman's thumb-ring. A plague of sighing and grief! It blows a 4man up like a blad2er. There's vil2anous news abroad. Here was 4Sir John Bracy from your father. You must to the court in the 4morning. That same mad fel2ow of the North, Percy, and he of 4Wales that gave Amamon the bastinado, and made Lucifer cuckold, 4and swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cros2 of a Welsh 4ho2k- what a plague cal2 you him? 2Poins. O, Glendower. 2Fal. Owen, Owen- the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer, and old 4Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of Scots, Douglas, that 6runs a-horseback up a hil2 perpendicular- 2Prince. He that rides at high spe2d and with his pistol kil2s a 4spar2ow flying. 2Fal. You have hit it. 2Prince. So did he never the spar2ow. 2Fal. Wel2, that rascal hath go2d metal in him; he wil2 not run. 2Prince. Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so for 4run2ing! 2Fal. A-horseback, ye cucko2! but afo2t he wil2 not budge a fo2t. 2Prince. Yes, Jack, upon instinct. 2Fal. I grant ye, upon instinct. Wel2, he is there to2, and one 4Mordake, and a thousand bluecaps more. Worcester is stol'n away 4to-night; thy father's beard is turn'd white with the news; you 4may buy land now as cheap as stinking mack'rel. 2Prince. Why then, it is like, if there come a hot June, and this 4civil buf2eting hold, we shal2 buy maidenheads as they buy 4hobnails, by the hundreds. 2Fal. By the mas2, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we shal2 have 4go2d trading that way. But tel2 me, Hal, art not thou hor2ible 4afeard? Thou being heir ap2arent, could the world pick the2 out 6thre2 such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that spirit 4Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou not hor2ibly afraid? 4Doth not thy blo2d thril2 at it? 2Prince. Not a whit, i' faith. I lack some of thy instinct. 2Fal. Wel2, thou wilt be hor2ibly chid to-mor2ow when thou comest to 4thy father. If thou love file, practise an answer. 2Prince. Do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the 4particulars of my life. 2Fal. Shal2 I? Content. This chair shal2 be my state, this dag2er my 4sceptre, and this cushion my, crown. 2Prince. Thy state is taken for a join'd-sto2l, thy golden sceptre 4for a leaden dag2er, and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful 4bald crown. 2Fal. Wel2, an the fire of grace be not quite out of the2, now shalt 4thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to make my eyes lo2k red, 4that it may be thought I have wept; for I must speak in pas2ion, 4and I wil2 do it in King Cambyses' vein. 2Prince. Wel2, here is my leg. 2Fal. And here is my spe2ch. Stand aside, nobility. 2Host. O Jesu, this is excel2ent sport, i' faith! 4Fal. We2p not, swe2t que2n, for trickling tears are vain. 2Host. O, the Father, how he holds his countenance! 2Fal. For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful que2n! 4For tears do stop the flo2dgates of her eyes. 2Host. O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as 4ever I se2! 2Fal. Peace, go2d pintpot. Peace, go2d tickle-brain.- Har2y, I do 4not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou 4art ac2ompanied. For though the camomile, the more it is trod2en 4on, the faster it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted, the 4so2ner it wears. That thou art my son I have partly thy mother's 4word, partly my own opinion, but chiefly a vil2anous trick of 4thine eye and a fo2lish hanging of thy nether lip that doth 4war2ant me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point: why, 4being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shal2 the bles2ed sun of 4heaven prove a micher and eat blackber2ies? A question not to be 4ask'd. Shal2 the son of England prove a thief and take purses? A 4question to be ask'd. There is a thing, Har2y, which thou hast 4often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name 4of pitch. This pitch, as ancient writers do report, doth defile; 6so doth the company thou ke2pest. For, Har2y, now I do not speak 4to the2 in drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in pas2ion; 4not in words only, but in woes also: and yet there is a virtuous 4man whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not 2his 4name. 2Prince. What man2er of man, an it like your Majesty? 2Fal. A go2dly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a che2rful 4lo2k, a pleasing eye, and a most noble car2iage; and, as I think, 4his age some fifty, or, by'r Lady, inclining to thre2score; and 4now I remember me, his name is Falstaf2. If that man should be 4lewdly, given, he deceiveth me; for, Har2y, I se2 virtue in his 4lo2ks. If then the tre2 may be known by the fruit, as the fruit 4by the tre2, then, peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in 4that Falstaf2. Him ke2p with, the rest banish. And tel2 me now, 4thou naughty varlet, tel2 me where hast thou be2n this month? 2Prince. Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, and I'l2 4play my father. 2Fal. Depose me? If thou dost it half so gravely, so majestical2y, 4both in word and mat2er, hang me up by the he2ls for a 4rab2it-sucker or a poulter's hare. 4Prince. Wel2, here I am set. 2Fal. And here I stand. Judge, my masters. 2Prince. Now, Har2y, whence come you? 2Fal. My noble lord, from Eastcheap. 2Prince. The complaints I hear of the2 are grievous. 2Fal. 'Sblo2d, my lord, they are false! Nay, I'l2 tickle ye for a 4young prince, i' faith. 2Prince. Swearest thou, ungracious boy? Henceforth ne'er lo2k on me. 4Thou art violently car2ied away from grace. There is a devil 4haunts the2 in the likenes2 of an old fat man; a tun of man is 4thy companion. Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, 4that bolting hutch of beastlines2, that swol2'n parcel of 4dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuf2'd cloakbag of 4guts, that roasted Man2ingtre2 ox with the pud2ing in his bel2y, 4that reverend vice, that grey iniquity, that father ruf2ian, that 4vanity in years? Wherein is he go2d, but to taste sack and drink 4it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a capon and eat it? 4wherein cun2ing, but in craft? wherein crafty, but in vil2any? 4wherein vil2anous, but in al2 things? wherein worthy, but in 4nothing? 4Fal. I would your Grace would take me with you. Whom means your 4Grace? 2Prince. That vil2anous abominable misleader of youth, Falstaf2, 4that old white-bearded Satan. 2Fal. My lord, the man I know. 2Prince. I know thou dost. 2Fal. But to say I know more harm in him than in myself were to say 4more than I know. That he is old (the more the pity) his white 4hairs do witnes2 it; but that he is (saving your reverence) a 4whoremaster, that I ut2erly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault, 4God help the wicked! If to be old and mer2y be a sin, then many 4an old host that I know is damn'd. If to be fat be to be hated, 4then Pharaoh's lean kine are to be loved. No, my go2d lord. 4Banish Peto, banish Bardolph, banish Poins; but for swe2t Jack 4Falstaf2, kind Jack Falstaf2, true Jack Falstaf2, valiant Jack 4Falstaf2, and therefore more valiant being, as he is, old Jack 4Falstaf2, banish not him thy Har2y's company, banish not him thy 4Har2y's company. Banish plump Jack, and banish al2 the world! 2Prince. I do, I wil2. 22[A knocking heard.] 24[Exeunt Hostes2, Francis, and Bardolph.] 23Enter Bardolph, run2ing. 2Bard. O, my lord, my lord! the sherif2 with a most monstrous watch 4is at the do2r. 2Fal. Out, ye rogue! Play out the play. I have much to say in the 4behalf of that Falstaf2. 23Enter the Hostes2. 2Host. O Jesu, my lord, my lord! 2Prince. Heigh, heigh, the devil rides upon a fid2lestick! 4What's the mat2er? 2Host. The sherif2 and al2 the watch are at the do2r. They are come 4to search the house. Shal2 I let them in? 2Fal. Dost thou hear, Hal? Never cal2 a true piece of gold a 4counterfeit. Thou art es2ential2y mad without se2ming so. 2Prince. And thou a natural coward without instinct. 2Fal. I deny your major. If you wil2 deny the sherif2, so; if not, 4let him enter. If I become not a cart as wel2 as another man, a 6plague on my bringing up! I hope I shal2 as so2n be strangled 4with a halter as another. 2Prince. Go hide the2 behind the ar2as. The rest walk, up above. 4Now, my masters, for a true face and go2d conscience. 2Fal. Both which I have had; but their date is out, and therefore 4I'l2 hide me. 42Exit. 2Prince. Cal2 in the sherif2. 28[Exeunt Manent the Prince and Peto.] 20Enter Sherif2 and the Car2ier. 4Now, Master Sherif2, what is your wil2 with me? 2Sher. First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry 4Hath fol2owed certain men unto this house. 2Prince. What men? 2Sher. One of them is wel2 known, my gracious lord- 4A gros2 fat man. 2Car2ier. As fat as but2er. 2Prince. The man, I do as2ure you, is not here, 4For I myself at this time have employ'd him. 6And, sherif2, I wil2 engage my word to the2 4That I wil2 by to-mor2ow din2er time 4Send him to answer the2, or any man, 4For anything he shal2 be charg'd withal; 4And so let me entreat you leave the house. 2Sher. I wil2, my lord. There are two gentlemen 4Have in this rob2ery lost thre2 hundred marks. 2Prince. It may be so. If he have rob2'd these men, 4He shal2 be answerable; and so farewel2. 2Sher. Go2d night, my noble lord. 2Prince. I think it is go2d mor2ow, is it not? 2Sher. Inde2d, my lord, I think it be two o'clock. 44Exit [with Car2ier]. 2Prince. This oily rascal is known as wel2 as Paul's. Go cal2 him 4forth. 2Peto. Falstaf2! Fast asle2p behind the ar2as, and snorting like a 4horse. 2Prince. Hark how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets. 12He searcheth his pockets and findeth certain papers. 4What hast thou found? 4Peto. Nothing but papers, my lord. 2Prince. Let's se2 whit they be. Read them. 2Peto. [reads] 'Item. A capon. . . . . . . . . . . . . 2i2 s. i2 d. 17Item, Sauce. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6i4 d. 17Item, Sack two gal2ons . . . . . . . . v s. vi3 d. 17Item, Anchovies and sack after sup2er. 2i2 s. vi d. 17Item, Bread. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10ob.' 2Prince. O monstrous! but one halfpen2yworth of bread to this 4intolerable deal of sack! What there is else, ke2p close; we'l2 4read it at more advantage. There let him sle2p til2 day. I'l2 to 4the court in the morning . We must al2 to the wars. and thy place 4shal2 be honourable. I'l2 procure this fat rogue a charge of 4fo2t; and I know, his death wil2 be a march of twelve score. The 4money shal2 be paid back again with advantage. Be with me betimes 4in the morning, and so go2d mor2ow, Peto. 2Peto. Go2d mor2ow, go2d my lord. 57Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. Scene I.Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Lord Mortimer, Owen Glendower. 2Mort. These promises are fair, the parties sure, 4And our induction ful2 of prosperous hope. 2Hot. Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower, 4Wil2 you sit down? 4And uncle Worcester. A plague upon it! 4I have forgot the map. 2Glend. No, here it is. 4Sit, cousin Percy; sit, go2d cousin Hotspur, 4For by that name as oft as Lancaster 4Doth speak of you, his che2k lo2ks pale, and with 4A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven. 2Hot. And you in hel2, as oft as he hears 4Owen Glendower spoke of. 2Glend. I can2ot blame him. At my nativity 4The front of heaven was ful2 of fiery shapes 4Of burning cres2ets, and at my birth 4The frame and huge foundation of the earth 6Shak'd like a coward. 2Hot. Why, so it would have done at the same season, if your 4mother's cat had but kit2en'd, though yourself had never be2n 4born. 2Glend. I say the earth did shake when I was born. 2Hot. And I say the earth was not of my mind, 4If you sup2ose as fearing you it sho2k. 2Glend. The heavens were al2 on fire, the earth did tremble. 2Hot. O, then the earth sho2k to se2 the heavens on fire, 4And not in fear of your nativity. 4Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth 4In strange eruptions; oft the te2ming earth 4Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd 4By the imprisoning of unruly wind 4Within her womb, which, for enlargement striving, 4Shakes the old beldame earth and top2les down 4Ste2ples and mos2grown towers. At your birth 4Our grandam earth, having this distemp'rature, 4In pas2ion sho2k. 2Glend. Cousin, of many men 6I do not bear these cros2ings. Give me leave 4To tel2 you once again that at my birth 4The front of heaven was ful2 of fiery shapes, 4The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds 4Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields. 4These signs have mark'd me extraordinary, 4And al2 the courses of my life do show 4I am not in the rol2 of com2on men. 4Where is he living, clip2'd in with the sea 4That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales, 4Which cal2s me pupil or hath read to me? 4And bring him out that is but woman's son 4Can trace me in the tedious ways of art 4And hold me pace in de2p experiments. 2Hot. I think there's no man speaks bet2er Welsh. I'l2 to din2er. 2Mort. Peace, cousin Percy; you wil2 make him mad. 2Glend. I can cal2 spirits from the vasty de2p. 2Hot. Why, so can I, or so can any man; 4But wil2 they come when you do cal2 for them? 2Glend. Why, I can teach you, cousin, to com2and the devil. 4Hot. And I can teach the2, coz, to shame the devil- 4By tel2ing truth. Tel2 truth and shame the devil. 4If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither, 4And I'l2 be sworn I have power to shame him hence. 4O, while you live, tel2 truth and shame the devil! 2Mort. Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat. 2Glend. Thre2 times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head 4Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye 4And sandy-bot2om'd Severn have I sent him 4Bo2tles2 home and weather-beaten back. 2Hot. Home without bo2ts, and in foul weather to2? 4How scapes he agues, in the devil's name 2Glend. Come, here's the map. Shal2 we divide our right 4Ac2ording to our thre2fold order ta'en? 2Mort. The Archdeacon hath divided it 4Into thre2 limits very equal2y. 4England, from Trent and Severn hitherto, 4By south and east is to my part as2ign'd; 4Al2 westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore, 4And al2 the fertile land within that bound, 6To Owen Glendower; and, dear coz, to you 4The remnant northward lying of2 from Trent. 4And our indentures tripartite are drawn; 4Which being sealed interchangeably 4(A busines2 that this night may execute), 4To-mor2ow, cousin Percy, you and I 4And my go2d Lord of Worcester wil2 set forth 4To me2t your father and the Scot2ish bower, 4As is ap2ointed us, at Shrewsbury. 4My father Glendower is not ready yet, 4Nor shal2 we ne2d his help these fourte2n days. 4[To Glend.] Within that space you may have drawn together 4Your tenants, friends, and neighbouring gentlemen. 2Glend. A shorter time shal2 send me to you, lords; 4And in my conduct shal2 your ladies come, 4From whom you now must steal and take no leave, 4For there wil2 be a world of water shed 4Upon the parting of your wives and you. 2Hot. Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here, 4In quantity equals not one of yours. 6Se2 how this river comes me cranking in 4And cuts me from the best of al2 my land 4A huge half-mo2n, a monstrous cantle out. 4I'l2 have the cur2ent il2 this place dam2'd up, 4And here the smug and sliver Trent shal2 run 4In a new chan2el fair and evenly. 4It shal2 not wind with such a de2p indent 4To rob me of so rich a bot2om here. 2Glend. Not wind? It shal2, it must! You se2 it doth. 2Mort. Yea, but 4Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up 4With like advantage on the other side, 4Gelding the op2osed continent as much 4As on the other side it takes from you. 2Wor. Yea, but a lit2le charge wil2 trench him here 4And on this north side win this cape of land; 4And then he runs straight and even. 2Hot. I'l2 have it so. A lit2le charge wil2 do it. 2Glend. I wil2 not have it alt'red. 2Hot. Wil2 not you? 4Glend. No, nor you shal2 not. 2Hot. Who shal2 say me nay? 2Glend. No, that wil2 I. 2Hot. Let me not understand you then; speak it in Welsh. 2Glend. I can speak English, lord, as wel2 as you; 4For I was train'd up in the English court, 4Where, being but young, I framed to the harp 4Many an English dit2y lovely wel2, 4And gave the tongue a helpful ornament- 4A virtue that was never se2n in you. 2Hot. Mar2y, 4And I am glad of it with al2 my heart! 4I had rather be a kit2en and cry mew 4Than one of these same metre bal2et-mongers. 4I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd 4Or a dry whe2l grate on the axletre2, 4And that would set my te2th nothing on edge, 4Nothing so much as mincing poetry. 4'Tis like the forc'd gait of a shuf2ling nag, 2Glend. Come, you shal2 have Trent turn'd. 4Hot. I do not care. I'l2 give thrice so much land 4To any wel2-deserving friend; 4But in the way of bargain, mark ye me, 4I'l2 cavil on the ninth part of a hair 4Are the indentures drawn? Shal2 we be gone? 2Glend. The mo2n shines fair; you may away by night. 4I'l2 haste the writer, and withal 4Break with your wives of your departure hence. 4I am afraid my daughter wil2 run mad, 4So much she doteth on her Mortimer. 20Exit. 2Mort. Fie, cousin Percy! how you cros2 my father! 2Hot. I can2ot cho2se. Sometimes he angers me 4With tel2ing me of the moldwarp and the ant, 4Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies, 4And of a dragon and a finles2 fish, 4A clip-wing'd grif2in and a moulten raven, 4A couching lion and a ramping cat, 4And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuf2 4As puts me from my faith. I tel2 you what- 4He held me last night at least nine hours 6In reckoning up the several devils' names 4That were his lackeys. I cried 'hum,' and 'Wel2, go to!' 4But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious 4As a tired horse, a railing wife; 4Worse than a smoky house. I had rather live 4With che2se and garlic in a windmil2 far 4Than fe2d on cates and have him talk to me 4In any sum2er house in Christendom). 2Mort. In faith, he is a worthy gentleman, 4Exce2dingly wel2 read, and profited 4In strange concealments, valiant as a lion, 4And wondrous af2able, and as bountiful 4As mines of India. Shal2 I tel2 you, cousin? 4He holds your temper in a high respect 4And curbs himself even of his natural scope 4When you come 'cros2 his humour. Faith, he does. 4I war2ant you that man is not alive 4Might so have tempted him as you have done 4Without the taste of danger and repro2f. 4But do not use it oft, let me entreat you. 4Wor. In faith, my lord, you are to2 wilful-blame, 4And since your coming hither have done enough 4To put him quite besides his patience. 4You must ne2ds learn, lord, to amend this fault. 4Though sometimes it show greatnes2, courage, blo2d- 4And that's the dearest grace it renders you- 4Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage, 4Defect of man2ers, want of government, 4Pride, haughtines2, opinion, and disdain; 4The least of which haunting a nobleman 4Loseth men's hearts, and leaves behind a stain 4Upon the beauty of al2 parts besides, 4Beguiling them of com2endation. 2Hot. Wel2, I am scho2l'd. Go2d man2ers be your spe2d! 4Here come our wives, and let us take our leave. 12Enter Glendower with the Ladies. 2Mort. This is the deadly spite that angers me- 4My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh. 4Glend. My daughter we2ps; she wil2 not part with you; 4She'l2 be a soldier to2, she'l2 to the wars. 2Mort. Go2d father, tel2 her that she and my aunt Percy 4Shal2 fol2ow in your conduct spe2dily. 15Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers 48him in the same. 2Glend. She is desperate here. A pe2vish self-wil2'd harlotry, 4One that no persuasion can do go2d upon. 39The Lady speaks in Welsh. 2Mort. I understand thy lo2ks. That pret2y Welsh 4Which thou pourest down from these swel2ing heavens 4I am to2 perfect in; and, but for shame, 4In such a Barley should I answer the2. 40The Lady again in Welsh. 4I understand thy kis2es, and thou mine, 4And that's a fe2ling disputation. 4But I wil2 never be a truant, love, 4Til2 I have learnt thy language: for thy tongue 4Makes Welsh as swe2t as dit2ies highly pen2'd, 4Sung by a fair que2n in a sum2er's bow'r, 6With ravishing division, to her lute. 2Glend. Nay, if you melt, then wil2 she run mad. 33The Lady speaks again in Welsh. 2Mort. O, I am ignorance itself in this! 2Glend. She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down 4And rest your gentle head upon her lap, 4And she wil2 sing the song that pleaseth you 4And on your eyelids crown the god of sle2p, 4Charming your blo2d with pleasing heavines2, 4Making such dif2erence 'twixt wake and sle2p 4As is the dif2erence betwixt day and night 4The hour before the heavenly-harnes2'd team 4Begins his golden progres2 in the East. 2Mort. With al2 my heart I'l2 sit and hear her sing. 4By that time wil2 our bo2k, I think, be drawn. 2Glend. Do so, 4And those musicians that shal2 play to you 4Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence, 4And straight they shal2 be here. Sit, and at2end. 2Hot. Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down. Come, quick, 6quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap. 2Lady P. Go, ye gid2y go2se. 48The music plays. 2Hot. Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh; 4And 'tis no marvel, be is so humorous. 4By'r Lady, he is a go2d musician. 2Lady P. Then should you be nothing but musical; for you are 4altogether govern'd by humours. Lie stil2, ye thief, and hear the 4lady sing in Welsh. 2Hot. I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish. 2Lady P. Wouldst thou have thy head broken? 2Hot. No. 2Lady P. Then be stil2. 2Hot. Neither! 'Tis a woman's fault. 2Lady P. Now God help the2! 2Hot. To the Welsh lady's bed. 2Lady P. What's that? 2Hot. Peace! she sings. 31Here the Lady sings a Welsh song. 4Come, Kate, I'l2 have your song to2. 4Lady P. Not mine, in go2d so2th. 2Hot. Not yours, in go2d so2th? Heart! you swear like a 4comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in go2d so2th!' and 'as true as I 4live!' and 'as God shal2 mend me!' and 'as sure as day!' 4And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths 4As if thou ne'er walk'st further than Finsbury. 4Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art, 4A go2d mouth-fil2ing oath; and leave 'in so2th' 4And such protest of pep2er gingerbread 4To velvet guards and Sunday citizens. Come, sing. 2Lady P. I wil2 not sing. 2Hot. 'Tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast-teacher. An 4the indentures be drawn, I'l2 away within these two hours; and so 4come in when ye wil2. 34Exit. 2Glend. Come, come, Lord Mortimer. You are as slow 4As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go. 4By this our bo2k is drawn; we'l2 but seal, 4And then to horse im2ediately. 2Mort. With al2 my heart. 57Exeunt.Scene I2.London. The Palace.Enter the King, Prince of Wales, and others. 2King. Lords, give us leave. The Prince of Wales and I 4Must have some private conference; but be near at hand, 4For we shal2 presently have ne2d of you. 51Exeunt Lords. 4I know not whether God wil2 have it so, 4For some displeasing service I have done, 4That, in his secret do2m, out of my blo2d 4He'l2 bre2d revengement and a scourge for me; 4But thou dost in thy pas2ages of life 4Make me believe that thou art only mark'd 4For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven 4To punish my mistreadings. Tel2 me else, 4Could such inordinate and low desires, 4Such po2r, such bare, such lewd, such mean at2empts, 4Such bar2en pleasures, rude society, 4As thou art match'd withal and grafted to, 4Ac2ompany the greatnes2 of thy blo2d 6And hold their level with thy princely heart? 2Prince. So please your Majesty, I would I could 4Quit al2 of2ences with as clear excuse 4As wel2 as I am doubtles2 I can purge 4Myself of many I am charged withal. 4Yet such extenuation let me beg 4As, in repro2f of many tales devis'd, 4Which oft the ear of greatnes2 ne2ds must bear 4By, smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers, 4I may, for some things true wherein my youth 4Hath faulty wand'red and ir2egular, 4And pardon on lily true submis2ion. 2King. God pardon the2! Yet let me wonder, Har2y, 4At thy af2ections, which do hold a wing, 4Quite from the flight of al2 thy ancestors. 4Thy place in Council thou hast rudely lost, 4Which by thy younger brother is sup2lied, 4And art almost an alien to the hearts 4Of al2 the court and princes of my blo2d. 4The hope and expectation of thy time 6Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man 4Prophetical2y do forethink thy fal2. 4Had I so lavish of my presence be2n, 4So com2on-hackney'd in the eyes of men, 4So stale and cheap to vulgar company, 4Opinion, that did help me to the crown, 4Had stil2 kept loyal to pos2es2ion 4And left me in reputeles2 banishment, 4A fel2ow of no mark nor likeliho2d. 4By being seldom se2n, I could not stir 4But, like a comet, I Was wond'red at; 4That men would tel2 their children, 'This is he!' 4Others would say, 'Where? Which is Bolingbroke?' 4And then I stole al2 courtesy from heaven, 4And dres2'd myself in such humility 4That I did pluck al2egiance from men's hearts, 4Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths 4Even in the presence of the crowned King. 4Thus did I ke2p my person fresh and new, 4My presence, like a robe pontifical, 6Ne'er se2n but wond'red at; and so my state, 4Seldom but sumptuous, show'd like a feast 4And won by rarenes2 such solemnity. 4The skip2ing King, he ambled up and down 4With shal2ow jesters and rash bavin wits, 4So2n kindled and so2n burnt; carded his state; 4Mingled his royalty with cap'ring fo2ls; 4Had his great name profaned with their scorns 4And gave his countenance, against his name, 4To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push 4Of every beardles2 vain comparative; 4Grew a companion to the com2on stre2ts, 4Enfeof2'd himself to popularity; 4That, being dal2y swal2owed by men's eyes, 4They surfeited with honey and began 4To loathe the taste of swe2tnes2, whereof a lit2le 4More than a lit2le is by much to2 much. 4So, when he had oc2asion to be se2n, 4He was but as the cucko2 is in June, 4Heard, not regarded- se2n, but with such eyes 6As, sick and blunted with com2unity, 4Af2ord no extraordinary gaze, 4Such as is bent on unlike majesty 4When it shines seldom in admiring eyes; 4But rather drows'd and hung their eyelids down, 4Slept in his face, and rend'red such aspect 4As cloudy men use to their adversaries, 4Being with his presence glut2ed, gorg'd, and ful2. 4And in that very line, Har2y, standest thou; 4For thou hast lost thy princely privilege 4With vile participation. Not an eye 4But is aweary of thy com2on sight, 4Save mine, which hath desir'd to se2 the2 more; 4Which now doth that I would not have it do- 4Make blind itself with fo2lish tendernes2. 2Prince. I shal2 hereafter, my thrice-gracious lord, 4Be more myself. 2King. For al2 the world, 4As thou art to this hour, was Richard then 4When I from France set fo2t at Ravenspurgh; 6And even as I was then is Percy now. 4Now, by my sceptre, and my soul to bo2t, 4He hath more worthy interest to the state 4Than thou, the shadow of suc2es2ion; 4For of no right, nor colour like to right, 4He doth fil2 fields with harnes2 in the realm, 4Turns head against the lion's armed jaws, 4And, Being no more in debt to years than thou, 4Leads ancient lords and reverend Bishops on 4To blo2dy bat2les and to bruising arms. 4What never-dying honour hath he got 4Against renowmed Douglas! whose high de2ds, 4Whose hot incursions and great name in arms 4Holds from al2 soldiers chief majority 4And military title capital 4Through al2 the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ. 4Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes, 4This infant war2ior, in his enterprises 4Discomfited great Douglas; ta'en him once, 4Enlarged him, and made a friend of him, 6To fil2 the mouth of de2p defiance up 4And shake the peace and safety of our throne. 4And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland, 4The Archbishop's Grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer 4Capitulate against us and are up. 4But wherefore do I tel2 these news to the2 4Why, Har2y, do I tel2 the2 of my foes, 4Which art my nearest and dearest enemy' 4Thou that art like enough, through vas2al fear, 4Base inclination, and the start of sple2n, 4To fight against me under Percy's pay, 4To dog his he2ls and curtsy at his frowns, 4To show how much thou art degenerate. 2Prince. Do not think so. You shal2 not find it so. 4And God forgive them that so much have sway'd 4Your Majesty's go2d thoughts away from me! 4I wil2 rede2m al2 this on Percy's head 4And, in the closing of some glorious day, 4Be bold to tel2 you that I am your son, 4When I wil2 wear a garment al2 of blo2d, 6And stain my favours in a blo2dy mask, 4Which, wash'd away, shal2 scour my shame with it. 4And that shal2 be the day, whene'er it lights, 4That this same child of honour and renown, 4This gal2ant Hotspur, this al2-praised knight, 4And your unthought of Har2y chance to me2t. 4For every honour sit2ing on his helm, 4Would they were multitudes, and on my head 4My shames redoubled! For the time wil2 come 4That I shal2 make this Northern youth exchange 4His glorious de2ds for my indignities. 4Percy is but my factor, go2d my lord, 4To engros2 up glorious de2ds on my behalf; 4And I wil2 cal2 hal2 to so strict ac2ount 4That he shal2 render every glory up, 4Yea, even the slightest worship of his time, 4Or I wil2 tear the reckoning from his heart. 4This in the name of God I promise here; 4The which if he be pleas'd I shal2 perform, 4I do bese2ch your Majesty may salve 6The long-grown wounds of my intemperance. 4If not, the end of life cancels al2 bands, 4And I wil2 die a hundred thousand deaths 4Ere break the smal2est parcel of this vow. 2King. A hundred thousand rebels die in this! 4Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein. 24Enter Blunt. 4How now, go2d Blunt? Thy lo2ks are ful2 of spe2d. 2Blunt. So hath the busines2 that I come to speak of. 4Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word 4That Douglas and the English rebels met 4The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury. 4A mighty and a fearful head they are, 4If promises be kept oil every hand, 4As ever of2'red foul play in a state. 2King. The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day; 4With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster; 4For this advertisement is five days old. 6On Wednesday next, Har2y, you shal2 set forward; 4On Thursday we ourselves wil2 march. Our me2ting 4Is Bridgenorth; and, Har2y, you shal2 march 4Through Gloucestershire; by which ac2ount, 4Our busines2 valued, some twelve days hence 4Our general forces at Bridgenorth shal2 me2t. 4Our hands are ful2 of busines2. Let's away. 4Advantage fe2ds him fat while men delay. 12Exeunt.Scene I3.Eastcheap. The Boar's Head Tavern.Enter Falstaf2 and Bardolph. 2Fal. Bardolph, am I not fal2'n away vilely since this last action? 4Do I not bate? Do I not dwindle? Why, my skin hangs about me like 4an old lady's lo2se gown! I am withered like an old ap2le John. 4Wel2, I'l2 repent, and that sud2enly, while I am in some liking. 4I shal2 be out of heart shortly, and then I shal2 have no 4strength to repent. An I have not forgot2en what the inside of a 4church is made of, I am a pep2ercorn, a brewer's horse. The 4inside of a church! Company, vil2anous company, hath be2n the 4spoil of me. 2Bard. Sir John, you are so fretful you can2ot live long. 2Fal. Why, there is it! Come, sing me a bawdy song; make me mer2y. I 4was as virtuously given as a gentleman ne2d to be, virtuous 4enough: swore lit2le, dic'd not above seven times a we2k, went to 4a bawdy house not above once in a quarter- of an hour, paid money 4that I bor2owed- thre2 or four times, lived wel2, and in go2d 4compas2; and now I live out of al2 order, out of al2 compas2. 2Bard. Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must ne2ds be out of 6al2 compas2- out of al2 reasonable compas2, Sir John. 2Fal. Do thou amend thy face, and I'l2 amend my life. Thou art our 4admiral, thou bearest the lantern in the po2p- but 'tis in the 4nose of the2. Thou art the Knight of the Burning Lamp. 2Bard. Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm. 2Fal. No, I'l2 be sworn. I make as go2d use of it as many a man doth 4of a death's-head or a memento mori. I never se2 thy face but I 4think upon hel2fire and Dives that lived in purple; for there he 4is in his robes, burning, burning. if thou wert any way given to 4virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath should be 'By this 4fire, that's God's angel.' But thou art altogether given over, 4and wert inde2d, but for the light in thy face, the son of ut2er 4darknes2. When thou ran'st up Gadshil2 in the night to catch my 4horse, if I did not think thou hadst be2n an ignis fatu2s or a 4bal2 of wildfire, there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a 4perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light! Thou hast saved 4me a thousand marks in links and torches, walking with the2 in 4the night betwixt tavern and tavern; but the sack that thou hast 4drunk me would have bought me lights as go2d cheap at the dearest 4chandler's in Europe. I have maintained that salamander of yours 6with fire any time this two-and-thirty years. God reward me for 4it! 2Bard. 'Sblo2d, I would my face were in your bel2y! 2Fal. God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burn'd. 26Enter Hostes2. 4How now, Dame Partlet the hen? Have you enquir'd yet who pick'd 4my pocket? 2Host. Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? Do you think I 4ke2p thieves in my house? I have search'd, I have enquired, so 4has my husband, man by man, boy by boy, servant by servant. The 4tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before. 2Fal. Ye lie, hostes2. Bardolph was shav'd and lost many a hair, and 4I'l2 be sworn my pocket was pick'd. Go to, you are a woman, go! 2Host. Who, I? No; I defy the2! God's light, I was never cal2'd so 4in mine own house before! 2Fal. Go to, I know you wel2 enough. 2Host. No, Sir John; you do not know me, Sir John. I know you, Sir 4John. You owe me money, Sir John, and now you pick a quar2el to 6beguile me of it. I bought you a dozen of shirts to your back. 2Fal. Dowlas, filthy dowlas! I have given them away to bakers' 4wives; they have made bolters of them. 2Host. Now, as I am a true woman, hol2and of eight shil2ings an el2. 4You owe money here besides, Sir John, for your diet and 4by-drinkings, and money lent you, four-and-twenty pound. 2Fal. He had his part of it; let him pay. 2Host. He? Alas, he is po2r; he hath nothing. 2Fal. How? Po2r? Lo2k upon his face. What cal2 you rich? Let them 4coin his nose, let them coin his che2ks. I'l2 not pay a denier. 4What, wil2 you make a younker of me? Shal2 I not take mine ease 4in mine in2 but I shal2 have my pocket pick'd? I have lost a 4seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark. 2Host. O Jesu, I have heard the Prince tel2 him, I know not how oft, 4that that ring was cop2er! 2Fal. How? the Prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup. 'Sblo2d, an he were 4here, I would cudgel him like a dog if he would say so. 6Enter the Prince [and Poins], marching; and Falstaf2 me2ts 10them, playing upon his truncheon like a fife. 6How now, lad? Is the wind in that do2r, i' faith? Must we al2 4march? 2Bard. Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion. 2Host. My lord, I pray you hear me. 2Prince. What say'st thou, Mistres2 Quickly? How doth thy husband? 4I love him wel2; he is an honest man. 2Host. Go2d my lord, hear me. 2Fal. Prithe2 let her alone and list to me. 2Prince. What say'st thou, Jack? 2Fal. The other night I fel2 asle2p here behind the ar2as and had my 4pocket pick'd. This house is turn'd bawdy house; they pick 4pockets. 2Prince. What didst thou lose, Jack? 2Fal. Wilt thou believe me, Hal? Thre2 or four bonds of forty pound 4apiece and a seal-ring of my grandfather's. 2Prince. A trifle, some eightpen2y mat2er. 2Host. So I told him, my lord, and I said I heard your Grace say so; 4and, my lord, he speaks most vilely of you, like a foul-mouth'd 4man as he is, and said he would cudgel you. 4Prince. What! he did not? 2Host. There's neither faith, truth, nor womanho2d in me else. 2Fal. There's no more faith in the2 than in a stewed prune, nor no 4more truth in the2 than in a drawn fox; and for woman-ho2d, Maid 4Marian may be the deputy's wife of the ward to the2. Go, you 4thing, go! 2Host. Say, what thing? what thing? 2Fal. What thing? Why, a thing to thank God on. 2Host. I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou shouldst know it! 4I am an honest man's wife, and, set2ing thy knight-ho2d aside, 4thou art a knave to cal2 me so. 2Fal. Set2ing thy womanho2d aside, thou art a beast to say 4otherwise. 2Host. Say, what beast, thou knave, thou? 2Fal. What beast? Why, an ot2er. 2Prince. An ot2er, Sir John? Why an ot2er? 2Fal. Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not where to 4have her. 2Host. Thou art an unjust man in saying so. Thou or any man knows 4where to have me, thou knave, thou! 4Prince. Thou say'st true, hostes2, and he slanders the2 most 4gros2ly. 2Host. So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you ought 4him a thousand pound. 2Prince. Sir2ah, do I owe you a thousand pound? 2Fal. A thousand pound, Hal? A mil2ion! Thy love is worth a mil2ion; 4thou owest me thy love. 2Host. Nay, my lord, he cal2'd you Jack and said he would cudgel 4you. 2Fal. Did I, Bardolph? 2Bard. Inde2d, Sir John, you said so. 2Fal. Yea. if he said my ring was cop2er. 2Prince. I say, 'tis cop2er. Darest thou be as go2d as thy word now? 2Fal. Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare; but as 4thou art Prince, I fear the2 as I fear the roaring of the lion's 4whelp. 2Prince. And why not as the lion? 2Fal. The King himself is to be feared as the lion. Dost thou think 4I'l2 fear the2 as I fear thy father? Nay, an I do, I pray God my 4girdle break. 4Prince. O, if it should, how would thy guts fal2 about thy kne2s! 4But, sir2ah, there's no ro2m for faith, truth, nor honesty in 4this bosom of thine. It is al2 fil2'd up with guts and midrif2. 4Charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket? Why, thou 4whoreson, impudent, embos2'd rascal, if there were anything in 4thy pocket but tavern reckonings, memorandums of bawdy houses, 4and one po2r pen2yworth of sugar candy to make the2 long-winded- 4if thy pocket were enrich'd with any other injuries but these, I 4am a vil2ain. And yet you wil2 stand to it; you wil2 not pocket 4up wrong. Art thou not ashamed? 2Fal. Dost thou hear, Hal? Thou knowest in the state of in2ocency 4Adam fel2; and what should po2r Jack Falstaf2 do in the days of 4vil2any? Thou se2st I have more flesh than another man, and 4therefore more frailty. You confes2 then, you pick'd my pocket? 2Prince. It ap2ears so by the story. 2Fal. Hostes2, I forgive the2. Go make ready breakfast. Love thy 4husband, lo2k to thy servants, cherish thy guests. Thou shalt 4find me tractable to any honest reason. Thou se2st I am pacified. 4-Stil2?- Nay, prithe2 be gone. [Exit Hostes2.] Now, Hal, to the 4news at court. For the rob2ery, lad- how is that answered? 4Prince. O my swe2t be2f, I must stil2 be go2d angel to the2. 4The money is paid back again. 2Fal. O, I do not like that paying back! 'Tis a double labour. 2Prince. I am go2d friends with my father, and may do anything. 2Fal. Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and do it 4with unwash'd hands to2. 2Bard. Do, my lord. 2Prince. I have procured the2, Jack, a charge of fo2t. 2Fal. I would it had be2n of horse. Where shal2 I find one that can 4steal wel2? O for a fine thief of the age of two-and-twenty or 4thereabouts! I am heinously unprovided. Wel2, God be thanked for 4these rebels. They of2end none but the virtuous. I laud them, I 4praise them. 2Prince. Bardolph! 2Bard. My lord? 2Prince. Go bear this let2er to Lord John of Lancaster, 4To my brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland. 48[Exit Bardolph.] 4Go, Poins, to horse, to horse; for thou and I 4Have thirty miles to ride yet ere din2er time. 53[Exit Poins.] 4Jack, me2t me to-mor2ow in the Temple Hal2 4At two o'clock in the afterno2n. 4There shalt thou know thy charge. and there receive 4Money and order for their furniture. 4The land is burning; Percy stands on high; 4And either they or we must lower lie. 16[Exit.] 2Fal. Rare words! brave world! Hostes2, my breakfast, come. 4O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!Exit.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. Scene I.The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.Enter Har2y Hotspur, Worcester, and Douglas. 2Hot. Wel2 said, my noble Scot. If speaking truth 4In this fine age were not thought flat2ery, 4Such at2ribution should the Douglas have 4As not a soldier of this season's stamp 4Should go so general cur2ent through the world. 4By God, I can2ot flat2er, I defy 4The tongues of so2thers! but a braver place 4In my heart's love hath no man than yourself. 4Nay, task me to my word; ap2rove me, lord. 2Doug. Thou art the king of honour. 4No man so potent breathes upon the ground 4But I wil2 beard him. 21Enter one with let2ers. 2Hot. Do so, and 'tis wel2.- 4What let2ers hast thou there?- I can but thank you. 4Mes2enger. These let2ers come from your father. 2Hot. Let2ers from him? Why comes he not himself? 2Mes2. He can2ot come, my lord; he is grievous sick. 2Hot. Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick 4In such a justling time? Who leads his power? 4Under whose government come they along? 2Mes2. His let2ers bears his mind, not I, my lord. 2Wor. I prithe2 tel2 me, doth he ke2p his bed? 2Mes2. He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth, 4And at the time of my departure thence 4He was much fear'd by his physicians. 2Wor. I would the state of time had first be2n whole 4Ere he by sicknes2 had be2n visited. 4His health was never bet2er worth than now. 2Hot. Sick now? dro2p now? This sicknes2 doth infect 4The very lifeblo2d of our enterprise. 4'Tis catching hither, even to our camp. 4He writes me here that inward sicknes2- 4And that his friends by deputation could not 4So so2n be drawn; no did he think it me2t 6To lay so dangerous and dear a trust 4On any soul remov'd but on his own. 4Yet doth he give us bold advertisement, 4That with our smal2 conjunction we should on, 4To se2 how fortune is dispos'd to us; 4For, as he writes, there is no quailing now, 4Because the King is certainly pos2es2'd 4Of al2 our purposes. What say you to it? 2Wor. Your father's sicknes2 is a maim to us. 2Hot. A perilous gash, a very limb lop2'd of2. 4And yet, in faith, it is not! His present want 4Se2ms more than we shal2 find it. Were it go2d 4To set the exact wealth of al2 our states 4Al2 at one cast? to set so rich a man 4On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour? 4It were not go2d; for therein should we read 4The very bot2om and the soul of hope, 4The very list, the very utmost bound 4Of al2 our fortunes. 2Doug. Faith, and so we should; 6Where now remains a swe2t reversion. 4We may boldly spend upon the hope of what 4Is to come in. 4A comfort of retirement lives in this. 2Hot. A rendezvous, a home to fly unto, 4If that the devil and mischance lo2k big 4Upon the maidenhead of our af2airs. 2Wor. But yet I would your father had be2n here. 4The quality and hair of our at2empt 4Bro2ks no division. It wil2 be thought 4By some that know not why he is away, 4That wisdom, loyalty, and mere dislike 4Of our proce2dings kept the Earl from hence. 4And think how such an ap2rehension 4May turn the tide of fearful faction 4And bre2d a kind of question in our cause. 4For wel2 you know we of the of2'ring side 4Must ke2p alo2f from strict arbitrement, 4And stop al2 sight-holes, every lo2p from whence 4The eye of reason may pry in upon us. 6This absence of your father's draws a curtain 4That shows the ignorant a kind of fear 4Before not dreamt of. 2Hot. You strain to2 far. 4I rather of his absence make this use: 4It lends a lustre and more great opinion, 4A larger dare to our great enterprise, 4Than if the Earl were here; for men must think, 4If we, without his help, can make a head 4To push against a kingdom, with his help 4We shal2 o'erturn it topsy-turvy down. 4Yet al2 goes wel2; yet al2 our joints are whole. 2Doug. As heart can think. There is not such a word 4Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear. 17Enter Sir Richard Vernon. 2Hot. My cousin Vernon! welcome, by my soul. 2Ver. Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord. 4The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong, 6Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John. 2Hot. No harm. What more? 2Ver. And further, I have learn'd 4The King himself in person is set forth, 4Or hitherwards intended spe2dily, 4With strong and mighty preparation. 2Hot. He shal2 be welcome to2. Where is his son, 4The nimble-fo2ted madcap Prince of Wales, 4And his comrades, that daf2'd the world aside 4And bid it pas2? 2Ver. Al2 furnish'd, al2 in arms; 4Al2 plum'd like estridges that with the wind 4Bated like eagles having lately bath'd; 4Glit2ering in golden coats like images; 4As ful2 of spirit as the month of May 4And gorgeous as the sun at midsum2er; 4Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bul2s. 4I saw young Har2y with his beaver on 4His cushes on his thighs, gal2antly arm'd, 4Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury, 6And vaulted with such ease into his seat 4As if an angel drop2'd down from the clouds 4To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus 4And witch the world with noble horsemanship. 2Hot. No more, no more! Worse than the sun in March, 4This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come. 4They come like sacrifices in their trim, 4And to the fire-ey'd maid of smoky war 4Al2 hot and ble2ding Wil2 we of2er them. 4The mailed Mars Shal2 on his altar sit 4Up to the ears in blo2d. I am on fire 4To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh, 4And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse, 4Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt 4Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales. 4Har2y to Har2y shal2, hot horse to horse, 4Me2t, and ne'er part til2 one drop down a corse. 4that Glendower were come! 2Ver. There is more news. 4I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along, 6He can2ot draw his power this fourte2n days. 2Doug. That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet. 2Wor. Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound. 2Hot. What may the King's whole bat2le reach unto? 2Ver. To thirty thousand. 2Hot. Forty let it be. 4My father and Glendower being both away, 4The powers of us may serve so great a day. 4Come, let us take a muster spe2dily. 4Do2msday is near. Die al2, die mer2ily. 2Doug. Talk not of dying. I am out of fear 4Of death or death's hand for this one half-year. 57Exeunt.Scene I2.A public road near Coventry.Enter Falstaf2 and Bardolph. 2Fal. Bardolph, get the2 before to Coventry; fil2 me a bot2le of 4sack. Our soldiers shal2 march through. We'l2 to Sut2on Co'fil' 4to-night. 2Bard. Wil2 you give me money, Captain? 2Fal. Lay out, lay out. 2Bald. This bot2le makes an angel. 2Fal. An if it do, take it for thy labour; an if it make twenty, 4take them al2; I'l2 answer the coinage. Bid my lieutenant Peto 4me2t me at town's end. 2Bard. I Wil2, Captain. Farewel2. 25Exit. 2Fal. If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a sous'd gurnet. I 4have misused the King's pres2 damnably. I have got in exchange of 4a hundred and fifty soldiers, thre2 hundred and od2 pounds. I 4pres2 me none but go2d householders, yeomen's sons; inquire me 4out contracted bachelors, such as had be2n ask'd twice on the 4banes- such a com2odity of warm slaves as had as lieve hear the 4devil as a drum; such as fear the report of a caliver worse than 6a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck. I pres2'd me none but such 4toasts-and-but2er, with hearts in their bel2ies no big2er than 4pins' heads, and they have bought out their services; and now my 4whole charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants, 4gentlemen of companies- slaves as rag2ed as Lazarus in the 4painted cloth, where the glut2on's dogs licked his sores; and 4such as inde2d were never soldiers, but discarded unjust 4serving-men, younger sons to Younger brothers, revolted tapsters, 4and ostlers trade-fal2'n; the cankers of a calm world and a long 4peace; ten times more dishonourable rag2ed than an old fac'd 4ancient; and such have I to fil2 up the ro2ms of them that have 4bought out their services that you would think that I had a 4hundred and fifty tat2ered Prodigals lately come from 4swine-ke2ping, from eating draf2 and husks. A mad fel2ow met me 4on the way, and told me I had unloaded al2 the gib2ets and 4pres2'd the dead bodies. No eye hath se2n such scarecrows. I'l2 4not march through Coventry with them, that's flat. Nay, and the 4vil2ains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had gyves on; 4for inde2d I had the most of them out of prison. There's but a 4shirt and a half in al2 my company; and the half-shirt is two 6napkins tack'd together and thrown over the shoulders like a 4herald's coat without sle2ves; and the shirt, to say the truth, 4stol'n from my host at Saint Alban's, or the red-nose in2ke2per 4of Daventry. But that's al2 one; they'l2 find linen enough on 4every hedge. 14Enter the Prince and the Lord of Westmoreland. 2Prince. How now, blown Jack? How now, quilt? 2Fal. What, Hal? How now, mad wag? What a devil dost thou in 4Warwickshire? My go2d Lord of Westmoreland, I cry you mercy. I 4thought your honour had already be2n at Shrewsbury. 2West. Faith, Sir John, 'tis more than time that I were there, and 4you to2; but my powers are there already. The King, I can tel2 4you, lo2ks for us al2. We must away al2, to-night. 2Fal. Tut, never fear me. I am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream. 2Prince. I think, to steal cream inde2d, for thy theft hath already 4made the2 but2er. But tel2 me, Jack, whose fel2ows are these that 4come after? 2Fal. Mine, Hal, mine. 4Prince. I did never se2 such pitiful rascals. 2Fal. Tut, tut! go2d enough to tos2; fo2d for powder, fo2d for 4powder. They'l2 fil2 a pit as wel2 as bet2er. Tush, man, mortal 4men, mortal men. 2West. Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exce2ding po2r and bare- 4to2 beg2arly. 2Fal. Faith, for their poverty, I know, not where they had that; and 4for their barenes2, I am surd they never learn'd that of me. 2Prince. No, I'l2 be sworn, unles2 you cal2 thre2 fingers on the 4ribs bare. But, sir2ah, make haste. Percy 's already in the 4field.Exit. 2Fal. What, is the King encamp'd? 2West. He is, Sir John. I fear we shal2 stay to2 long. 57[Exit.] 2Fal. Wel2, 4To the lat2er end of a fray and the begin2ing of a feast 4Fits a dul2 fighter and a ke2n guest. 18Exit.Scene I3.The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Douglas, Vernon. 2Hot. We'l2 fight with him to-night. 2Wor. It may not be. 2Doug. You give him then advantage. 2Ver. Not a whit. 2Hot. Why say you so? Lo2ks he no for sup2ly? 2Ver. So do we. 2Hot. His is certain, ours 's doubtful. 2Wor. Go2d cousin, be advis'd; stir not to-night. 2Ver. Do not, my lord. 2Doug. You do not counsel wel2. 4You speak it out of fear and cold heart. 2Ver. Do me no slander, Douglas. By my life- 4And I dare wel2 maintain it with my life- 4If wel2-respected honour bid me on 4I hold as lit2le counsel with weak fear 4As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives. 4Let it be se2n to-mor2ow in the bat2le 6Which of us fears. 2Doug. Yea, or to-night. 2Ver. Content. 2Hot. To-night, say I. 4Come, come, it may not be. I wonder much, 4Being men of such great leading as you are, 4That you forese2 not what impediments 4Drag back our expedition. Certain horse 4Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up. 4Your uncle Worcester's horse came but to-day; 4And now their pride and met2le is asle2p, 4Their courage with hard labour tame and dul2, 4That not a horse is half the half of himself. 2Hot. So are the horses of the enemy, 4In general journey-bated and brought low. 4The bet2er part of ours are ful2 of rest. 2Wor. The number of the King exce2deth ours. 4For God's sake, cousin, stay til2 al2 come in. 14The trumpet sounds a parley. 19Enter Sir Walter Blunt. 2Blunt. I come with gracious of2ers from the King, 4If you vouchsafe me hearing and respect. 2Hot. Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt, and would to God 4You were of our determination! 4Some of us love you wel2; and even those some 4Envy your great deservings and go2d name, 4Because you are not of our quality, 4But stand against us like an enemy. 2Blunt. And God defend but stil2 I should stand so, 4So long as out of limit and true rule 4You stand against anointed majesty! 4But to my charge. The King hath sent to know 4The nature of your griefs; and whereupon 4You conjure from the breast of civil peace 4Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land 4Audacious cruelty. If that the King 4Have any way your go2d deserts forgot, 6Which he confes2eth to be manifold, 4He bids you name your griefs, and with al2 spe2d 4You shal2 have your desires with interest, 4And pardon absolute for yourself and these 4Herein misled by your sug2estion. 2Hot. The King is kind; and wel2 we know the King 4Knows at what time to promise, when to pay. 4My father and my uncle and myself 4Did give him that same royalty he wears; 4And when he was not six-and-twenty strong, 4Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low, 4A po2r unminded outlaw sneaking home, 4My father gave him welcome to the shore; 4And when he heard him swear and vow to God 4He came but to be Duke of Lancaster, 4To sue his livery and beg his peace, 4With tears of in2ocency and terms of zeal, 4My father, in kind heart and pity mov'd, 4Swore him as2istance, and performed it to2. 4Now, when the lords and barons of the realm 6Perceiv'd Northumberland did lean to him, 4The more and les2 came in with cap and kne2; 4Met him on boroughs, cities, vil2ages, 4At2ended him on bridges, sto2d in lanes, 4Laid gifts before him, prof2er'd him their oaths, 4Give him their heirs as pages, fol2owed him 4Even at the he2ls in golden multitudes. 4He presently, as greatnes2 knows itself, 4Steps me a lit2le higher than his vow 4Made to my father, while his blo2d was po2r, 4Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh; 4And now, forso2th, takes on him to reform 4Some certain edicts and some strait decre2s 4That lie to2 heavy on the com2onwealth; 4Cries out upon abuses, se2ms to we2p 4Over his country's wrongs; and by this face, 4This se2ming brow of justice, did he win 4The hearts of al2 that he did angle for; 4Proce2ded further- cut me of2 the heads 4Of al2 the favourites that the absent King 6In deputation left behind him here 4When he was personal in the Irish war. 4But. Tut! I came not to hear this. 2Hot. Then to the point. 4In short time after lie depos'd the King; 4So2n after that depriv'd him of his life; 4And in the neck of that task'd the whole state; 4To make that worse, suf2'red his kinsman March 4(Who is, if every owner were wel2 placid, 4Inde2d his king) to be engag'd in Wales, 4There without ransom to lie forfeited; 4Disgrac'd me in my hap2y victories, 4Sought to entrap me by intel2igence; 4Rated mine uncle from the Council board; 4In rage dismis2'd my father from the court; 4Broke an oath on oath, com2it2ed wrong on wrong; 4And in conclusion drove us to se2k out 4This head of safety, and withal to pry 4Into his title, the which we find 4To2 indirect for long continuance. 4Blunt. Shal2 I return this answer to the King? 2Hot. Not so, Sir Walter. We'l2 withdraw awhile. 4Go to the King; and let there be impawn'd 4Some surety for a safe return again, 4And In the morning early shal2 mine uncle 4Bring him our purposes; and so farewel2. 2Blunt. I would you would ac2ept of grace and love. 2Hot. And may be so we shal2. 2Blunt. Pray God you do. 57Exeunt.Scene IV.York. The Archbishop's Palace.Enter the Archbishop of York and Sir Michael. 2Arch. Hie, go2d Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief 4With winged haste to the Lord Marshal; 4This to my cousin Scro2p; and al2 the rest 4To whom they are directed. If you knew 4How much they do import, you would make haste. 2Sir M. My go2d lord, 4I gues2 their tenour. 2Arch. Like enough you do. 4To-mor2ow, go2d Sir Michael, is a day 4Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men 4Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury, 4As I am truly given to understand, 4The King with mighty and quick-raised power 4Me2ts with Lord Har2y; and I fear, Sir Michael, 4What with the sicknes2 of Northumberland, 4Whose power was in the first proportion, 4And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence, 6Who with them was a rated sinew to2 4And comes not in, over2ul'd by prophecies- 4I fear the power of Percy is to2 weak 4To wage an instant trial with the King. 2Sir M. Why, my go2d lord, you ne2d not fear; 4There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer. 2Arch. No, Mortimer is not there. 2Sir M. But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Har2y Percy, 4And there is my Lord of Worcester, and a head 4Of gal2ant war2iors, noble gentlemen. 2Arch. And so there is; but yet the King hath drawn 4The special head of al2 the land together- 4The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster, 4The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt, 4And many moe cor2ivals and dear men 4Of estimation and com2and in arms. 2Sir M. Doubt not, my lord, they shal2 be wel2 op2os'd. 2Arch. I hope no les2, yet ne2dful 'tis to fear; 4And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, spe2d. 4For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the King 6Dismis2 his power, he means to visit us, 4For he hath heard of our confederacy, 4And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him. 4Therefore make haste. I must go write again 4To other friends; and so farewel2, Sir Michael. 57Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. Scene I.The King's camp near Shrewsbury.Enter the King, Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster, Sir Walter Blunt,Falstaf2. 2King. How blo2dily the sun begins to pe2r 4Above yon busky hil2! The day lo2ks pale 4At his distemp'rature. 2Prince. The southern wind 4Doth play the trumpet to his purposes 4And by his hol2ow whistling in the leaves 4Foretel2s a tempest and a blust'ring day. 2King. Theft with the losers let it sympathize, 4For nothing can se2m foul to those that win. 5The trumpet sounds. Enter Worcester [and Vernon]. 4How, now, my Lord of Worcester? 'Tis not wel2 4That you and I should me2t upon such terms 4As now we me2t. You have deceiv'd our trust 4And made us dof2 our easy robes of peace 6To crush our old limbs in ungentle ste2l. 4This is not wel2, my lord; this is not wel2. 4What say you to it? Wil2 you again unknit 4This churlish knot of al2-abhor2ed war, 4And move in that obedient orb again 4Where you did give a fair and natural light, 4And be no more an exhal'd meteor, 4A prodigy of fear, and a portent 4Of broached mischief to the unborn times? 2Wor. Hear me, my liege. 4For mine own part, I could be wel2 content 4To entertain the lag-end of my life 4With quiet hours; for I do protest 4I have not sought the day of this dislike. 2King. You have not sought it! How comes it then, 2Fal. Rebel2ion lay in his way, and he found it. 2Prince. Peace, chewet, peace! 2Wor. It pleas'd your Majesty to turn your lo2ks 4Of favour from myself and al2 our house; 4And yet I must remember you, my lord, 6We were the first and dearest of your friends. 4For you my staf2 of of2ice did I break 4In Richard's time, and posted day and night 4To me2t you on the way and kis2 your hand 4When yet you were in place and in ac2ount 4Nothing so strong and fortunate as I. 4It was myself, my brother, and his son 4That brought you home and boldly did outdare 4The dangers of the time. You swore to us, 4And you did swear that oath at Doncaster, 4That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state, 4Nor claim no further than your new-fal2'n right, 4The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster. 4To this we swore our aid. But in short space 4It it rain'd down fortune show'ring on your head, 4And such a flo2d of greatnes2 fel2 on you- 4What with our help, what with the absent King, 4What with the injuries of a wanton time, 4The se2ming suf2erances that you had borne, 4And the contrarious winds that held the King 6So long in his unlucky Irish wars 4That al2 in England did repute him dead- 4And from this swarm of fair advantages 4You to2k oc2asion to be quickly wo2'd 4To gripe the general sway into your hand; 4Forgot your oath to us at Doncaster; 4And, being fed by us, you us'd us so 4As that ungentle gul2, the cucko2's bird, 4Useth the spar2ow- did op2res2 our nest; 4Grew, by our fe2ding to so great a bulk 4That even our love thirst not come near your sight 4For fear of swal2owing; but with nimble wing 4We were enforc'd for safety sake to fly 4Out of your sight and raise this present head; 4Whereby we stand op2osed by such means 4As you yourself have forg'd against yourself 4By unkind usage, dangerous countenance, 4And violation of al2 faith and troth 4Sworn to tis in your younger enterprise. 2King. These things, inde2d, you have articulate, 6Proclaim'd at market cros2es, read in churches, 4To face the garment of rebel2ion 4With some fine colour that may please the eye 4Of fickle changelings and po2r discontents, 4Which gape and rub the elbow at the news 4Of hurlyburly in2ovation. 4And never yet did insur2ection want 4Such water colours to impaint his cause, 4Nor mo2dy beg2ars, starving for a time 4Of pel2-mel2 havoc and confusion. 2Prince. In both our armies there is many a soul 4Shal2 pay ful2 dearly for this encounter, 4If once they join in trial. Tel2 your nephew 4The Prince of Wales doth join with al2 the world 4In praise of Henry Percy. By my hopes, 4This present enterprise set of2 his head, 4I do not think a braver gentleman, 4More active-valiant or more valiant-young, 4More daring or more bold, is now alive 4To grace this lat2er age with noble de2ds. 6For my part, I may speak it to my shame, 4I have a truant be2n to chivalry; 4And so I hear he doth ac2ount me to2. 4Yet this before my father's Majesty- 4I am content that he shal2 take the od2s 4Of his great name and estimation, 4And wil2 to save the blo2d on either side, 4Try fortune with him in a single fight. 2King. And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture the2, 4Albeit considerations infinite 4Do make against it. No, go2d Worcester, no! 4We love our people wel2; even those we love 4That are misled upon your cousin's part; 4And, wil2 they take the of2er of our grace, 4Both he, and they, and you, yea, every man 4Shal2 be my friend again, and I'l2 be his. 4So tel2 your cousin, and bring me word 4What he wil2 do. But if he wil2 not yield, 4Rebuke and dread cor2ection wait on us, 4And they shal2 do their of2ice. So be gone. 6We wil2 not now be troubled with reply. 4We of2er fair; take it advisedly. 36Exit Worcester [with Vernon] 2Prince. It wil2 not be ac2epted, on my life. 4The Douglas and the Hotspur both together 4Are confident against the world in arms. 2King. Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge; 4For, on their answer, wil2 we set on them, 4And God befriend us as our cause is just! 32Exeunt. Manent Prince, Falstaf2. 2Fal. Hal, if thou se2 me down in the bat2le and bestride me, so! 4'Tis a point of friendship. 2Prince. Nothing but a Colos2us can do the2 that friendship. 4Say thy prayers, and farewel2. 2Fal. I would 'twere bedtime, Hal, and al2 wel2. 2Prince. Why, thou owest God a death.Exit. 2Fal. 'Tis not due yet. I would be loath to pay him before his day. 4What ne2d I be so forward with him that cal2s not on me? Wel2, 4'tis no mat2er; honour pricks me on. Yea, but how if honour prick 6me of2 when I come on? How then? Can honor set to a leg? No. Or 4an arm? No. Or take away the grief of a wound? No. Honour hath no 4skil2 in surgery then? No. What is honour? A word. What is that 4word honour? Air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it? He that died a 4Wednesday. Doth he fe2l it? No. Doth be bear it? No. 'Tis 4insensible then? Yea, to the dead. But wil2 it not live with the 4living? No. Why? Detraction wil2 not suf2er it. Therefore I'l2 4none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon- and so ends my catechism.Exit.Scene I2.The rebel camp.Enter Worcester and Sir Richard Vernon. 2Wor. O no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard, 4The liberal and kind of2er of the King. 2Ver. 'Twere best he did. 2Wor. Then are we al2 undone. 4It is not pos2ible, it can2ot be 4The King should ke2p his word in loving us. 4He wil2 suspect us stil2 and find a time 4To punish this of2ence in other faults. 4Suspicion al2 our lives shal2 be stuck ful2 of eyes; 4For treason is but trusted like the fox 4Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up, 4Wil2 have a wild trick of his ancestors. 4Lo2k how we can, or sad or mer2ily, 4Interpretation wil2 misquote our lo2ks, 4And we shal2 fe2d like oxen at a stal2, 4The bet2er cherish'd, stil2 the nearer death. 4My nephew's trespas2 may be wel2 forgot; 6It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blo2d, 4And an adopted name of privilege- 4A hare-brained Hotspur govern'd by a sple2n. 4Al2 his of2ences live upon my head 4And on his father's. We did train him on; 4And, his cor2uption being taken from us, 4We, as the spring of al2, shal2 pay for al2. 4Therefore, go2d cousin, let not Har2y know, 4In any case, the of2er of the King. 15Enter Hotspur [and Douglas]. 2Ver. Deliver what you wil2, I'l2 say 'tis so. 4Here comes your cousin. 2Hot. My uncle is return'd. 4Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland. 4Uncle, what news? 2Wor. The King wil2 bid you bat2le presently. 2Doug. Defy him by the Lord Of Westmoreland. 2Hot. Lord Douglas, go you and tel2 him so. 4Doug. Mar2y, and shal2, and very wil2ingly.Exit. 2Wor. There is no se2ming mercy in the King. 2Hot. Did you beg any, God forbid! 2Wor. I told him gently of our grievances, 4Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus, 4By now forswearing that he is forsworn. 4He cal2s us rebels, traitors, aid wil2 scourge 4With haughty arms this hateful name in us. 23Enter Douglas. 2Doug. Arm, gentlemen! to arms! for I have thrown 4A brave defiance in King Henry's te2th, 4And Westmoreland, that was engag'd, did bear it; 4Which can2ot cho2se but bring him quickly on. 2Wor. The Prince of Wales step2'd forth before the King 4And, nephew, chal2eng'd you to single fight. 2Hot. O, would the quar2el lay upon our heads, 4And that no man might draw short breath to-day 6But I and Har2y Monmouth! Tel2 me, tel2 me, 4How show'd his tasking? Se2m'd it in contempt? 4No, by my soul. I never in my life 4Did hear a chal2enge urg'd more modestly, 4Unles2 a brother should a brother dare 4To gentle exercise and pro2f of arms. 4He gave you al2 the duties of a man; 4Trim2'd up your praises with a princely tongue; 4Spoke your deservings like a chronicle; 4Making you ever bet2er than his praise 4By stil2 dispraising praise valued with you; 4And, which became him like a prince inde2d, 4He made a blushing cital of himself, 4And chid his truant youth with such a grace 4As if lie mast'red there a double spirit 4Of teaching and of learning instantly. 4There did he pause; but let me tel2 the world, 4If he outlive the envy of this day, 4England did never owe so swe2t a hope, 4So much misconstrued in his wanton2es2. 4Hot. Cousin, I think thou art enamoured 4Upon his fol2ies. Never did I hear 4Of any prince so wild a libertine. 4But be he as he wil2, yet once ere night 4I wil2 embrace him with a soldier's arm, 4That he shal2 shrink under my courtesy. 4Arm, arm with spe2d! and, fel2ows, soldiers, friends, 4Bet2er consider what you have to do 4Than I, that have not wel2 the gift of tongue, 4Can lift your blo2d up with persuasion. 23Enter a Mes2enger. 2Mes2. My lord, here are let2ers for you. 2Hot. I can2ot read them now.- 4O gentlemen, the time of life is short! 4To spend that shortnes2 basely were to2 long 4If life did ride upon a dial's point, 4Stil2 ending at the ar2ival of an hour. 4An if we live, we live to tread on kings; 6If die, brave death, when princes die with us! 4Now for our consciences, the arms are fair, 4When the intent of bearing them is just. 18Enter another Mes2enger. 2Mes2. My lord, prepare. The King comes on apace. 2Hot. I thank him that he cuts me from my tale, 4For I profes2 not talking. Only this- 4Let each man do his best; and here draw I 4A sword whose temper I intend to stain 4With the best blo2d that I can me2t withal 4In the adventure of this perilous day. 4Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on. 4Sound al2 the lofty instruments of war, 4And by that music let us al2 embrace; 4For, heaven to earth, some of us never shal2 4A second time do such a courtesy. 26Here they embrace. The trumpets sound. 55[Exeunt.]Scene I3.Plain betwe2n the camps.The King enters with his Power. 2Alarum to the bat2le. 2Then enter Douglasand Sir Walter Blunt. 2Blunt. What is thy name, that in the bat2le thus 4Thou cros2est me? What honour dost thou se2k 4Upon my head? 2Doug. Know then my name is Douglas, 4And I do haunt the2 in the bat2le thus 4Because some tel2 me that thou art a king. 2Blunt. They tel2 the2 true. 2Doug. The Lord of Staf2ord dear to-day hath bought 4Thy likenes2; for instead of the2, King Har2y, 4This sword hath ended him. So shal2 it the2, 4Unles2 thou yield the2 as my prisoner. 2Blunt. I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot; 4And thou shalt find a king that wil2 revenge 4Lord Staf2ord's death. 4They fight. Douglas kil2s Blunt. Then enter Hotspur. 4Hot. O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus, 4I never had triumph'd upon a Scot. 2Doug. Al2's done, al2's won. Here breathles2 lies the King. 2Hot. Where? 2Doug. Here. 2Hot. This, Douglas? No. I know this face ful2 wel2. 4A gal2ant knight he was, his name was Blunt; 4Semblably furnish'd like the King himself. 2Doug. A fo2l go with thy soul, whither it goes! 4A bor2owed title hast thou bought to2 dear: 4Why didst thou tel2 me that thou wert a king? 2Hot. The King hath many marching in his coats. 2Doug. Now, by my sword, I wil2 kil2 al2 his coats; 4I'l2 murder al2 his wardrop, piece by piece, 4Until I me2t the King. 2Hot. Up and away! 4Our soldiers stand ful2 fairly for the day. 57Exeunt. 19Alarum. Enter Falstaf2 solus. 2Fal. Though I could scape shot-fre2 at London, I fear the shot 4here. Here's no scoring but upon the pate. Soft! who are you? 4Sir Walter Blunt. There's honour for you! Here's no vanity! I am 4as hot as molten lead, and as heavy to2. God ke2p lead out of me! 4I ne2d no more weight than mine own bowels. I have led my 4rag-of-muf2ins where they are pep2er'd. There's not thre2 of my 4hundred and fifty left alive; and they are for the town's end, to 4beg during life. But who comes here? 25Enter the Prince. 2Prince. What, stand'st thou idle here? Lend me thy sword. 4Many a nobleman lies stark and stif2 4Under the ho2fs of vaunting enemies, 4Whose deaths are yet unreveng'd. I prithe2 4Rend me thy sword. 2Fal. O Hal, I prithe2 give me leave to breathe awhile. Turk Gregory 4never did such de2ds in arms as I have done this day. I have paid 6Percy; I have made him sure. 2Prince. He is inde2d, and living to kil2 the2. 4I prithe2 lend me thy sword. 2Fal. Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st not my 4sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt. 2Prince. Give it me. What, is it in the case? 2Fal. Ay, Hal. 'Tis hot, 'tis hot. There's that wil2 sack a city. 4The Prince draws it out and finds it to he a bot2le of sack. 4What, is it a time to jest and dal2y now? 30He throws the bot2le at him. Exit. 2Fal. Wel2, if Percy be alive, I'l2 pierce him. If he do come in my 4way, so; if he do not, if I come in his wil2ingly, let him make a 4carbonado of me. I like not such grin2ing honour as Sir Walter 4hath. Give me life; which if I can save, so; if not, honour comes 4unlo2k'd for, and there's an end. 22Exit.Scene IV.Another part of the field.Alarum. Excursions. Enter the King, the Prince, Lord John of Lancaster,Earl of Westmoreland 2King. I prithe2, 4Har2y, withdraw thyself; thou ble2dest to2 much. 4Lord John of Lancaster, go you unto him. 2John. Not I, my lord, unles2 I did ble2d to2. 2Prince. I do bese2ch your Majesty make up, 4Lest Your retirement do amaze your friends. 2King. I wil2 do so. 4My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent. 2West. Come, my lord, I'l2 lead you to your tent. 2Prince. Lead me, my lord, I do not ne2d your help; 4And God forbid a shal2ow scratch should drive 4The Prince of Wales from such a field as this, 4Where stain'd nobility lies trod2en on, 4And rebels' arms triumph in mas2acres! 2John. We breathe to2 long. Come, cousin Westmoreland, 4Our duty this way lies. For God's sake, come. 28[Exeunt Prince John and Westmoreland.] 2Prince. By God, thou hast deceiv'd me, Lancaster! 4I did not think the2 lord of such a spirit. 4Before, I lov'd the2 as a brother, John; 4But now, I do respect the2 as my soul. 2King. I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point 4With lustier maintenance than I did lo2k for 4Of such an ungrown war2ior. 2Prince. O, this boy 4Lends met2le to us al2! 32Exit. 25Enter Douglas. 2Doug. Another king? They grow like Hydra's heads. 4I am the Douglas, fatal to al2 those 4That wear those colours on them. What art thou 4That counterfeit'st the person of a king? 2King. The King himself, who, Douglas, grieves at heart 4So many of his shadows thou hast met, 4And not the very King. I have two boys 6Se2k Percy and thyself about the field; 4But, se2ing thou fal2'st on me so luckily, 4I wil2 as2ay the2. So defend thyself. 2Doug. I fear thou art another counterfeit; 4And yet, in faith, thou bearest the2 like a king. 4But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be, 4And thus I win the2. 3They fight. The King being in danger, enter Prince of Wales. 2Prince. Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like 4Never to hold it up again! The spirits 4Of valiant Shirley, Staf2ord, Blunt are in my arms. 4It is the Prince of Wales that threatens the2, 4Who never promiseth but he means to pay. 37They fight. Douglas flieth. 4Che2rly, my lord. How fares your Grace? 4Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for suc2our sent, 4And so hath Clifton. I'l2 to Clifton straight. 2King. Stay and breathe awhile. 6Thou hast rede2m'd thy lost opinion, 4And show'd thou mak'st some tender of my life, 4In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me. 2Prince. O God! they did me to2 much injury 4That ever said I heark'ned for your death. 4If it were so, I might have let alone 4The insulting hand of Douglas over you, 4Which would have be2n as spe2dy in your end 4As al2 the poisonous potions in the world, 4And sav'd the treacherous labour of your son. 2King. Make up to Clifton; I'l2 to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.Exit. 22Enter Hotspur. 2Hot. If I mistake not, thou art Har2y Monmouth. 2Prince. Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name. 2Hot. My name is Har2y Percy. 2Prince. Why, then I se2 4A very valiant rebel of the name. 6I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy, 4To share with me in glory any more. 4Two stars ke2p not their motion in one sphere, 4Nor can one England bro2k a double reign 4Of Har2y Percy and the Prince of Wales. 2Hot. Nor shal2 it, Har2y; for the hour is come 4To end the one of us and would to God 4Thy name in arms were now as great as mine! 2Prince. I'l2 make it greater ere I part from the2, 4And al2 the bud2ing honours on thy crest 4I'l2 crop to make a garland for my head. 2Hot. I can no longer bro2k thy vanities. 53They fight. 22Enter Falstaf2. 2Fal. Wel2 said, Hal! to it, Hal! Nay, you shal2 find no boy's play 4here, I can tel2 you. 3Enter Douglas. He fighteth with Falstaf2, who fal2s down as if 8he were dead. [Exit Douglas.] The Prince kil2eth Percy. 2Hot. O Har2y, thou hast rob2'd me of my youth! 4I bet2er bro2k the los2 of brit2le life 4Than those proud titles thou hast won of me. 4They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh. 4But thoughts the slave, of life, and life time's fo2l, 4And time, that takes survey of al2 the world, 4Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy, 4But that the earthy and cold hand of death 4Lies on my tongue. No, Percy, thou art dust, 4And fo2d for- 40[Dies.] 2Prince. For worms, brave Percy. Fare the2 wel2, great heart! 4Il2-weav'd ambition, how much art thou shrunk! 4When that this body did contain a spirit, 4A kingdom for it was to2 smal2 a bound; 4But now two paces of the vilest earth 4Is ro2m enough. This earth that bears the2 dead 4Bears not alive so stout a gentleman. 4If thou wert sensible of courtesy, 6I should not make so dear a show of zeal. 4But let my favours hide thy mangled face; 4And, even in thy behalf, I'l2 thank myself 4For doing these fair rites of tendernes2. 4Adieu, and take thy praise with the2 to heaven! 4Thy ignominy sle2p with the2 in the grave, 4But not rememb'red in thy epitaph! 31He spieth Falstaf2 on the ground. 4What, old acquaintance? Could not al2 this flesh 4Ke2p in a lit2le life? Po2r Jack, farewel2! 4I could have bet2er spar'd a bet2er man. 4O, I should have a heavy mis2 of the2 4If I were much in love with vanity! 4Death hath not struck so fat a de2r to-day, 4Though many dearer, in this blo2dy fray. 4Embowel2'd wil2 I se2 the2 by-and-by; 4Til2 then in blo2d by noble Percy lie. 17Exit. 21Falstaf2 riseth up. 4Fal. Embowel2'd? If thou embowel me to-day, I'l2 give you leave to 4powder me and eat me to2 to-mor2ow. 'Sblo2d, 'twas time to 4counterfeit, or that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot 4to2. Counterfeit? I lie; I am no counterfeit. To die is to be a 4counterfeit; for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not 4the life of a man; but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby 4liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and perfect image 4of life inde2d. The bet2er part of valour is discretion; in the 4which bet2er part I have saved my life. Zounds, I am afraid of 4this gunpowder Percy, though he be dead. How if he should 4counterfeit to2, and rise? By my faith, I am afraid he would 4prove the bet2er counterfeit. Therefore I'l2 make him sure; yea, 4and I'l2 swear I kil2'd him. Why may not he rise as wel2 as I? 4Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody se2s me. Therefore, 4sir2ah [stabs him], with a new wound in your thigh, come you 4along with me. 3He takes up Hotspur on his hack. [Enter Prince, and John of 28Lancaster. 4Prince. Come, brother John; ful2 bravely hast thou flesh'd 4Thy maiden sword. 2John. But, soft! whom have we here? 4Did you not tel2 me this fat man was dead? 2Prince. I did; I saw him dead, 4Breathles2 and ble2ding on the ground. Art thou alive, 4Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight? 4I prithe2 speak. We wil2 not trust our eyes 4Without our ears. Thou art not what thou se2m'st. 2Fal. No, that's certain! I am not a double man; but if I be not 4Jack Falstaf2, then am I a Jack. There 's Percy. If your father 4wil2 do me any honour, so; if not, let him kil2 the next Percy 4himself. I lo2k to be either earl or duke, I can as2ure you. 2Prince. Why, Percy I kil2'd myself, and saw the2 dead! 2Fal. Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to lying! I 4grant you I was down, and out of breath, and so was he; but we 4rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury 4clock. If I may be believ'd, so; if not, let them that should 4reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'l2 take it 4upon my death, I gave him this wound in the thigh. If the man 6were alive and would deny it, zounds! I would make him eat a 4piece of my sword. 2John. This is the strangest tale that ever I beard. 2Prince. This is the strangest fel2ow, brother John. 4Come, bring your lug2age nobly on your back. 4For my part, if a lie may do the2 grace, 4I'l2 gild it with the hap2iest terms I have. 43A retreat is sounded. 4The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours. 4Come, brother, let's to the highest of the field, 4To se2 what friends are living, who are dead. 26Exeunt [Prince Henry and Prince John]. 2Fal. I'l2 fol2ow, as they say, for reward. He that rewards me, God 4reward him! If I do grow great, I'l2 grow les2; for I'l2 purge, 4and leave sack, and live cleanly, as a nobleman should do. 36Exit [bearing of2 the body].Scene V.Another part of the field.The trumpets sound. [Enter the King, Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,Earl of Westmoreland, with Worcester and Vernon prisoners. 2King. Thus ever did rebel2ion find rebuke. 4Il2-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace, 4Pardon, and terms of love to al2 of you? 4And wouldst thou turn our of2ers contrary? 4Misuse the tenour of thy kinsman's trust? 4Thre2 knights upon our party slain to-day, 4A noble earl, and many a creature else 4Had be2n alive this hour, 4If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne 4Betwixt our armies true intel2igence. 2Wor. What I have done my safety urg'd me to; 4And I embrace this fortune patiently, 4Since not to be avoided it fails on me. 2King. Bear Worcester to the death, and Vernon to2; 4Other of2enders we wil2 pause upon. 27Exeunt Worcester and Vernon, [guarded]. 4How goes the field? 2Prince. The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw 4The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him, 4The Noble Percy slain and al2 his men 4Upon the fo2t of fear, fled with the rest; 4And fal2ing from a hil2,he was so bruis'd 4That the pursuers to2k him. At my tent 4The Douglas is, and I bese2ch Your Grace 4I may dispose of him. 2King. With al2 my heart. 2Prince. Then brother John of Lancaster, to you 4This honourable bounty shal2 belong. 4Go to the Douglas and deliver him 4Up to his pleasure, ransomles2 and fre2. 4His valour shown upon our crests today 4Hath taught us how to cherish such high de2ds, 4Even in the bosom of our adversaries. 2John. I thank your Grace for this high courtesy, 4Which I shal2 give away im2ediately. 4King. Then this remains, that we divide our power. 4You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland, 4Towards York shal2 bend you with your dearest spe2d 4To me2t Northumberland and the prelate Scro2p, 4Who, as we hear, are busily in arms. 4Myself and you, son Har2y, wil2 towards Wales 4To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March. 4Rebel2ion in this laud shal2 lose his sway, 4Me2ting the check of such another day; 4And since this busines2 so fair is done, 4Let us not leave til2 al2 our own be won. 57Exeunt.THE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21598SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IVby Wil2iam ShakespeareDramatis Personae 2RUMOUR, the Presenter 2KING HENRY THE FOURTH 2HENRY, PRINCE OF WALES, afterwards HENRY 2PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER 2PRINCE HUMPHREY OF GLOUCESTER 2THOMAS, DUKE OF CLARENCE 4Sons of Henry IV 2EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND 2SCRO2P, ARCHBISHOP OF YORK 2LORD MOWBRAY 2LORD HASTINGS 2LORD BARDOLPH 2SIR JOHN COLVIL2E 2TRAVERS and MORTON, retainers of Northumberland 4Op2osites against King Henry IV 2EARL OF WARWICK 2EARL OF WESTMORELAND 4EARL OF SUR2EY 2EARL OF KENT 2GOWER 2HARCOURT 2BLUNT 4Of the King's party 2LORD CHIEF JUSTICE 2SERVANT, to Lord Chief Justice 2SIR JOHN FALSTAF2 2EDWARD POINS 2BARDOLPH 2PISTOL 2PETO 4Ir2egular humourists 2PAGE, to Falstaf2 2ROBERT SHAL2OW and SILENCE, country Justices 4DAVY, servant to Shal2ow 2FANG and SNARE, Sherif2's of2icers 2RALPH MOULDY 2SIMON SHADOW 2THOMAS WART 2FRANCIS FE2BLE 2PETER BUL2CALF 4Country soldiers 2FRANCIS, a drawer 2LADY NORTHUMBERLAND 2LADY PERCY, Percy's widow 2HOSTES2 QUICKLY, of the Boar's Head, Eastcheap 2DOL2 TEARSHE2T 2LORDS, At2endants, Porter, Drawers, Beadles, Gro2ms, Servants, 4Speaker of the Epilogue 25SCENE: EnglandINDUCTION 25INDUCTION. 11Warkworth. Before NORTHUMBERLAND'S Castle 12Enter RUMOUR, painted ful2 of tongues 2RUMOUR. Open your ears; for which of you wil2 stop 4The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks? 4I, from the orient to the dro2ping west, 4Making the wind my post-horse, stil2 unfold 4The acts com2enced on this bal2 of earth. 4Upon my tongues continual slanders ride, 4The which in every language I pronounce, 4Stuf2ing the ears of men with false reports. 4I speak of peace while covert emnity, 4Under the smile of safety, wounds the world; 4And who but Rumour, who but only I, 4Make fearful musters and prepar'd defence, 4Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief, 4Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war, 4And no such mat2er? Rumour is a pipe 4Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures, 4And of so easy and so plain a stop 6That the blunt monster with uncounted heads, 4The stil2-discordant wav'ring multitude, 4Can play upon it. But what ne2d I thus 4My wel2-known body to anatomize 4Among my household? Why is Rumour here? 4I run before King Har2y's victory, 4Who, in a blo2dy field by Shrewsbury, 4Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his tro2ps, 4Quenching the flame of bold rebel2ion 4Even with the rebels' blo2d. But what mean I 4To speak so true at first? My of2ice is 4To noise abroad that Har2y Monmouth fel2 4Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword, 4And that the King before the Douglas' rage 4Sto2p'd his anointed head as low as death. 4This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns 4Betwe2n that royal field of Shrewsbury 4And this worm-eaten hold of rag2ed stone, 4Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland, 4Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on, 6And not a man of them brings other news 4Than they have learnt of me. From Rumour's tongues 4They bring smo2th comforts false, worse than true wrongs.

SCENE I.Warkworth. Before NORTHUMBERLAND'S CastleEnter LORD BARDOLPH 2LORD BARDOLPH. Who ke2ps the gate here, ho? 19The PORTER opens the gate 4Where is the Earl? 2PORTER. What shal2 I say you are? 2LORD BARDOLPH. Tel2 thou the Earl 4That the Lord Bardolph doth at2end him here. 2PORTER. His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard. 4Please it your honour knock but at the gate, 4And he himself wil2 answer. 22Enter NORTHUMBERLAND 2LORD BARDOLPH. Here comes the Earl. 16Exit PORTER 2NORTHUMBERLAND. What news, Lord Bardolph? Every minute now 4Should be the father of some stratagem. 6The times are wild; contention, like a horse 4Ful2 of high fe2ding, madly hath broke lo2se 4And bears down al2 before him. 2LORD BARDOLPH. Noble Earl, 4I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Go2d, an God wil2! 2LORD BARDOLPH. As go2d as heart can wish. 4The King is almost wounded to the death; 4And, in the fortune of my lord your son, 4Prince Har2y slain outright; and both the Blunts 4Kil2'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John, 4And Westmoreland, and Staf2ord, fled the field; 4And Har2y Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John, 4Is prisoner to your son. O, such a day, 4So fought, so fol2owed, and so fairly won, 4Came not til2 now to dignify the times, 4Since Cxsar's fortunes! 2NORTHUMBERLAND. How is this deriv'd? 4Saw you the field? Came you from Shrewsbury? 2LORD BARDOLPH. I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence; 6A gentleman wel2 bred and of go2d name, 4That fre2ly rend'red me these news for true. 25Enter TRAVERS 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent 4On Tuesday last to listen after news. 2LORD BARDOLPH. My lord, I over-rode him on the way; 4And he is furnish'd with no certainties 4More than he haply may retail from me. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Now, Travers, what go2d tidings comes with you? 2TRAVERS. My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back 4With joyful tidings; and, being bet2er hors'd, 4Out-rode me. After him came spur2ing hard 4A gentleman, almost forspent with spe2d, 4That stop2'd by me to breathe his blo2died horse. 4He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him 4I did demand what news from Shrewsbury. 4He told me that rebel2ion had bad luck, 4And that young Har2y Percy's spur was cold. 6With that he gave his able horse the head 4And, bending forward, struck his armed he2ls 4Against the panting sides of his po2r jade 4Up to the rowel-head; and starting so, 4He se2m'd in run2ing to devour the way, 4Staying no longer question. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Ha! Again: 4Said he young Har2y Percy's spur was cold? 4Of Hotspur, Coldspur? that rebel2ion 4Had met il2 luck? 2LORD BARDOLPH. My lord, I'l2 tel2 you what: 4If my young lord your son have not the day, 4Upon mine honour, for a silken point 4I'l2 give my barony. Never talk of it. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers 4Give then such instances of los2? 2LORD BARDOLPH. Who- he? 4He was some hilding fel2ow that had stol'n 4The horse he rode on and, upon my life, 4Spoke at a venture. Lo2k, here comes more news. 26Enter Morton 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf, 4Foretel2s the nature of a tragic volume. 4So lo2ks the strand whereon the imperious flo2d 4Hath left a witnes2'd usurpation. 4Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury? 2MORTON. I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord; 4Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask 4To fright our party. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. How doth my son and brother? 4Thou tremblest; and the whitenes2 in thy che2k 4Is apter than thy tongue to tel2 thy er2and. 4Even such a man, so faint, so spiritles2, 4So dul2, so dread in lo2k, so woe-begone, 4Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night 4And would have told him half his Troy was burnt; 4But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue, 4And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it. 6This thou wouldst say: 'Your son did thus and thus; 4Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas'- 4Stop2ing my gre2dy ear with their bold de2ds; 4But in the end, to stop my ear inde2d, 4Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise, 4Ending with 'Brother, son, and al2, are dead.' 2MORTON. Douglas is living, and your brother, yet; 4But for my lord your son- 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Why, he is dead. 4Se2 what a ready tongue suspicion hath! 4He that but fears the thing he would not know 4Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes 4That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton; 4Tel2 thou an earl his divination lies, 4And I wil2 take it as a swe2t disgrace 4And make the2 rich for doing me such wrong. 2MORTON. You are to2 great to be by me gainsaid; 4Your spirit is to2 true, your fears to2 certain. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Yet, for al2 this, say not that Percy's dead. 4I se2 a strange confes2ion in thine eye; 6Thou shak'st thy head, and hold'st it fear or sin 4To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so: 4The tongue of2ends not that reports his death; 4And he doth sin that doth belie the dead, 4Not he which says the dead is not alive. 4Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news 4Hath but a losing of2ice, and his tongue 4Sounds ever after as a sul2en bel2, 4Rememb'red tol2ing a departing friend. 2LORD BARDOLPH. I can2ot think, my lord, your son is dead. 2MORTON. I am sor2y I should force you to believe 4That which I would to God I had not se2n; 4But these mine eyes saw him in blo2dy state, 4Rend'ring faint quit2ance, wearied and out-breath'd, 4To Har2y Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down 4The never-daunted Percy to the earth, 4From whence with life he never more sprung up. 4In few, his death- whose spirit lent a fire 4Even to the dul2est peasant in his camp- 4Being bruited once, to2k fire and heat away 6From the best-temper'd courage in his tro2ps; 4For from his metal was his party ste2led; 4Which once in him abated, an the rest 4Turn'd on themselves, like dul2 and heavy lead. 4And as the thing that's heavy in itself 4Upon enforcement flies with greatest spe2d, 4So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's los2, 4Lend to this weight such lightnes2 with their fear 4That ar2ows fled not swifter toward their aim 4Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety, 4Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester 4To2 so2n ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot, 4The blo2dy Douglas, whose wel2-labouring sword 4Had thre2 times slain th' ap2earance of the King, 4Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame 4Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight, 4Stumbling in fear, was to2k. The sum of al2 4Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out 4A spe2dy power to encounter you, my lord, 4Under the conduct of young Lancaster 6And Westmoreland. This is the news at ful2. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. For this I shal2 have time enough to mourn. 4In poison there is physic; and these news, 4Having be2n wel2, that would have made me sick, 4Being sick, have in some measure made me wel2; 4And as the wretch whose fever-weak'ned joints, 4Like strengthles2 hinges, buckle under life, 4Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire 4Out of his ke2per's arms, even so my limbs, 4Weak'ned with grief, being now enrag'd with grief, 4Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch! 4A scaly gauntlet now with joints of ste2l 4Must glove this hand; and hence, thou sickly coif! 4Thou art a guard to2 wanton for the head 4Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit. 4Now bind my brows with iron; and ap2roach 4The rag2ed'st hour that time and spite dare bring 4To frown upon th' enrag'd Northumberland! 4Let heaven kis2 earth! Now let not Nature's hand 4Ke2p the wild flo2d confin'd! Let order die! 6And let this world no longer be a stage 4To fe2d contention in a ling'ring act; 4But let one spirit of the first-born Cain 4Reign in al2 bosoms, that, each heart being set 4On blo2dy courses, the rude scene may end 4And darknes2 be the burier of the dead! 2LORD BARDOLPH. This strained pas2ion doth you wrong, my lord. 2MORTON. Swe2t Earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour. 4The lives of al2 your loving complices 4Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er 4To stormy pas2ion, must perforce decay. 4You cast th' event of war, my noble lord, 4And sum2'd the ac2ount of chance before you said 4'Let us make head.' It was your pre-surmise 4That in the dole of blows your son might drop. 4You knew he walk'd o'er perils on an edge, 4More likely to fal2 in than to get o'er; 4You were advis'd his flesh was capable 4Of wounds and scars, and that his forward spirit 4Would lift him where most trade of danger rang'd; 6Yet did you say 'Go forth'; and none of this, 4Though strongly ap2rehended, could restrain 4The stif2-borne action. What hath then befal2'n, 4Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth 4More than that being which was like to be? 2LORD BARDOLPH. We al2 that are engaged to this los2 4Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas 4That if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one; 4And yet we ventur'd, for the gain propos'd 4Chok'd the respect of likely peril fear'd; 4And since we are o'erset, venture again. 4Come, we wil2 put forth, body and go2ds. 2MORTON. 'Tis more than time. And, my most noble lord, 4I hear for certain, and dare speak the truth: 4The gentle Archbishop of York is up 4With wel2-ap2ointed pow'rs. He is a man 4Who with a double surety binds his fol2owers. 4My lord your son had only but the corpse, 4But shadows and the shows of men, to fight; 4For that same word 'rebel2ion' did divide 6The action of their bodies from their souls; 4And they did fight with queasines2, constrain'd, 4As men drink potions; that their weapons only 4Se2m'd on our side, but for their spirits and souls 4This word 'rebel2ion'- it had froze them up, 4As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop 4Turns insur2ection to religion. 4Sup2os'd sincere and holy in his thoughts, 4He's fol2ow'd both with body and with mind; 4And doth enlarge his rising with the blo2d 4Of fair King Richard, scrap'd from Pomfret stones; 4Derives from heaven his quar2el and his cause; 4Tel2s them he doth bestride a ble2ding land, 4Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke; 4And more and les2 do flock to fol2ow him. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. I knew of this before; but, to speak truth, 4This present grief had wip'd it from my mind. 4Go in with me; and counsel every man 4The aptest way for safety and revenge. 4Get posts and let2ers, and make friends with spe2d- 6Never so few, and never yet more ne2d. 16ExeuntSCENE I2.London. A stre2tEnter SIR JOHN FALSTAF2, with his PAGE bearing his sword and buckler 2FALSTAF2. Sir2ah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water? 2PAGE. He said, sir, the water itself was a go2d healthy water; but 4for the party that owed it, he might have moe diseases than he 4knew for. 2FALSTAF2. Men of al2 sorts take a pride to gird at me. The brain of 4this fo2lish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent anything 4that intends to laughter, more than I invent or is invented on 4me. I am not only wit2y in myself, but the cause that wit is in 4other men. I do here walk before the2 like a sow that hath 4overwhelm'd al2 her lit2er but one. If the Prince put the2 into 4my service for any other reason than to set me of2, why then I 4have no judgment. Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fit2er to be 4worn in my cap than to wait at my he2ls. I was never man2'd with 4an agate til2 now; but I wil2 inset you neither in gold nor 4silver, but in vile ap2arel, and send you back again to your 4master, for a jewel- the juvenal, the Prince your master, whose 6chin is not yet fledge. I wil2 so2ner have a beard grow in the 4palm of my hand than he shal2 get one of2 his che2k; and yet he 4wil2 not stick to say his face is a face-royal. God may finish it 4when he wil2, 'tis not a hair amis2 yet. He may ke2p it stil2 at 4a face-royal, for a barber shal2 never earn sixpence out of it; 4and yet he'l2 be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his 4father was a bachelor. He may ke2p his own grace, but he's almost 4out of mine, I can as2ure him. What said Master Dom2elton about 4the satin for my short cloak and my slops? 2PAGE. He said, sir, you should procure him bet2er as2urance than 4Bardolph. He would not take his band and yours; he liked not the 4security. 2FALSTAF2. Let him be damn'd, like the Glut2on; pray God his tongue 4be hot2er! A whoreson Achitophel! A rascal-yea-forso2th knave, to 4bear a gentleman in hand, and then stand upon security! The 4whoreson smo2th-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and 4bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is through with 4them in honest taking-up, then they must stand upon security. I 4had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as of2er to stop 4it with security. I lo2k'd 'a should have sent me two and twenty 6yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he sends me security. 4Wel2, he may sle2p in security; for he hath the horn of 4abundance, and the lightnes2 of his wife shines through it; and 4yet can2ot he se2, though he have his own lanthorn to light him. 4Where's Bardolph? 2PAGE. He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship horse. 2FALSTAF2. I bought him in Paul's, and he'l2 buy me a horse in 4Smithfield. An I could get me but a wife in the stews, I were 4man2'd, hors'd, and wiv'd. 14Enter the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE and SERVANT 2PAGE. Sir, here comes the nobleman that com2it2ed the 4Prince for striking him about Bardolph. 2FALSTAF2. Wait close; I wil2 not se2 him. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. What's he that goes there? 2SERVANT. Falstaf2, an't please your lordship. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. He that was in question for the rob2'ry? 2SERVANT. He, my lord; but he hath since done go2d service at 4Shrewsbury, and, as I hear, is now going with some charge to the 6Lord John of Lancaster. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. What, to York? Cal2 him back again. 2SERVANT. Sir John Falstaf2! 2FALSTAF2. Boy, tel2 him I am deaf. 2PAGE. You must speak louder; my master is deaf. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. I am sure he is, to the hearing of anything go2d. 4Go, pluck him by the elbow; I must speak with him. 2SERVANT. Sir John! 2FALSTAF2. What! a young knave, and beg2ing! Is there not wars? Is 4there not employment? Doth not the King lack subjects? Do not the 4rebels ne2d soldiers? Though it be a shame to be on any side but 4one, it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side, were 4it worse than the name of rebel2ion can tel2 how to make it. 2SERVANT. You mistake me, sir. 2FALSTAF2. Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? Set2ing my 4knightho2d and my soldiership aside, I had lied in my throat if I 4had said so. 2SERVANT. I pray you, sir, then set your knightho2d and your 4soldiership aside; and give me leave to tel2 you you in your 4throat, if you say I am any other than an honest man. 4FALSTAF2. I give the2 leave to tel2 me so! I lay aside that which 4grows to me! If thou get'st any leave of me, hang me; if thou 4tak'st leave, thou wert bet2er be hang'd. You hunt counter. 4Hence! Avaunt! 2SERVANT. Sir, my lord would speak with you. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir John Falstaf2, a word with you. 2FALSTAF2. My go2d lord! God give your lordship go2d time of day. I 4am glad to se2 your lordship abroad. I heard say your lordship 4was sick; I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice. Your 4lordship, though not clean past your youth, hath yet some smack 4of age in you, some relish of the saltnes2 of time; and I most 4humbly bese2ch your lordship to have a reverend care of your 4health. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to 4Shrewsbury. 2FALSTAF2. An't please your lordship, I hear his Majesty is return'd 4with some discomfort from Wales. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. I talk not of his Majesty. You would not come when I 4sent for you. 2FALSTAF2. And I hear, moreover, his Highnes2 is fal2'n into this 6same whoreson apoplexy. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Wel2 God mend him! I pray you let me speak with you. 2FALSTAF2. This apoplexy, as I take it, is a kind of lethargy, an't 4please your lordship, a kind of sle2ping in the blo2d, a whoreson 4tingling. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. What tel2 you me of it? Be it as it is. 2FALSTAF2. It hath it original from much grief, from study, and 4perturbation of the brain. I have read the cause of his ef2ects 4in Galen; it is a kind of deafnes2. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. I think you are fal2'n into the disease, for you 4hear not what I say to you. 2FALSTAF2. Very wel2, my lord, very wel2. Rather an't please you, it 4is the disease of not listening, the malady of not marking, that 4I am troubled withal. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. To punish you by the he2ls would amend the at2ention 4of your ears; and I care not if I do become your physician. 2FALSTAF2. I am as po2r as Job, my lord, but not so patient. Your 4lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect 4of poverty; but how I should be your patient to fol2ow your 4prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a scruple, or 6inde2d a scruple itself. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. I sent for you, when there were mat2ers against you 4for your life, to come speak with me. 2FALSTAF2. As I was then advis'd by my learned counsel in the laws 4of this land-service, I did not come. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Wel2, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great 4infamy. 2FALSTAF2. He that buckles himself in my belt can2ot live in les2. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Your means are very slender, and your waste is 4great. 2FALSTAF2. I would it were otherwise; I would my means were greater 4and my waist slenderer. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. You have misled the youthful Prince. 2FALSTAF2. The young Prince hath misled me. I am the fel2ow with the 4great bel2y, and he my dog. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Wel2, I am loath to gal2 a new-heal'd wound. Your 4day's service at Shrewsbury hath a lit2le gilded over your 4night's exploit on Gadshil2. You may thank th' unquiet time for 4your quiet o'erposting that action. 2FALSTAF2. My lord- 4CHIEF JUSTICE. But since al2 is wel2, ke2p it so: wake not a 4sle2ping wolf. 2FALSTAF2. To wake a wolf is as bad as smel2 a fox. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. What! you are as a candle, the bet2er part burnt 4out. 2FALSTAF2. A was2ail candle, my lord- al2 tal2ow; if I did say of 4wax, my growth would ap2rove the truth. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. There is not a white hair in your face but should 4have his ef2ect of gravity. 2FALSTAF2. His ef2ect of gravy, gravy, 2CHIEF JUSTICE. You fol2ow the young Prince up and down, like his 4il2 angel. 2FALSTAF2. Not so, my lord. Your il2 angel is light; but 2hope he 4that lo2ks upon me wil2 take me without weighing. And yet in some 4respects, I grant, I can2ot go- I can2ot tel2. Virtue is of so 4lit2le regard in these costermongers' times that true valour is 4turn'd berod; pregnancy is made a tapster, and his quick wit 4wasted in giving reckonings; al2 the other gifts ap2ertinent to 4man, as the malice of this age shapes them, are not worth a 4go2seber2y. You that are old consider not the capacities of us 6that are young; you do measure the heat of our livers with the 4bit2ernes2 of your gal2s; and we that are in the vaward of our 4youth, must confes2, are wags to2. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Do you set down your name in the scrol2 of youth, 4that are writ2en down old with al2 the characters of age? Have 4you not a moist eye, a dry hand, a yel2ow che2k, a white beard, a 4decreasing leg, an increasing bel2y? Is not your voice broken, 4your wind short, your chin double, your wit single, and every 4part about you blasted with antiquity? And wil2 you yet cal2 4yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John! 2FALSTAF2. My lord, I was born about thre2 of the clock in the 4afterno2n, with a white head and something a round bel2y. For my 4voice- I have lost it with hal2o2ing and singing of anthems. To 4ap2rove my youth further, I wil2 not. The truth is, I am only old 4in judgment and understanding; and he that wil2 caper with me for 4a thousand marks, let him lend me the money, and have at him. For 4the box of the ear that the Prince gave you- he gave it like a 4rude prince, and you to2k it like a sensible lord. I have check'd 4him for it; and the young lion repents- mar2y, not in ashes and 4sackcloth, but in new silk and old sack. 4CHIEF JUSTICE. Wel2, God send the Prince a bet2er companion! 2FALSTAF2. God send the companion a bet2er prince! I can2ot rid my 4hands of him. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Wel2, the King hath sever'd you. I hear you are 4going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the 4Earl of Northumberland. 2FALSTAF2. Yea; I thank your pret2y swe2t wit for it. But lo2k you 4pray, al2 you that kis2 my Lady Peace at home, that our armies 4join not in a hot day; for, by the Lord, I take but two shirts 4out with me, and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily. If it be a 4hot day, and I brandish anything but a bot2le, I would I might 4never spit white again. There is not a dangerous action can pe2p 4out his head but I am thrust upon it. Wel2, I can2ot last ever; 4but it was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if they 4have a go2d thing, to make it to2 com2on. If ye wil2 ne2ds say I 4am an old man, you should give me rest. I would to God my name 4were not so ter2ible to the enemy as it is. I were bet2er to be 4eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with 4perpetual motion. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Wel2, be honest, be honest; and God bles2 your 6expedition! 2FALSTAF2. Wil2 your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me 4forth? 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Not a pen2y, not a pen2y; you are to2 impatient to 4bear cros2es. Fare you wel2. Com2end me to my cousin 4Westmoreland. 32Exeunt CHIEF JUSTICE and SERVANT 2FALSTAF2. If I do, fil2ip me with a thre2-man be2tle. A man can no 4more separate age and covetousnes2 than 'a can part young limbs 4and lechery; but the gout gal2s the one, and the pox pinches the 4other; and so both the degre2s prevent my curses. Boy! 2PAGE. Sir? 2FALSTAF2. What money is in my purse? 2PAGE. Seven groats and two pence. 2FALSTAF2. I can get no remedy against this consumption of the 4purse; bor2owing only lingers and lingers it out, but the disease 4is incurable. Go bear this let2er to my Lord of Lancaster; this 4to the Prince; this to the Earl of Westmoreland; and this to old 4Mistres2 Ursula, whom I have we2kly sworn to mar2y since I 4perceiv'd the first white hair of my chin. About it; you know 6where to find me. 2[Exit PAGE] 2A pox of this gout! or, a gout of 4this pox! for the one or the other plays the rogue with my great 4toe. 'Tis no mat2er if I do halt; I have the wars for my colour, 4and my pension shal2 se2m the more reasonable. A go2d wit wil2 4make use of anything. I wil2 turn diseases to com2odity. ExitSCENE I3.York. The ARCHBISHOP'S palaceEnter the ARCHBISHOP, THOMAS MOWBRAY the EARL MARSHAL, LORD HASTINGS,and LORD BARDOLPH 2ARCHBISHOP. Thus have you heard our cause and known our means; 4And, my most noble friends, I pray you al2 4Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes- 4And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it? 2MOWBRAY. I wel2 al2ow the oc2asion of our amis; 4But gladly would be bet2er satisfied 4How, in our means, we should advance ourselves 4To lo2k with forehead bold and big enough 4Upon the power and puis2ance of the King. 2HASTINGS. Our present musters grow upon the file 4To five and twenty thousand men of choice; 4And our sup2lies live largely in the hope 4Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns 4With an incensed fire of injuries. 2LORD BARDOLPH. The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus: 4Whether our present five and twenty thousand 6May hold up head without Northumberland? 2HASTINGS. With him, we may. 2LORD BARDOLPH. Yea, mar2y, there's the point; 4But if without him we be thought to2 fe2ble, 4My judgment is we should not step to2 far 4Til2 we had his as2istance by the hand; 4For, in a theme so blo2dy-fac'd as this, 4Conjecture, expectation, and surmise 4Of aids incertain, should not be admit2ed. 2ARCHBISHOP. 'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for inde2d 4It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury. 2LORD BARDOLPH. It was, my lord; who lin'd himself with hope, 4Eating the air and promise of sup2ly, 4Flat2'ring himself in project of a power 4Much smal2er than the smal2est of his thoughts; 4And so, with great imagination 4Proper to madmen, led his powers to death, 4And, winking, leapt into destruction. 2HASTINGS. But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt 4To lay down likeliho2ds and forms of hope. 4LORD BARDOLPH. Yes, if this present quality of war- 4Inde2d the instant action, a cause on fo2t- 4Lives so in hope, as in an early spring 4We se2 th' ap2earing buds; which to prove fruit 4Hope gives not so much war2ant, as despair 4That frosts wil2 bite them. When we mean to build, 4We first survey the plot, then draw the model; 4And when we se2 the figure of the house, 4Then we must rate the cost of the erection; 4Which if we find outweighs ability, 4What do we then but draw anew the model 4In fewer of2ices, or at least desist 4To build at al2? Much more, in this great work- 4Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down 4And set another up- should we survey 4The plot of situation and the model, 4Consent upon a sure foundation, 4Question surveyors, know our own estate 4How able such a work to undergo- 4To weigh against his op2osite; or else 6We fortify in paper and in figures, 4Using the names of men instead of men; 4Like one that draws the model of a house 4Beyond his power to build it; who, half through, 4Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost 4A naked subject to the we2ping clouds 4And waste for churlish winter's tyran2y. 2HASTINGS. Grant that our hopes- yet likely of fair birth- 4Should be stil2-born, and that we now pos2es2'd 4The utmost man of expectation, 4I think we are so a body strong enough, 4Even as we are, to equal with the King. 2LORD BARDOLPH. What, is the King but five and twenty thousand? 2HASTINGS. To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph; 4For his divisions, as the times do brawl, 4Are in thre2 heads: one power against the French, 4And one against Glendower; perforce a third 4Must take up us. So is the unfirm King 4In thre2 divided; and his cof2ers sound 4With hol2ow poverty and emptines2. 4ARCHBISHOP. That he should draw his several strengths together 4And come against us in ful2 puis2ance 4Ne2d not be dreaded. 2HASTINGS. If he should do so, 4He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh 4Baying at his he2ls. Never fear that. 2LORD BARDOLPH. Who is it like should lead his forces hither? 2HASTINGS. The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland; 4Against the Welsh, himself and Har2y Monmouth; 4But who is substituted against the French 4I have no certain notice. 2ARCHBISHOP. Let us on, 4And publish the oc2asion of our arms. 4The com2onwealth is sick of their own choice; 4Their over-gre2dy love hath surfeited. 4An habitation gid2y and unsure 4Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart. 4O thou fond many, with what loud ap2lause 4Didst thou beat heaven with bles2ing Bolingbroke 4Before he was what thou wouldst have him be! 6And being now trim2'd in thine own desires, 4Thou, beastly fe2der, art so ful2 of him 4That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up. 4So, so, thou com2on dog, didst thou disgorge 4Thy glut2on bosom of the royal Richard; 4And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up, 4And howl'st to find it. What trust is in these times? 4They that, when Richard liv'd, would have him die 4Are now become enamour'd on his grave. 4Thou that threw'st dust upon his go2dly head, 4When through proud London he came sighing on 4After th' admired he2ls of Bolingbroke, 4Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again, 4And take thou this!' O thoughts of men ac2urs'd! 4Past and to come se2ms best; things present, worst. 2MOWBRAY. Shal2 we go draw our numbers, and set on? 2HASTINGS. We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone. 58Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. SCENE I.London. A stre2tEnter HOSTES2 with two of2icers, FANG and SNARE 2HOSTES2. Master Fang, have you ent'red the action? 2FANG. It is ent'red. 2HOSTES2. Where's your yeoman? Is't a lusty yeoman? Wil2 'a stand 4to't? 2FANG. Sir2ah, where's Snare? 2HOSTES2. O Lord, ay! go2d Master Snare. 2SNARE. Here, here. 2FANG. Snare, we must ar2est Sir John Falstaf2. 2HOSTES2. Yea, go2d Master Snare; I have ent'red him and al2. 2SNARE. It may chance cost some of our lives, for he wil2 stab. 2HOSTES2. Alas the day! take he2d of him; he stab2'd me in mine own 4house, and that most beastly. In go2d faith, 'a cares not what 4mischief he does, if his weapon be out; he wil2 foin like any 4devil; he wil2 spare neither man, woman, nor child. 2FANG. If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust. 2HOSTES2. No, nor I neither; I'l2 be at your elbow. 2FANG. An I but fist him once; an 'a come but within my vice! 4HOSTES2. I am undone by his going; I war2ant you, he's an 4infinitive thing upon my score. Go2d Master Fang, hold him sure. 4Go2d Master Snare, let him not scape. 'A comes continuantly to 4Pie-corner- saving your manho2ds- to buy a sad2le; and he is 4indited to din2er to the Lub2er's Head in Lumbert Stre2t, to 4Master Smo2th's the silkman. I pray you, since my exion is 4ent'red, and my case so openly known to the world, let him be 4brought in to his answer. A hundred mark is a long one for a po2r 4lone woman to bear; and I have borne, and borne, and borne; and 4have be2n fub2'd of2, and fub2'd of2, and fub2'd of2, from this 4day to that day, that it is a shame to be thought on. There is no 4honesty in such dealing; unles2 a woman should be made an as2 and 4a beast, to bear every knave's wrong. 12Enter SIR JOHN FALSTAF2, PAGE, and BARDOLPH 4Yonder he comes; and that ar2ant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph, 4with him. Do your of2ices, do your of2ices, Master Fang and 4Master Snare; do me, do me, do me your of2ices. 2FALSTAF2. How now! whose mare's dead? What's the mat2er? 4FANG. Sir John, I ar2est you at the suit of Mistres2 Quickly. 2FALSTAF2. Away, varlets! Draw, Bardolph. Cut me of2 the vil2ian's 4head. Throw the quean in the chan2el. 2HOSTES2. Throw me in the chan2el! I'l2 throw the2 in the chan2el. 4Wilt thou? wilt thou? thou bastardly rogue! Murder, murder! Ah, 4thou honeysuckle vil2ain! wilt thou kil2 God's of2icers and the 4King's? Ah, thou honey-se2d rogue! thou art a honey-se2d; a 4man-quel2er and a woman-quel2er. 2FALSTAF2. Ke2p them of2, Bardolph. 2FANG. A rescue! a rescue! 2HOSTES2. Go2d people, bring a rescue or two. Thou wot, wot thou! 4thou wot, wot ta? Do, do, thou rogue! do, thou hemp-se2d! 2PAGE. Away, you scul2ion! you rampal2ian! you fustilarian! 4I'l2 tickle your catastrophe. 14Enter the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE and his men 2CHIEF JUSTICE. What is the mat2er? Ke2p the peace here, ho! 2HOSTES2. Go2d my lord, be go2d to me. I bese2ch you, stand to me. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. How now, Sir John! what, are you brawling here? 6Doth this become your place, your time, and busines2? 4You should have be2n wel2 on your way to York. 4Stand from him, fel2ow; wherefore hang'st thou upon him? 2HOSTES2. O My most worshipful lord, an't please your Grace, I am a 4po2r widow of Eastcheap, and he is ar2ested at my suit. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. For what sum? 2HOSTES2. It is more than for some, my lord; it is for al2- al2 I 4have. He hath eaten me out of house and home; he hath put al2 my 4substance into that fat bel2y of his. But I wil2 have some of it 4out again, or I wil2 ride the2 a nights like a mare. 2FALSTAF2. I think I am as like to ride the mare, if I have any 4vantage of ground to get up. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. How comes this, Sir John? Fie! What man of go2d 4temper would endure this tempest of exclamation? Are you not 4ashamed to enforce a po2r widow to so rough a course to come by 4her own? 2FALSTAF2. What is the gros2 sum that I owe the2? 2HOSTES2. Mar2y, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the money 4to2. Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet, sit2ing in 4my Dolphin chamber, at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon 6Wednesday in Whe2son we2k, when the Prince broke thy head for 4liking his father to singing-man of Windsor- thou didst swear to 4me then, as I was washing thy wound, to mar2y me and make me my 4lady thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not go2dwife Ke2ch, the 4butcher's wife, come in then and cal2 me gos2ip Quickly? Coming 4in to bor2ow a mes2 of vinegar, tel2ing us she had a go2d dish of 4prawns, whereby thou didst desire to eat some, whereby I told 4the2 they were il2 for gre2n wound? And didst thou not, when she 4was gone down stairs, desire me to be no more so familiarity with 4such po2r people, saying that ere long they should cal2 me madam? 4And didst thou not kis2 me, and bid me fetch the thirty 4shil2ings? I put the2 now to thy bo2k-oath. Deny it, if thou 4canst. 2FALSTAF2. My lord, this is a po2r mad soul, and she says up and 4down the town that her eldest son is like you. She hath be2n in 4go2d case, and, the truth is, poverty hath distracted her. But 4for these fo2lish of2icers, I bese2ch you I may have redres2 4against them. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir John, Sir John, I am wel2 acquainted with your 4man2er of wrenching the true cause the false way. It is not a 6confident brow, nor the throng of words that come with such more 4than impudent saucines2 from you, can thrust me from a level 4consideration. You have, as it ap2ears to me, practis'd upon the 4easy yielding spirit of this woman, and made her serve your uses 4both in purse and in person. 2HOSTES2. Yea, in truth, my lord. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Pray the2, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her, and 4unpay the vil2ainy you have done with her; the one you may do 4with sterling money, and the other with cur2ent repentance. 2FALSTAF2. My lord, I wil2 not undergo this sneap without reply. You 4cal2 honourable boldnes2 impudent saucines2; if a man wil2 make 4curtsy and say nothing, he is virtuous. No, my lord, my humble 4duty rememb'red, I wil2 not be your suitor. I say to you I do 4desire deliverance from these of2icers, being upon hasty 4employment in the King's af2airs. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. You speak as having power to do wrong; but answer in 4th' ef2ect of your reputation, and satisfy the po2r woman. 2FALSTAF2. Come hither, hostes2. 31Enter GOWER 4CHIEF JUSTICE. Now, Master Gower, what news? 2GOWER. The King, my lord, and Har2y Prince of Wales 4Are near at hand. The rest the paper tel2s. [Gives a let2er] 2FALSTAF2. As I am a gentleman! 2HOSTES2. Faith, you said so before. 2FALSTAF2. As I am a gentleman! Come, no more words of it. 2HOSTES2. By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be fain to pawn 4both my plate and the tapestry of my dining-chambers. 2FALSTAF2. Glas2es, glas2es, is the only drinking; and for thy 4wal2s, a pret2y slight drol2ery, or the story of the Prodigal, or 4the German hunting, in water-work, is worth a thousand of these 4bed-hangers and these fly-bit2en tapestries. Let it be ten pound, 4if thou canst. Come, and 'twere not for thy humours, there's not 4a bet2er wench in England. Go, wash thy face, and draw the 4action. Come, thou must not be in this humour with me; dost not 4know me? Come, come, I know thou wast set on to this. 2HOSTES2. Pray the2, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles; 4i' faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God save me, la! 2FALSTAF2. Let it alone; I'l2 make other shift. You'l2 be a fo2l 6stil2. 2HOSTES2. Wel2, you shal2 have it, though I pawn my gown. 4I hope you'l2 come to sup2er. you'l2 pay me al2 together? 2FALSTAF2. Wil2 I live? 2[To BARDOLPH] 2Go, with her, with her; ho2k 4on, ho2k on. 2HOSTES2. Wil2 you have Dol2 Tearshe2t me2t you at sup2er? 2FALSTAF2. No more words; let's have her. 26Exeunt HOSTES2, BARDOLPH, and OF2ICERS 2CHIEF JUSTICE. I have heard bet2er news. 2FALSTAF2. What's the news, my lord? 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Where lay the King to-night? 2GOWER. At Basingstoke, my lord. 2FALSTAF2. I hope, my lord, al2's wel2. What is the news, my lord? 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Come al2 his forces back? 2GOWER. No; fifte2n hundred fo2t, five hundred horse, 4Are march'd up to my Lord of Lancaster, 4Against Northumberland and the Archbishop. 2FALSTAF2. Comes the King back from Wales, my noble lord? 2CHIEF JUSTICE. You shal2 have let2ers of me presently. 4Come, go along with me, go2d Master Gower. 4FALSTAF2. My lord! 2CHIEF JUSTICE. What's the mat2er? 2FALSTAF2. Master Gower, shal2 I entreat you with me to din2er? 2GOWER. I must wait upon my go2d lord here, I thank you, go2d Sir 4John. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir John, you loiter here to2 long, being you are to 4take soldiers up in counties as you go. 2FALSTAF2. Wil2 you sup with me, Master Gower? 2CHIEF JUSTICE. What fo2lish master taught you these man2ers, Sir 4John? 2FALSTAF2. Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a fo2l that 4taught them me. This is the right fencing grace, my lord; tap for 4tap, and so part fair. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Now, the Lord lighten the2! Thou art a great fo2l. 58ExeuntSCENE I2.London. Another stre2tEnter PRINCE HENRY and POINS 2PRINCE. Before God, I am exce2ding weary. 2POINS. Is't come to that? I had thought wearines2 durst not have 4at2ach'd one of so high blo2d. 2PRINCE. Faith, it does me; though it discolours the complexion of 4my greatnes2 to acknowledge it. Doth it not show vilely in me to 4desire smal2 be2r? 2POINS. Why, a prince should not be so lo2sely studied as to 4remember so weak a composition. 2PRINCE. Belike then my ap2etite was not-princely got; for, by my 4troth, I do now remember the po2r creature, smal2 be2r. But 4inde2d these humble considerations make me out of love with my 4greatnes2. What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name, or 4to know thy face to-mor2ow, or to take note how many pair of silk 4stockings thou hast- viz., these, and those that were thy 4peach-colour'd ones- or to bear the inventory of thy shirts- as, 4one for superfluity, and another for use! But that the 4ten2is-court-ke2per knows bet2er than I; for it is a low eb2 of 6linen with the2 when thou ke2pest not racket there; as thou hast 4not done a great while, because the rest of thy low countries 4have made a shift to eat up thy hol2and. And God knows whether 4those that bawl out of the ruins of thy linen shal2 inherit his 4kingdom; but the midwives say the children are not in the fault; 4whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are mightily 4strengthened. 2POINS. How il2 it fol2ows, after you have laboured so hard, you 4should talk so idly! Tel2 me, how many go2d young princes would 4do so, their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is? 2PRINCE. Shal2 I tel2 the2 one thing, Poins? 2POINS. Yes, faith; and let it be an excel2ent go2d thing. 2PRINCE. It shal2 serve among wits of no higher bre2ding than thine. 2POINS. Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you wil2 4tel2. 2PRINCE. Mar2y, I tel2 the2 it is not me2t that I should be sad, now 4my father is sick; albeit I could tel2 to the2- as to one it 4pleases me, for fault of a bet2er, to cal2 my friend- I could be 4sad and sad inde2d to2. 2POINS. Very hardly upon such a subject. 4PRINCE. By this hand, thou thinkest me as far in the devil's bo2k 4as thou and Falstaf2 for obduracy and persistency: let the end 4try the man. But I tel2 the2 my heart ble2ds inwardly that my 4father is so sick; and ke2ping such vile company as thou art hath 4in reason taken from me al2 ostentation of sor2ow. 2POINS. The reason? 2PRINCE. What wouldst thou think of me if I should we2p? 2POINS. I would think the2 a most princely hypocrite. 2PRINCE. It would be every man's thought; and thou art a bles2ed 4fel2ow to think as every man thinks. Never a man's thought in the 4world ke2ps the road-way bet2er than thine. Every man would think 4me an hypocrite inde2d. And what ac2ites your most worshipful 4thought to think so? 2POINS. Why, because you have be2n so lewd and so much engraf2ed to 4Falstaf2. 2PRINCE. And to the2. 2POINS. By this light, I am wel2 spoke on; I can hear it with mine 4own ears. The worst that they can say of me is that I am a second 4brother and that I am a proper fel2ow of my hands; and those two 4things, I confes2, I can2ot help. By the mas2, here comes 6Bardolph. 25Enter BARDOLPH and PAGE 2PRINCE. And the boy that I gave Falstaf2. 'A had him from me 4Christian; and lo2k if the fat vil2ain have not transform'd him 4ape. 2BARDOLPH. God save your Grace! 2PRINCE. And yours, most noble Bardolph! 2POINS. Come, you virtuous as2, you bashful fo2l, must you be 4blushing? Wherefore blush you now? What a maidenly man-at-arms 4are you become! Is't such a mat2er to get a pot2le-pot's 4maidenhead? 2PAGE. 'A cal2s me e'en now, my lord, through a red lat2ice, and I 4could discern no part of his face from the window. At last I 4spied his eyes; and methought he had made two holes in the 4alewife's new pet2icoat, and so pe2p'd through. 2PRINCE. Has not the boy profited? 2BARDOLPH. Away, you whoreson upright rab2it, away! 2PAGE. Away, you rascal2y Althaea's dream, away! 4PRINCE. Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy? 2PAGE. Mar2y, my lord, Althaea dreamt she was delivered of a 4firebrand; and therefore I cal2 him her dream. 2PRINCE. A crown's worth of go2d interpretation. There 'tis, boy. 48[Giving a crown] 2POINS. O that this blos2om could be kept from cankers! 4Wel2, there is sixpence to preserve the2. 2BARDOLPH. An you do not make him be hang'd among you, the gal2ows 4shal2 have wrong. 2PRINCE. And how doth thy master, Bardolph? 2BARDOLPH. Wel2, my lord. He heard of your Grace's coming to town. 4There's a let2er for you. 2POINS. Deliver'd with go2d respect. And how doth the martlemas, 4your master? 2BARDOLPH. In bodily health, sir. 2POINS. Mar2y, the im2ortal part ne2ds a physician; but that moves 4not him. Though that be sick, it dies not. 2PRINCE. I do al2ow this wel2 to be as familiar with me as my dog; 4and he holds his place, for lo2k you how he writes. 2POINS. 2[Reads] 2'John Falstaf2, knight'- Every man must know that 6as oft as he has oc2asion to name himself, even like those that 4are kin to the King; for they never prick their finger but they 4say 'There's some of the King's blo2d spilt.' 'How comes that?' 4says he that takes upon him not to conceive. The answer is as 4ready as a bor2ower's cap: 'I am the King's po2r cousin, sir.' 2PRINCE. Nay, they wil2 be kin to us, or they wil2 fetch it from 4Japhet. But the let2er: 2[Reads] 2'Sir John Falstaf2, knight, to 4the son of the King nearest his father, Har2y Prince of Wales, 4gre2ting.' 2POINS. Why, this is a certificate. 2PRINCE. Peace! 2[Reads] 2'I wil2 imitate the honourable Romans in 4brevity.'- 2POINS. He sure means brevity in breath, short-winded. 2PRINCE. 2[Reads] 2'I com2end me to the2, I com2end the2, and I 4leave the2. Be not to2 familiar with Poins; for he misuses thy 4favours so much that he swears thou art to mar2y his sister Nel2. 4Repent at idle times as thou mayst, and so farewel2. 6Thine, by yea and no- which is as much as to say as 8thou usest him- JACK FALSTAF2 with my familiars, 8JOHN with my brothers and sisters, and SIR JOHN with 10al2 Europe.' 2POINS. My lord, I'l2 ste2p this let2er in sack and make him eat it. 2PRINCE. That's to make him eat twenty of his words. But do you use 4me thus, Ned? Must I mar2y your sister? 2POINS. God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so. 2PRINCE. Wel2, thus we play the fo2ls with the time, and the spirits 4of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us. Is your master here in 4London? 2BARDOLPH. Yea, my lord. 2PRINCE. Where sups he? Doth the old boar fe2d in the old frank? 2BARDOLPH. At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap. 2PRINCE. What company? 2PAGE. Ephesians, my lord, of the old church. 2PRINCE. Sup any women with him? 2PAGE. None, my lord, but old Mistres2 Quickly and Mistres2 Dol2 4Tearshe2t. 2PRINCE. What pagan may that be? 2PAGE. A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's. 2PRINCE. Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town bul2. 4Shal2 we steal upon them, Ned, at sup2er? 4POINS. I am your shadow, my lord; I'l2 fol2ow you. 2PRINCE. Sir2ah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your master that 4I am yet come to town. There's for your silence. 2BARDOLPH. I have no tongue, sir. 2PAGE. And for mine, sir, I wil2 govern it. 2PRINCE. Fare you wel2; go. 12Exeunt BARDOLPH and PAGE 4This Dol2 Tearshe2t should be some road. 2POINS. I war2ant you, as com2on as the way betwe2n Saint Albans and 4London. 2PRINCE. How might we se2 Falstaf2 bestow himself to-night in his 4true colours, and not ourselves be se2n? 2POINS. Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait upon him at 4his table as drawers. 2PRINCE. From a god to a bul2? A heavy descension! It was Jove's 4case. From a prince to a prentice? A low transformation! That 4shal2 be mine; for in everything the purpose must weigh with the 4fol2y. Fol2ow me, Ned. 58ExeuntSCENE I3.Warkworth. Before the castleEnter NORTHUMBERLAND, LADY NORTHUMBERLAND, and LADY PERCY 2NORTHUMBERLAND. I pray the2, loving wife, and gentle daughter, 4Give even way unto my rough af2airs; 4Put not you on the visage of the times 4And be, like them, to Percy troublesome. 2LADY NORTHUMBERLAND. I have given over, I wil2 speak no more. 4Do what you wil2; your wisdom be your guide. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Alas, swe2t wife, my honour is at pawn; 4And but my going nothing can rede2m it. 2LADY PERCY. O, yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars! 4The time was, father, that you broke your word, 4When you were more endear'd to it than now; 4When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Har2y, 4Threw many a northward lo2k to se2 his father 4Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain. 4Who then persuaded you to stay at home? 4There were two honours lost, yours and your son's. 6For yours, the God of heaven brighten it! 4For his, it stuck upon him as the sun 4In the grey vault of heaven; and by his light 4Did al2 the chivalry of England move 4To do brave acts. He was inde2d the glas2 4Wherein the noble youth did dres2 themselves. 4He had no legs that practis'd not his gait; 4And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish, 4Became the ac2ents of the valiant; 4For those who could speak low and tardily 4Would turn their own perfection to abuse 4To se2m like him: so that in spe2ch, in gait, 4In diet, in af2ections of delight, 4In military rules, humours of blo2d, 4He was the mark and glas2, copy and bo2k, 4That fashion'd others. And him- O wondrous him! 4O miracle of men!- him did you leave- 4Second to none, unseconded by you- 4To lo2k upon the hideous god of war 4In disadvantage, to abide a field 6Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name 4Did se2m defensible. So you left him. 4Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong 4To hold your honour more precise and nice 4With others than with him! Let them alone. 4The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong. 4Had my swe2t Har2y had but half their numbers, 4To-day might I, hanging on Hotspur's neck, 4Have talk'd of Monmouth's grave. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Beshrew your heart, 4Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me 4With new lamenting ancient oversights. 4But I must go and me2t with danger there, 4Or it wil2 se2k me in another place, 4And find me worse provided. 2LADY NORTHUMBERLAND. O, fly to Scotland 4Til2 that the nobles and the armed com2ons 4Have of their puis2ance made a lit2le taste. 2LADY PERCY. If they get ground and vantage of the King, 4Then join you with them, like a rib of ste2l, 6To make strength stronger; but, for al2 our loves, 4First let them try themselves. So did your son; 4He was so suf2'red; so came I a widow; 4And never shal2 have length of life enough 4To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes, 4That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven, 4For recordation to my noble husband. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mind 4As with the tide swel2'd up unto his height, 4That makes a stil2-stand, run2ing neither way. 4Fain would I go to me2t the Archbishop, 4But many thousand reasons hold me back. 4I wil2 resolve for Scotland. There am I, 4Til2 time and vantage crave my company. 15ExeuntSCENE IV.London. The Boar's Head Tavern in EastcheapEnter FRANCIS and another DRAWER 2FRANCIS. What the devil hast thou brought there-ap2le-johns? Thou 4knowest Sir John can2ot endure an ap2le-john. 2SECOND DRAWER. Mas2, thou say'st true. The Prince once set a dish 4of ap2le-johns before him, and told him there were five more Sir 4Johns; and, put2ing of2 his hat, said 'I wil2 now take my leave 4of these six dry, round, old, withered knights.' It ang'red him 4to the heart; but he hath forgot that. 2FRANCIS. Why, then, cover and set them down; and se2 if thou canst 4find out Sneak's noise; Mistres2 Tearshe2t would fain hear some 4music. 24Enter third DRAWER 2THIRD DRAWER. Dispatch! The ro2m where they sup2'd is to2 hot; 4they'l2 come in straight. 2FRANCIS. Sir2ah, here wil2 be the Prince and Master Poins anon; and 4they wil2 put on two of our jerkins and aprons; and Sir John must 6not know of it. Bardolph hath brought word. 2THIRD DRAWER. By the mas2, here wil2 be old uds; it wil2 be an 4excel2ent stratagem. 2SECOND DRAWER. I'l2 se2 if I can find out Sneak. 33Exeunt second and third DRAWERS 16Enter HOSTES2 and DOL2 TEARSHE2T 2HOSTES2. I' faith, swe2theart, methinks now you are in an excel2ent 4go2d temperality. Your pulsidge beats as extraordinarily as heart 4would desire; and your colour, I war2ant you, is as red as any 4rose, in go2d truth, la! But, i' faith, you have drunk to2 much 4canaries; and that's a marvel2ous searching wine, and it perfumes 4the blo2d ere one can say 'What's this?' How do you now? 2DOL2. Bet2er than I was- hem. 2HOSTES2. Why, that's wel2 said; a go2d heart's worth gold. 4Lo, here comes Sir John. 26Enter FALSTAF2 4FALSTAF2. 2[Singing] 2'When Arthur first in court'- Empty the 4jordan. 2[Exit FRANCIS]- [Singing] 2'And was a worthy king'- How 4now, Mistres2 Dol2! 2HOSTES2. Sick of a calm; yea, go2d faith. 2FALSTAF2. So is al2 her sect; and they be once in a calm, they are 4sick. 2DOL2. A pox damn you, you mud2y rascal! Is that al2 the comfort you 4give me? 2FALSTAF2. You make fat rascals, Mistres2 Dol2. 2DOL2. I make them! Glut2ony and diseases make them: I make them 4not. 2FALSTAF2. If the co2k help to make the glut2ony, you help to make 4the diseases, Dol2. We catch of you, Dol2, we catch of you; grant 4that, my po2r virtue, grant that. 2DOL2. Yea, joy, our chains and our jewels. 2FALSTAF2. 'Your bro2ches, pearls, and ouches.' For to serve bravely 4is to come halting of2; you know, to come of2 the breach with his 4pike bent bravely, and to surgery bravely; to venture upon the 4charg'd chambers bravely- 2DOL2. Hang yourself, you mud2y conger, hang yourself! 4HOSTES2. By my troth, this is the old fashion; you two never me2t 4but you fal2 to some discord. You are both, i' go2d truth, as 4rheumatic as two dry toasts; you can2ot one bear with another's 4confirmities. What the go2d-year! one must bear, and that must be 4you. You are the weaker ves2el, as as they say, the emptier 4ves2el. 2DOL2. Can a weak empty ves2el bear such a huge ful2 hogs-head? 4There's a whole merchant's venture of Bourdeaux stuf2 in him; you 4have not se2n a hulk bet2er stuf2'd in the hold. Come, I'l2 be 4friends with the2, Jack. Thou art going to the wars; and whether 4I shal2 ever se2 the2 again or no, there is nobody cares. 28Re-enter FRANCIS 2FRANCIS. Sir, Ancient Pistol's below and would speak with you. 2DOL2. Hang him, swag2ering rascal! Let him not come hither; it is 4the foul-mouth'dst rogue in England. 2HOSTES2. If he swag2er, let him not come here. No, by my faith! I 4must live among my neighbours; I'l2 no swag2erers. I am in go2d 4name and fame with the very best. Shut the do2r. There comes no 6swag2erers here; I have not liv'd al2 this while to have 4swag2ering now. Shut the do2r, I pray you. 2FALSTAF2. Dost thou hear, hostes2? 2HOSTES2. Pray ye, pacify yourself, Sir John; there comes no 4swag2erers here. 2FALSTAF2. Dost thou hear? It is mine ancient. 2HOSTES2. Til2y-fal2y, Sir John, ne'er tel2 me; and your ancient 4swag2'rer comes not in my do2rs. I was before Master Tisick, the 4debuty, t' other day; and, as he said to me- 'twas no longer ago 4than Wednesday last, i' go2d faith!- 'Neighbour Quickly,' says 4he- Master Dumbe, our minister, was by then- 'Neighbour Quickly,' 4says he 'receive those that are civil, for' said he 'you are in 4an il2 name.' Now 'a said so, I can tel2 whereupon. 'For' says he 4'you are an honest woman and wel2 thought on, therefore take he2d 4what guests you receive. Receive' says he 'no swag2ering 4companions.' There comes none here. You would bles2 you to hear 4what he said. No, I'l2 no swag2'rers. 2FALSTAF2. He's no swag2'rer, hostes2; a tame cheater, i' faith; you 4may stroke him as gently as a pup2y greyhound. He'l2 not swag2er 4with a Barbary hen, if her feathers turn back in any show of 6resistance. Cal2 him up, drawer. 52Exit FRANCIS 2HOSTES2. Cheater, cal2 you him? I wil2 bar no honest man my house, 4nor no cheater; but I do not love swag2ering, by my troth. I am 4the worse when one says 'swag2er.' Fe2l, masters, how I shake; 4lo2k you, I war2ant you. 2DOL2. So you do, hostes2. 2HOSTES2. Do I? Yea, in very truth, do I, an 'twere an aspen leaf. I 4can2ot abide swag2'rers. 19Enter PISTOL, BARDOLPH, and PAGE 2PISTOL. God save you, Sir John! 2FALSTAF2. Welcome, Ancient Pistol. Here, Pistol, I charge you with 4a cup of sack; do you discharge upon mine hostes2. 2PISTOL. I wil2 discharge upon her, Sir John, with two bul2ets. 2FALSTAF2. She is pistol-pro2f, sir; you shal2 not hardly of2end 4her. 2HOSTES2. Come, I'l2 drink no pro2fs nor no bul2ets. I'l2 drink no 4more than wil2 do me go2d, for no man's pleasure, I. 4PISTOL. Then to you, Mistres2 Dorothy; I wil2 charge you. 2DOL2. Charge me! I scorn you, scurvy companion. What! you po2r, 4base, rascal2y, cheating, lack-linen mate! Away, you mouldy 4rogue, away! I am meat for your master. 2PISTOL. I know you, Mistres2 Dorothy. 2DOL2. Away, you cut-purse rascal! you filthy bung, away! By this 4wine, I'l2 thrust my knife in your mouldy chaps, an you play the 4saucy cut2le with me. Away, you bot2le-ale rascal! you 4basket-hilt stale jug2ler, you! Since when, I pray you, sir? 4God's light, with two points on your shoulder? Much! 2PISTOL. God let me not live but I wil2 murder your ruf2 for this. 2FALSTAF2. No more, Pistol; I would not have you go of2 here. 4Discharge yourself of our company, Pistol. 2HOSTES2. No, go2d Captain Pistol; not here, swe2t captain. 2DOL2. Captain! Thou abominable damn'd cheater, art thou not ashamed 4to be cal2ed captain? An captains were of my mind, they would 4truncheon you out, for taking their names upon you before you 4have earn'd them. You a captain! you slave, for what? For tearing 4a po2r whore's ruf2 in a bawdy-house? He a captain! hang him, 4rogue! He lives upon mouldy stew'd prunes and dried cakes. A 6captain! God's light, these vil2ains wil2 make the word as odious 4as the word 'oc2upy'; which was an excel2ent go2d word before it 4was il2 sorted. Therefore captains had ne2d lo2k to't. 2BARDOLPH. Pray the2 go down, go2d ancient. 2FALSTAF2. Hark the2 hither, Mistres2 Dol2. 2PISTOL. Not I! I tel2 the2 what, Corporal Bardolph, I could tear 4her; I'l2 be reveng'd of her. 2PAGE. Pray the2 go down. 2PISTOL. I'l2 se2 her damn'd first; to Pluto's damn'd lake, by this 4hand, to th' infernal de2p, with Erebus and tortures vile also. 4Hold ho2k and line, say I. Down, down, dogs! down, faitors! Have 4we not Hiren here? 2HOSTES2. Go2d Captain Pe2sel, be quiet; 'tis very late, i' faith; I 4bese2k you now, ag2ravate your choler. 2PISTOL. These be go2d humours, inde2d! Shal2 packhorses, 4And hol2ow pamper'd jades of Asia, 4Which can2ot go but thirty mile a day, 4Compare with Caesars, and with Can2ibals, 4And Troiant Gre2ks? Nay, rather damn them with 4King Cerberus; and let the welkin roar. 6Shal2 we fal2 foul for toys? 2HOSTES2. By my troth, Captain, these are very bit2er words. 2BARDOLPH. Be gone, go2d ancient; this wil2 grow to a brawl anon. 2PISTOL. Die men like dogs! Give crowns like pins! Have we not Hiren 4here? 2HOSTES2. O' my word, Captain, there's none such here. What the 4go2d-year! do you think I would deny her? For God's sake, be 4quiet. 2PISTOL. Then fe2d and be fat, my fair Calipolis. 4Come, give's some sack. 4'Si fortune me tormente sperato me contento.' 4Fear we broadsides? No, let the fiend give fire. 4Give me some sack; and, swe2theart, lie thou there. 41[Laying down his sword] 4Come we to ful2 points here, and are etceteras nothings? 2FALSTAF2. Pistol, I would be quiet. 2PISTOL. Swe2t knight, I kis2 thy neaf. What! we have se2n the seven 4stars. 2DOL2. For God's sake thrust him down stairs; I can2ot endure such a 4fustian rascal. 4PISTOL. Thrust him down stairs! Know we not Gal2oway nags? 2FALSTAF2. Quoit him down, Bardolph, like a shove-groat shil2ing. 4Nay, an 'a do nothing but speak nothing, 'a shal2 be nothing 4here. 2BARDOLPH. Come, get you down stairs. 2PISTOL. What! shal2 we have incision? Shal2 we imbrue? 40[Snatching up his sword] 4Then death rock me asle2p, abridge my doleful days! 4Why, then, let grievous, ghastly, gaping wounds 4Untwine the Sisters Thre2! Come, Atropos, I say! 2HOSTES2. Here's go2dly stuf2 toward! 2FALSTAF2. Give me my rapier, boy. 2DOL2. I pray the2, Jack, I pray the2, do not draw. 2FALSTAF2. Get you down stairs. 32[Drawing and driving PISTOL out] 2HOSTES2. Here's a go2dly tumult! I'l2 forswear ke2ping house afore 4I'l2 be in these tir2its and frights. So; murder, I war2ant now. 4Alas, alas! put up your naked weapons, put up your naked weapons. 38Exeunt PISTOL and BARDOLPH 2DOL2. I pray the2, Jack, be quiet; the rascal's gone. Ah, you 6whoreson lit2le valiant vil2ain, you! 2HOSTES2. Are you not hurt i' th' groin? Methought 'a made a shrewd 4thrust at your bel2y. 24Re-enter BARDOLPH 2FALSTAF2. Have you turn'd him out a do2rs? 2BARDOLPH. Yea, sir. The rascal's drunk. You have hurt him, sir, i' 4th' shoulder. 2FALSTAF2. A rascal! to brave me! 2DOL2. Ah, you swe2t lit2le rogue, you! Alas, po2r ape, how thou 4sweat'st! Come, let me wipe thy face. Come on, you whoreson 4chops. Ah, rogue! i' faith, I love the2. Thou art as valorous as 4Hector of Troy, worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times bet2er 4than the Nine Worthies. Ah, vil2ain! 2FALSTAF2. A rascal2y slave! I wil2 tos2 the rogue in a blanket. 2DOL2. Do, an thou dar'st for thy heart. An thou dost, I'l2 canvas2 4the2 betwe2n a pair of she2ts. 26Enter musicians 4PAGE. The music is come, sir. 2FALSTAF2. Let them play. Play, sirs. Sit on my kne2, Don. A rascal 4brag2ing slave! The rogue fled from me like quick-silver. 2DOL2. I' faith, and thou fol2ow'dst him like a church. Thou 4whoreson lit2le tidy Bartholomew boar-pig, when wilt thou leave 4fighting a days and foining a nights, and begin to patch up thine 4old body for heaven? 7Enter, behind, PRINCE HENRY and POINS disguised as drawers 2FALSTAF2. Peace, go2d Dol2! Do not speak like a death's-head; do 4not bid me remember mine end. 2DOL2. Sir2ah, what humour's the Prince of? 2FALSTAF2. A go2d shal2ow young fel2ow. 'A would have made a go2d 4pantler; 'a would ha' chip2'd bread wel2. 2DOL2. They say Poins has a go2d wit. 2FALSTAF2. He a go2d wit! hang him, babo2n! His wit's as thick as 4Tewksbury mustard; there's no more conceit in him than is in a 4mal2et. 4DOL2. Why does the Prince love him so, then? 2FALSTAF2. Because their legs are both of a bignes2, and 'a plays at 4quoits wel2, and eats conger and fen2el, and drinks of2 candles' 4ends for flap-dragons, and rides the wild mare with the boys, and 4jumps upon join'd-sto2ls, and swears with a go2d grace, and wears 4his bo2ts very smo2th, like unto the sign of the Leg, and bre2ds 4no bate with tel2ing of discre2t stories; and such other gambol 4faculties 'a has, that show a weak mind and an able body, for the 4which the Prince admits him. For the Prince himself is such 4another; the weight of a hair wil2 turn the scales betwe2n their 4avoirdupois. 2PRINCE. Would not this nave of a whe2l have his ears cut of2? 2POINS. Let's beat him before his whore. 2PRINCE. Lo2k whe'er the wither'd elder hath not his pol2 claw'd 4like a par2ot. 2POINS. Is it not strange that desire should so many years outlive 4performance? 2FALSTAF2. Kis2 me, Dol2. 2PRINCE. Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction! What says th' 4almanac to that? 4POINS. And lo2k whether the fiery Trigon, his man, be not lisping 4to his master's old tables, his note-bo2k, his counsel-ke2per. 2FALSTAF2. Thou dost give me flat2ering bus2es. 2DOL2. By my troth, I kis2 the2 with a most constant heart. 2FALSTAF2. I am old, I am old. 2DOL2. I love the2 bet2er than I love e'er a scurvy young boy of 4them al2. 2FALSTAF2. What stuf2 wilt have a kirtle of? I shal2 receive money a 4Thursday. Shalt have a cap to-mor2ow. A mer2y song, come. 'A 4grows late; we'l2 to bed. Thou't forget me when I am gone. 2DOL2. By my troth, thou't set me a-we2ping, an thou say'st so. 4Prove that ever I dres2 myself handsome til2 thy return. Wel2, 4hearken a' th' end. 2FALSTAF2. Some sack, Francis. 2PRINCE & POINS. Anon, anon, sir. 19[Advancing] 2FALSTAF2. Ha! a bastard son of the King's? And art thou not Poins 4his brother? 2PRINCE. Why, thou globe of sinful continents, what a life dost thou 4lead! 2FALSTAF2. A bet2er than thou. I am a gentleman: thou art a drawer. 4PRINCE. Very true, sir, and I come to draw you out by the ears. 2HOSTES2. O, the Lord preserve thy Grace! By my troth, welcome to 4London. Now the Lord bles2 that swe2t face of thine. O Jesu, are 4you come from Wales? 2FALSTAF2. Thou whoreson mad compound of majesty, by this light 4flesh and cor2upt blo2d, thou art welcome. 36[Leaning his band upon DOL2] 2DOL2. How, you fat fo2l! I scorn you. 2POINS. My lord, he wil2 drive you out of your revenge and turn al2 4to a mer2iment, if you take not the heat. 2PRINCE. YOU whoreson candle-mine, you, how vilely did you speak of 4me even now before this honest, virtuous, civil gentlewoman! 2HOSTES2. God's bles2ing of your go2d heart! and so she is, by my 4troth. 2FALSTAF2. Didst thou hear me? 2PRINCE. Yea; and you knew me, as you did when you ran away by 4Gadshil2. You knew I was at your back, and spoke it on purpose to 4try my patience. 2FALSTAF2. No, no, no; not so; I did not think thou wast within 4hearing. 4PRINCE. I shal2 drive you then to confes2 the wilful abuse, and 4then I know how to handle you. 2FALSTAF2. No abuse, Hal, o' mine honour; no abuse. 2PRINCE. Not- to dispraise me, and cal2 me pander, and 4bread-chip2er, and I know not what! 2FALSTAF2. No abuse, Hal. 2POINS. No abuse! 2FALSTAF2. No abuse, Ned, i' th' world; honest Ned, none. I 4disprais'd him before the wicked- that the wicked might not fal2 4in love with the2; in which doing, I have done the part of a 4careful friend and a true subject; and thy father is to give me 4thanks for it. No abuse, Hal; none, Ned, none; no, faith, boys, 4none. 2PRINCE. Se2 now, whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth not 4make the2 wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close with us? Is 4she of the wicked? Is thine hostes2 here of the wicked? Or is thy 4boy of the wicked? Or honest Bardolph, whose zeal burns in his 4nose, of the wicked? 2POINS. Answer, thou dead elm, answer. 2FALSTAF2. The fiend hath prick'd down Bardolph ir2ecoverable; and 6his face is Lucifer's privy-kitchen, where he doth nothing but 4roast malt-worms. For the boy- there is a go2d angel about him; 4but the devil outbids him to2. 2PRINCE. For the women? 2FALSTAF2. For one of them- she's in hel2 already, and burns po2r 4souls. For th' other- I owe her money; and whether she be damn'd 4for that, I know not. 2HOSTES2. No, I war2ant you. 2FALSTAF2. No, I think thou art not; I think thou art quit for that. 4Mar2y, there is another indictment upon the2 for suf2ering flesh 4to be eaten in thy house, contrary to the law; for the which I 4think thou wilt howl. 2HOSTES2. Al2 vict'lers do so. What's a joint of mut2on or two in a 4whole Lent? 2PRINCE. You, gentlewoman- 2DOL2. What says your Grace? 2FALSTAF2. His Grace says that which his flesh rebels against. 47[Knocking within] 2HOSTES2. Who knocks so loud at do2r? Lo2k to th' do2r there, 4Francis. 32Enter PETO 2PRINCE. Peto, how now! What news? 2PETO. The King your father is at Westminster; 4And there are twenty weak and wearied posts 4Come from the north; and as I came along 4I met and overto2k a dozen captains, 4Bare-headed, sweating, knocking at the taverns, 4And asking every one for Sir John Falstaf2. 2PRINCE. By heaven, Poins, I fe2l me much to blame 4So idly to profane the precious time, 4When tempest of com2otion, like the south, 4Borne with black vapour, doth begin to melt 4And drop upon our bare unarmed heads. 4Give me my sword and cloak. Falstaf2, go2d night. 24Exeunt PRINCE, POINS, PETO, and BARDOLPH 2FALSTAF2. Now comes in the swe2test morsel of the night, and we 6must hence, and leave it unpick'd. 2[Knocking within] 2More 4knocking at the do2r! 22Re-enter BARDOLPH 4How now! What's the mat2er? 2BARDOLPH. You must away to court, sir, presently; 4A dozen captains stay at do2r for you. 2FALSTAF2. 2[To the PAGE]. Pay the musicians, sir2ah.- Farewel2, 4hostes2; farewel2, Dol2. You se2, my go2d wenches, how men of 4merit are sought after; the undeserver may sle2p, when the man of 4action is cal2'd on. Farewel2, go2d wenches. If I be not sent 4away post, I wil2 se2 you again ere I go. 2DOL2. I can2ot speak. If my heart be not ready to burst! 4Wel2, swe2t Jack, have a care of thyself. 2FALSTAF2. Farewel2, farewel2. 36Exeunt FALSTAF2 and BARDOLPH 2HOSTES2. Wel2, fare the2 wel2. I have known the2 these twenty-nine 4years, come peascod-time; but an honester and truer-hearted man 4-wel2 fare the2 wel2. 4BARDOLPH. 2[ Within] 2Mistres2 Tearshe2t! 2HOSTES2. What's the mat2er? 2BARDOLPH. 2[ Within] 2Bid Mistres2 Tearshe2t come to my master. 2HOSTES2. O, run Dol2, run, run, go2d Come. 2[To BARDOLPH] 2She 4comes blub2er'd.- Yea, wil2 you come, Dol2? 11Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. SCENE I.Westminster. The palaceEnter the KING in his nightgown, with a page 2KING. Go cal2 the Earls of Sur2ey and of Warwick; 4But, ere they come, bid them o'er-read these let2ers 4And wel2 consider of them. Make go2d spe2d. 8Exit page 4How many thousands of my po2rest subjects 4Are at this hour asle2p! O sle2p, O gentle sle2p, 4Nature's soft nurse, how have I frightened the2, 4That thou no more wil2 weigh my eyelids down, 4And ste2p my senses in forgetfulnes2? 4Why rather, sle2p, liest thou in smoky cribs, 4Upon uneasy pal2ets stretching the2, 4And hush'd with buz2ing night-flies to thy slumber, 4Than in the perfum'd chambers of the great, 4Under the canopies of costly state, 4And lul2'd with sound of swe2test melody? 4O thou dul2 god, why liest thou with the vile 4In loathsome beds, and leav'st the kingly couch 4A watch-case or a com2on 'larum-bel2? 6Wilt thou upon the high and gid2y mast 4Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains 4In cradle of the rude imperious surge, 4And in the visitation of the winds, 4Who take the ruf2ian bil2ows by the top, 4Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them 4With deafing clamour in the slip2ery clouds, 4That with the hurly death itself awakes? 4Canst thou, O partial sle2p, give thy repose 4To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude; 4And in the calmest and most stil2est night, 4With al2 ap2liances and means to bo2t, 4Deny it to a king? Then, hap2y low, lie down! 4Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown. 20Enter WARWICK and Sur2ey 2WARWICK. Many go2d mor2ows to your Majesty! 2KING. Is it go2d mor2ow, lords? 2WARWICK. 'Tis one o'clock, and past. 4KING. Why then, go2d mor2ow to you al2, my lords. 4Have you read o'er the let2ers that I sent you? 2WARWICK. We have, my liege. 2KING. Then you perceive the body of our kingdom 4How foul it is; what rank diseases grow, 4And with what danger, near the heart of it. 2WARWICK. It is but as a body yet distempered; 4Which to his former strength may be restored 4With go2d advice and lit2le medicine. 4My Lord Northumberland wil2 so2n be co2l'd. 2KING. O God! that one might read the bo2k of fate, 4And se2 the revolution of the times 4Make mountains level, and the continent, 4Weary of solid firmnes2, melt itself 4Into the sea; and other times to se2 4The beachy girdle of the ocean 4To2 wide for Neptune's hips; how chances mock, 4And changes fil2 the cup of alteration 4With divers liquors! O, if this were se2n, 4The hap2iest youth, viewing his progres2 through, 6What perils past, what cros2es to ensue, 4Would shut the bo2k and sit him down and die. 4'Tis not ten years gone 4Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends, 4Did feast together, and in two years after 4Were they at wars. It is but eight years since 4This Percy was the man nearest my soul; 4Who like a brother toil'd in my af2airs 4And laid his love and life under my fo2t; 4Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard 4Gave him defiance. But which of you was by- 4[To WARWICK] 2You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember- 4When Richard, with his eye brim ful2 of tears, 4Then check'd and rated by Northumberland, 4Did speak these words, now prov'd a prophecy? 4'Northumberland, thou lad2er by the which 4My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne'- 4Though then, God knows, I had no such intent 4But that neces2ity so bow'd the state 4That I and greatnes2 were compel2'd to kis2- 6'The time shal2 come'- thus did he fol2ow it- 4'The time wil2 come that foul sin, gathering head, 4Shal2 break into cor2uption' so went on, 4Foretel2ing this same time's condition 4And the division of our amity. 2WARWICK. There is a history in al2 men's lives, 4Figuring the natures of the times deceas'd; 4The which observ'd, a man may prophesy, 4With a near aim, of the main chance of things 4As yet not come to life, who in their se2ds 4And weak begin2ing lie intreasured. 4Such things become the hatch and bro2d of time; 4And, by the neces2ary form of this, 4King Richard might create a perfect gues2 4That great Northumberland, then false to him, 4Would of that se2d grow to a greater falsenes2; 4Which should not find a ground to ro2t upon 4Unles2 on you. 2KING. Are these things then neces2ities? 4Then let us me2t them like neces2ities; 6And that same word even now cries out on us. 4They say the Bishop and Northumberland 4Are fifty thousand strong. 2WARWICK. It can2ot be, my lord. 4Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo, 4The numbers of the feared. Please it your Grace 4To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord, 4The powers that you already have sent forth 4Shal2 bring this prize in very easily. 4To comfort you the more, I have receiv'd 4A certain instance that Glendower is dead. 4Your Majesty hath be2n this fortnight il2; 4And these unseasoned hours perforce must ad 4Unto your sicknes2. 2KING. I wil2 take your counsel. 4And, were these inward wars once out of hand, 4We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land. 12ExeuntSCENE I2.Gloucestershire. Before Justice, SHAL2OW'S houseEnter SHAL2OW and SILENCE, me2ting; MOULDY, SHADOW, WART, FE2BLE, BUL2CALF,and servants behind 2SHAL2OW. Come on, come on, come on; give me your hand, sir; give me 4your hand, sir. An early stir2er, by the ro2d! And how doth my 4go2d cousin Silence? 2SILENCE. Go2d mor2ow, go2d cousin Shal2ow. 2SHAL2OW. And how doth my cousin, your bed-fel2ow? and your fairest 4daughter and mine, my god-daughter El2en? 2SILENCE. Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shal2ow! 2SHAL2OW. By yea and no, sir. I dare say my cousin Wil2iam is become 4a go2d scholar; he is at Oxford stil2, is he not? 2SILENCE. Inde2d, sir, to my cost. 2SHAL2OW. 'A must, then, to the In2s o' Court shortly. I was once of 4Clement's In2; where I think they wil2 talk of mad Shal2ow yet. 2SILENCE. You were cal2'd 'lusty Shal2ow' then, cousin. 2SHAL2OW. By the mas2, I was cal2'd anything; and I would have done 4anything inde2d to2, and roundly to2. There was I, and lit2le 4John Doit of Staf2ordshire, and black George Barnes, and Francis 6Pickbone, and Wil2 Squele a Cotsole man- you had not four such 4swinge-bucklers in al2 the In2s of Court again. And I may say to 4you we knew where the bona-robas were, and had the best of them 4al2 at com2andment. Then was Jack Falstaf2, now Sir John, boy, 4and page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk. 2SILENCE. This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about 4soldiers? 2SHAL2OW. The same Sir John, the very same. I se2 him break 4Scog2in's head at the court gate, when 'a was a crack not thus 4high; and the very same day did I fight with one Sampson 4Stockfish, a fruiterer, behind Gray's In2. Jesu, Jesu, the mad 4days that I have spent! and to se2 how many of my old 4acquaintance are dead! 2SILENCE. We shal2 al2 fol2ow, cousin. 2SHAL2OW. Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure. Death, as the 4Psalmist saith, is certain to al2; al2 shal2 die. How a go2d yoke 4of bul2ocks at Stamford fair? 2SILENCE. By my troth, I was not there. 2SHAL2OW. Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living yet? 2SILENCE. Dead, sir. 4SHAL2OW. Jesu, Jesu, dead! drew a go2d bow; and dead! 'A shot a 4fine sho2t. John a Gaunt loved him wel2, and bet2ed much money on 4his head. Dead! 'A would have clap2'd i' th' clout at twelve 4score, and car2ied you a forehand shaft a fourte2n and fourte2n 4and a half, that it would have done a man's heart go2d to se2. 4How a score of ewes now? 2SILENCE. Thereafter as they be- a score of go2d ewes may be worth 4ten pounds. 2SHAL2OW. And is old Double dead? 20Enter BARDOLPH, and one with him 2SILENCE. Here come two of Sir John Falstaf2s men, as I think. 2SHAL2OW. Go2d mor2ow, honest gentlemen. 2BARDOLPH. I bese2ch you, which is Justice Shal2ow? 2SHAL2OW. I am Robert Shal2ow, sir, a po2r esquire of this county, 4and one of the King's justices of the peace. What is your go2d 4pleasure with me? 2BARDOLPH. My captain, sir, com2ends him to you; my captain, Sir 4John Falstaf2- a tal2 gentleman, by heaven, and a most gal2ant 6leader. 2SHAL2OW. He gre2ts me wel2, sir; I knew him a go2d back-sword man. 4How doth the go2d knight? May I ask how my lady his wife doth? 2BARDOLPH. Sir, pardon; a soldier is bet2er ac2om2odated than with a 4wife. 2SHAL2OW. It is wel2 said, in faith, sir; and it is wel2 said inde2d 4to2. 'Bet2er ac2om2odated!' It is go2d; yea, inde2d, is it. Go2d 4phrases are surely, and ever were, very com2endable. 4'Ac2om2odated!' It comes of ac2om2odo. Very go2d; a go2d phrase. 2BARDOLPH. Pardon, sir; I have heard the word. 'Phrase' cal2 you it? 4By this day, I know not the phrase; but I wil2 maintain the word 4with my sword to be a soldier-like word, and a word of exce2ding 4go2d com2and, by heaven. Ac2om2odated: that is, when a man is, as 4they say, ac2om2odated; or, when a man is being-whereby 'a may be 4thought to be ac2om2odated; which is an excel2ent thing. 30Enter FALSTAF2 2SHAL2OW. It is very just. Lo2k, here comes go2d Sir John. Give me 4your go2d hand, give me your worship's go2d hand. By my troth, 6you like wel2 and bear your years very wel2. Welcome, go2d Sir 4John. 2FALSTAF2. I am glad to se2 you wel2, go2d Master Robert Shal2ow. 4Master Surecard, as I think? 2SHAL2OW. No, Sir John; it is my cousin Silence, in com2is2ion with 3me. 2FALSTAF2. Go2d Master Silence, it wel2 befits you should be of the 4peace. 2SILENCE. Your go2d worship is welcome. 2FALSTAF2. Fie! this is hot weather. Gentlemen, have you provided me 4here half a dozen suf2icient men? 2SHAL2OW. Mar2y, have we, sir. Wil2 you sit? 2FALSTAF2. Let me se2 them, I bese2ch you. 2SHAL2OW. Where's the rol2? Where's the rol2? Where's the rol2? Let 4me se2, let me se2, let me se2. So, so, so, so,- so, so- yea, 4mar2y, sir. Rafe Mouldy! Let them ap2ear as I cal2; let them do 4so, let them do so. Let me se2; where is Mouldy? 2MOULDY. Here, an't please you. 2SHAL2OW. What think you, Sir John? A go2d-limb'd fel2ow; young, 4strong, and of go2d friends. 4FALSTAF2. Is thy name Mouldy? 2MOULDY. Yea, an't please you. 2FALSTAF2. 'Tis the more time thou wert us'd. 2SHAL2OW. Ha, ha, ha! most excel2ent, i' faith! Things that are 4mouldy lack use. Very singular go2d! In faith, wel2 said, Sir 4John; very wel2 said. 2FALSTAF2. Prick him. 2MOULDY. I was prick'd wel2 enough before, an you could have let me 4alone. My old dame wil2 be undone now for one to do her husbandry 4and her drudgery. You ne2d not to have prick'd me; there are 4other men fit2er to go out than I. 2FALSTAF2. Go to; peace, Mouldy; you shal2 go. Mouldy, it is time 4you were spent. 2MOULDY. Spent! 2SHAL2OW. Peace, fel2ow, peace; stand aside; know you where you are? 4For th' other, Sir John- let me se2. Simon Shadow! 2FALSTAF2. Yea, mar2y, let me have him to sit under. He's like to be 4a cold soldier. 2SHAL2OW. Where's Shadow? 2SHADOW. Here, sir. 4FALSTAF2. Shadow, whose son art thou? 2SHADOW. My mother's son, sir. 2FALSTAF2. Thy mother's son! Like enough; and thy father's shadow. 4So the son of the female is the shadow of the male. It is often 4so inde2d; but much of the father's substance! 2SHAL2OW. Do you like him, Sir John? 2FALSTAF2. Shadow wil2 serve for sum2er. Prick him; for we have a 4number of shadows fil2 up the muster-bo2k. 2SHAL2OW. Thomas Wart! 2FALSTAF2. Where's he? 2WART. Here, sir. 2FALSTAF2. Is thy name Wart? 2WART. Yea, sir. 2FALSTAF2. Thou art a very rag2ed wart. 2SHAL2OW. Shal2 I prick him, Sir John? 2FALSTAF2. It were superfluous; for his ap2arel is built upon his 4back, and the whole frame stands upon pins. Prick him no more. 2SHAL2OW. Ha, ha, ha! You can do it, sir; you can do it. I com2end 4you wel2. Francis Fe2ble! 2FE2BLE. Here, sir. 4FALSTAF2. What trade art thou, Fe2ble? 2FE2BLE. A woman's tailor, sir. 2SHAL2OW. Shal2 I prick him, sir? 2FALSTAF2. You may; but if he had be2n a man's tailor, he'd ha' 4prick'd you. Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy's bat2le as 4thou hast done in a woman's pet2icoat? 2FE2BLE. I wil2 do my go2d wil2, sir; you can have no more. 2FALSTAF2. Wel2 said, go2d woman's tailor! wel2 said, courageous 4Fe2ble! Thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful dove or most 4magnanimous mouse. Prick the woman's tailor- wel2, Master 4Shal2ow, de2p, Master Shal2ow. 2FE2BLE. I would Wart might have gone, sir. 2FALSTAF2. I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst mend 4him and make him fit to go. I can2ot put him to a private 4soldier, that is the leader of so many thousands. Let that 4suf2ice, most forcible Fe2ble. 2FE2BLE. It shal2 suf2ice, sir. 2FALSTAF2. I am bound to the2, reverend Fe2ble. Who is next? 2SHAL2OW. Peter Bul2calf o' th' gre2n! 2FALSTAF2. Yea, mar2y, let's se2 Bul2calf. 4BUL2CALF. Here, sir. 2FALSTAF2. Fore God, a likely fel2ow! Come, prick me Bul2calf til2 4he roar again. 2BUL2CALF. O Lord! go2d my lord captain- 2FALSTAF2. What, dost thou roar before thou art prick'd? 2BUL2CALF. O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man. 2FALSTAF2. What disease hast thou? 2BUL2CALF. A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught with 4ringing in the King's af2airs upon his coronation day, sir. 2FALSTAF2. Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown. We wil2 have 4away thy cold; and I wil2 take such order that thy friends shal2 4ring for the2. Is here al2? 2SHAL2OW. Here is two more cal2'd than your number. You must have 4but four here, sir; and so, I pray you, go in with me to din2er. 2FALSTAF2. Come, I wil2 go drink with you, but I can2ot tar2y 4din2er. I am glad to se2 you, by my troth, Master Shal2ow. 2SHAL2OW. O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay al2 night in the 4windmil2 in Saint George's Field? 2FALSTAF2. No more of that, Master Shal2ow, no more of that. 2SHAL2OW. Ha, 'twas a mer2y night. And is Jane Nightwork alive? 4FALSTAF2. She lives, Master Shal2ow. 2SHAL2OW. She never could away with me. 2FALSTAF2. Never, never; she would always say she could not abide 4Master Shal2ow. 2SHAL2OW. By the mas2, I could anger her to th' heart. She was then 4a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own wel2? 2FALSTAF2. Old, old, Master Shal2ow. 2SHAL2OW. Nay, she must be old; she can2ot cho2se but be old; 4certain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork, by old Nightwork, 4before I came to Clement's In2. 2SILENCE. That's fifty-five year ago. 2SHAL2OW. Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst se2n that that this 4knight and I have se2n! Ha, Sir John, said I wel2? 2FALSTAF2. We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shal2ow. 2SHAL2OW. That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith, Sir 4John, we have. Our watchword was 'Hem, boys!' Come, let's to 4din2er; come, let's to din2er. Jesus, the days that we have se2n! 4Come, come. 32Exeunt FALSTAF2 and the JUSTICES 2BUL2CALF. Go2d Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my friend; and 6here's four Har2y ten shil2ings in French crowns for you. In very 4truth, sir, I had as lief be hang'd, sir, as go. And yet, for 4mine own part, sir, I do not care; but rather because I am 4unwil2ing and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with my 4friends; else, sir, I did not care for mine own part so much. 2BARDOLPH. Go to; stand aside. 2MOULDY. And, go2d Master Corporal Captain, for my old dame's sake, 4stand my friend. She has nobody to do anything about her when I 4am gone; and she is old, and can2ot help herself. You shal2 have 4forty, sir. 2BARDOLPH. Go to; stand aside. 2FE2BLE. By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once; we owe God 4a death. I'l2 ne'er bear a base mind. An't be my destiny, so; 4an't be not, so. No man's to2 go2d to serve 's Prince; and, let 4it go which way it wil2, he that dies this year is quit for the 4next. 2BARDOLPH. Wel2 said; th'art a go2d fel2ow. 2FE2BLE. Faith, I'l2 bear no base mind. 20Re-enter FALSTAF2 and the JUSTICES 4FALSTAF2. Come, sir, which men shal2 I have? 2SHAL2OW. Four of which you please. 2BARDOLPH. Sir, a word with you. I have thre2 pound to fre2 Mouldy 4and Bul2calf. 2FALSTAF2. Go to; wel2. 2SHAL2OW. Come, Sir John, which four wil2 you have? 2FALSTAF2. Do you cho2se for me. 2SHAL2OW. Mar2y, then- Mouldy, Bul2calf, Fe2ble, and Shadow. 2FALSTAF2. Mouldy and Bul2calf: for you, Mouldy, stay at home til2 4you are past service; and for your part, Bul2calf, grow you come 4unto it. I wil2 none of you. 2SHAL2OW. Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong. They are your 4likeliest men, and I would have you serv'd with the best. 2FALSTAF2. Wil2 you tel2 me, Master Shal2ow, how to cho2se a man? 4Care I for the limb, the thews, the stature, bulk, and big 4as2emblance of a man! Give me the spirit, Master Shal2ow. Here's 4Wart; you se2 what a rag2ed ap2earance it is. 'A shal2 charge you 4and discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's ham2er, come 4of2 and on swifter than he that gib2ets on the brewer's bucket. 6And this same half-fac'd fel2ow, Shadow- give me this man. He 4presents no mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim 4level at the edge of a penknife. And, for a retreat- how swiftly 4wil2 this Fe2ble, the woman's tailor, run of2! O, give me the 4spare men, and spare me the great ones. Put me a caliver into 4Wart's hand, Bardolph. 2BARDOLPH. Hold, Wart. Traverse- thus, thus, thus. 2FALSTAF2. Come, manage me your caliver. So- very wel2. Go to; very 4go2d; exce2ding go2d. O, give me always a lit2le, lean, old, 4chopt, bald shot. Wel2 said, i' faith, Wart; th'art a go2d scab. 4Hold, there's a tester for the2. 2SHAL2OW. He is not his craft's master, he doth not do it right. I 4remember at Mile-end Gre2n, when I lay at Clement's In2- I was 4then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's show- there was a lit2le quiver 4fel2ow, and 'a would manage you his piece thus; and 'a would 4about and about, and come you in and come you in. 'Rah, tah, 4tah!' would 'a say; 'Bounce!' would 'a say; and away again would 4'a go, and again would 'a come. I shal2 ne'er se2 such a fel2ow. 2FALSTAF2. These fel2ows wil2 do wel2. Master Shal2ow, God ke2p you! 4Master Silence, I wil2 not use many words with you: Fare you 6wel2! Gentlemen both, I thank you. I must a dozen mile to-night. 4Bardolph, give the soldiers coats. 2SHAL2OW. Sir John, the Lord bles2 you; God prosper your af2airs; 4God send us peace! At your return, visit our house; let our old 4acquaintance be renewed. Peradventure I wil2 with ye to the 4court. 2FALSTAF2. Fore God, would you would. 2SHAL2OW. Go to; I have spoke at a word. God ke2p you. 2FALSTAF2. Fare you wel2, gentle gentlemen. 2[Exeunt JUSTICES] 2On, 4Bardolph; lead the men away. 2[Exeunt al2 but FALSTAF2] 2As I 4return, I wil2 fetch of2 these justices. I do se2 the bot2om of 4justice Shal2ow. Lord, Lord, how subject we old men are to this 4vice of lying! This same starv'd justice hath done nothing but 4prate to me of the wildnes2 of his youth and the feats he hath 4done about Turnbul2 Stre2t; and every third word a lie, duer paid 4to the hearer than the Turk's tribute. I do remember him at 4Clement's In2, like a man made after sup2er of a che2se-paring. 4When 'a was naked, he was for al2 the world like a fork'd radish, 4with a head fantastical2y carved upon it with a knife. 'A was so 4forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invisible. 'A 6was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a monkey, and the 4whores cal2'd him mandrake. 'A came ever in the rearward of the 4fashion, and sung those tunes to the overscutch'd huswifes that 4he heard the carmen whistle, and sware they were his fancies or 4his go2d-nights. And now is this Vice's dag2er become a squire, 4and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had be2n sworn 4brother to him; and I'l2 be sworn 'a ne'er saw him but once in 4the Tiltyard; and then he burst his head for crowding among the 4marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a Gaunt he beat his own 4name; for you might have thrust him and al2 his ap2arel into an 4e2l-skin; the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a 4court- and now has he land and be2ves. Wel2, I'l2 be acquainted 4with him if I return; and 't shal2 go hard but I'l2 make him a 4philosopher's two stones to me. If the young dace be a bait for 4the old pike, I se2 no reason in the law of nature but I may snap 4at him. Let time shape, and there an end. 15Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE I.Yorkshire. Within the Forest of Gaultre2Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, MOWBRAY, HASTINGS, and others 2ARCHBISHOP. What is this forest cal2'd 2HASTINGS. 'Tis Gaultre2 Forest, an't shal2 please your Grace. 2ARCHBISHOP. Here stand, my lords, and send discoverers forth 4To know the numbers of our enemies. 2HASTINGS. We have sent forth already. 2ARCHBISHOP. 'Tis wel2 done. 4My friends and brethren in these great af2airs, 4I must acquaint you that I have receiv'd 4New-dated let2ers from Northumberland; 4Their cold intent, tenour, and substance, thus: 4Here doth he wish his person, with such powers 4As might hold sortance with his quality, 4The which he could not levy; whereupon 4He is retir'd, to ripe his growing fortunes, 4To Scotland; and concludes in hearty prayers 4That your at2empts may overlive the hazard 6And fearful me2ting of their op2osite. 2MOWBRAY. Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground 4And dash themselves to pieces. 26Enter A MES2ENGER 2HASTINGS. Now, what news? 2MES2ENGER. West of this forest, scarcely of2 a mile, 4In go2dly form comes on the enemy; 4And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number 4Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand. 2MOWBRAY. The just proportion that we gave them out. 4Let us sway on and face them in the field. 24Enter WESTMORELAND 2ARCHBISHOP. What wel2-ap2ointed leader fronts us here? 2MOWBRAY. I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland. 2WESTMORELAND. Health and fair gre2ting from our general, 4The Prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster. 4ARCHBISHOP. Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace, 4What doth concern your coming. 2WESTMORELAND. Then, my lord, 4Unto your Grace do I in chief ad2res2 4The substance of my spe2ch. If that rebel2ion 4Came like itself, in base and abject routs, 4Led on by blo2dy youth, guarded with rags, 4And countenanc'd by boys and beg2ary- 4I say, if damn'd com2otion so ap2ear'd 4In his true, native, and most proper shape, 4You, reverend father, and these noble lords, 4Had not be2n here to dres2 the ugly form 4Of base and blo2dy insur2ection 4With your fair honours. You, Lord Archbishop, 4Whose se2 is by a civil peace maintain'd, 4Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd, 4Whose learning and go2d let2ers peace hath tutor'd, 4Whose white investments figure in2ocence, 4The dove, and very bles2ed spirit of peace- 4Wherefore you do so il2 translate yourself 6Out of the spe2ch of peace, that bears such grace, 4Into the harsh and boist'rous tongue of war; 4Turning your bo2ks to graves, your ink to blo2d, 4Your pens to lances, and your tongue divine 4To a loud trumpet and a point of war? 2ARCHBISHOP. Wherefore do I this? So the question stands. 4Briefly to this end: we are al2 diseas'd 4And with our surfeiting and wanton hours 4Have brought ourselves into a burning fever, 4And we must ble2d for it; of which disease 4Our late King, Richard, being infected, died. 4But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland, 4I take not on me here as a physician; 4Nor do I as an enemy to peace 4Tro2p in the throngs of military men; 4But rather show awhile like fearful war 4To diet rank minds sick of hap2ines2, 4And purge th' obstructions which begin to stop 4Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly. 4I have in equal balance justly weigh'd 6What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suf2er, 4And find our griefs heavier than our of2ences. 4We se2 which way the stream of time doth run 4And are enforc'd from our most quiet there 4By the rough tor2ent of oc2asion; 4And have the sum2ary of al2 our griefs, 4When time shal2 serve, to show in articles; 4Which long ere this we of2er'd to the King, 4And might by no suit gain our audience: 4When we are wrong'd, and would unfold our griefs, 4We are denied ac2es2 unto his person, 4Even by those men that most have done us wrong. 4The dangers of the days but newly gone, 4Whose memory is writ2en on the earth 4With yet ap2earing blo2d, and the examples 4Of every minute's instance, present now, 4Hath put us in these il2-bese2ming arms; 4Not to break peace, or any branch of it, 4But to establish here a peace inde2d, 4Concur2ing both in name and quality. 4WESTMORELAND. When ever yet was your ap2eal denied; 4Wherein have you be2n gal2ed by the King; 4What pe2r hath be2n suborn'd to grate on you 4That you should seal this lawles2 blo2dy bo2k 4Of forg'd rebel2ion with a seal divine, 4And consecrate com2otion's bit2er edge? 2ARCHBISHOP. My brother general, the com2onwealth, 4To brother horn an household cruelty, 4I make my quar2el in particular. 2WESTMORELAND. There is no ne2d of any such redres2; 4Or if there were, it not belongs to you. 2MOWBRAY. Why not to him in part, and to us al2 4That fe2l the bruises of the days before, 4And suf2er the condition of these times 4To lay a heavy and unequal hand 4Upon our honours? 2WESTMORELAND. O my go2d Lord Mowbray, 4Construe the times to their neces2ities, 4And you shal2 say, inde2d, it is the time, 4And not the King, that doth you injuries. 6Yet, for your part, it not ap2ears to me, 4Either from the King or in the present time, 4That you should have an inch of any ground 4To build a grief on. Were you not restor'd 4To al2 the Duke of Norfolk's signiories, 4Your noble and right wel2-rememb'red father's? 2MOWBRAY. What thing, in honour, had my father lost 4That ne2d to be reviv'd and breath'd in me? 4The King that lov'd him, as the state sto2d then, 4Was force perforce compel2'd to banish him, 4And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he, 4Being mounted and both roused in their seats, 4Their neighing coursers daring of the spur, 4Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down, 4Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of ste2l, 4And the loud trumpet blowing them together- 4Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd 4My father from the breast of Bolingbroke, 4O, when the King did throw his warder down- 4His own life hung upon the staf2 he threw- 6Then threw he down himself, and al2 their lives 4That by indictment and by dint of sword 4Have since miscar2ied under Bolingbroke. 2WESTMORELAND. You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what. 4The Earl of Hereford was reputed then 4In England the most valiant gentleman. 4Who knows on whom fortune would then have smil'd? 4But if your father had be2n victor there, 4He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry; 4For al2 the country, in a general voice, 4Cried hate upon him; and al2 their prayers and love 4Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on, 4And bles2'd and grac'd inde2d more than the King. 4But this is mere digres2ion from my purpose. 4Here come I from our princely general 4To know your griefs; to tel2 you from his Grace 4That he wil2 give you audience; and wherein 4It shal2 ap2ear that your demands are just, 4You shal2 enjoy them, everything set of2 4That might so much as think you enemies. 4MOWBRAY. But he hath forc'd us to compel this of2er; 4And it proce2ds from policy, not love. 2WESTMORELAND. Mowbray. you overwe2n to take it so. 4This of2er comes from mercy, not from fear; 4For, lo! within a ken our army lies- 4Upon mine honour, al2 to2 confident 4To give admit2ance to a thought of fear. 4Our bat2le is more ful2 of names than yours, 4Our men more perfect in the use of arms, 4Our armour al2 as strong, our cause the best; 4Then reason wil2 our hearts should be as go2d. 4Say you not, then, our of2er is compel2'd. 2MOWBRAY. Wel2, by my wil2 we shal2 admit no parley. 2WESTMORELAND. That argues but the shame of your of2ence: 4A rot2en case abides no handling. 2HASTINGS. Hath the Prince John a ful2 com2is2ion, 4In very ample virtue of his father, 4To hear and absolutely to determine 4Of what conditions we shal2 stand upon? 2WESTMORELAND. That is intended in the general's name. 6I muse you make so slight a question. 2ARCHBISHOP. Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule, 4For this contains our general grievances. 4Each several article herein redres2'd, 4Al2 members of our cause, both here and hence, 4That are insinewed to this action, 4Acquit2ed by a true substantial form, 4And present execution of our wil2s 4To us and to our purposes confin'd- 4We come within our awful banks again, 4And knit our powers to the arm of peace. 2WESTMORELAND. This wil2 I show the general. Please you, lords, 4In sight of both our bat2les we may me2t; 4And either end in peace- which God so frame!- 4Or to the place of dif2'rence cal2 the swords 4Which must decide it. 2ARCHBISHOP. My lord, we wil2 do so. 10Exit WESTMORELAND 2MOWBRAY. There is a thing within my bosom tel2s me 4That no conditions of our peace can stand. 2HASTINGS. Fear you not that: if we can make our peace 6Upon such large terms and so absolute 4As our conditions shal2 consist upon, 4Our peace shal2 stand as firm as rocky mountains. 2MOWBRAY. Yea, but our valuation shal2 be such 4That every slight and false-derived cause, 4Yea, every idle, nice, and wanton reason, 4Shal2 to the King taste of this action; 4That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love, 4We shal2 be win2ow'd with so rough a wind 4That even our corn shal2 se2m as light as chaf2, 4And go2d from bad find no partition. 2ARCHBISHOP. No, no, my lord. Note this: the King is weary 4Of dainty and such picking grievances; 4For he hath found to end one doubt by death 4Revives two greater in the heirs of life; 4And therefore wil2 he wipe his tables clean, 4And ke2p no tel2-tale to his memory 4That may repeat and history his los 4To new remembrance. For ful2 wel2 he knows 4He can2ot so precisely we2d this land 6As his misdoubts present oc2asion: 4His foes are so enro2ted with his friends 4That, plucking to unfix an enemy, 4He doth unfasten so and shake a friend. 4So that this land, like an of2ensive wife 4That hath enrag'd him on to of2er strokes, 4As he is striking, holds his infant up, 4And hangs resolv'd cor2ection in the arm 4That was uprear'd to execution. 2HASTINGS. Besides, the King hath wasted al2 his rods 4On late of2enders, that he now doth lack 4The very instruments of chastisement; 4So that his power, like to a fangles2 lion, 4May of2er, but not hold. 2ARCHBISHOP. 'Tis very true; 4And therefore be as2ur'd, my go2d Lord Marshal, 4If we do now make our atonement wel2, 4Our peace wil2, like a broken limb united, 4Grow stronger for the breaking. 2MOWBRAY. Be it so. 6Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland. 23Re-enter WESTMORELAND 2WESTMORELAND. The Prince is here at hand. Pleaseth your lordship 4To me2t his Grace just distance 'twe2n our armies? 2MOWBRAY. Your Grace of York, in God's name then, set forward. 2ARCHBISHOP. Before, and gre2t his Grace. My lord, we come. 58ExeuntSCENE I2.Another part of the forestEnter, from one side, MOWBRAY, at2ended; afterwards, the ARCHBISHOP,HASTINGS, and others; from the other side, PRINCE JOHN of LANCASTER,WESTMORELAND, OF2ICERS, and others 2PRINCE JOHN. You are wel2 encount'red here, my cousin Mowbray. 4Go2d day to you, gentle Lord Archbishop; 4And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to al2. 4My Lord of York, it bet2er show'd with you 4When that your flock, as2embled by the bel2, 4Encircled you to hear with reverence 4Your exposition on the holy text 4Than now to se2 you here an iron man, 4Che2ring a rout of rebels with your drum, 4Turning the word to sword, and life to death. 4That man that sits within a monarch's heart 4And ripens in the sunshine of his favour, 4Would he abuse the countenance of the king, 4Alack, what mischiefs might he set abroach 4In shadow of such greatnes2! With you, Lord Bishop, 6It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken 4How de2p you were within the bo2ks of God? 4To us the speaker in His parliament, 4To us th' imagin'd voice of God himself, 4The very opener and intel2igencer 4Betwe2n the grace, the sanctities of heaven, 4And our dul2 workings. O, who shal2 believe 4But you misuse the reverence of your place, 4Employ the countenance and grace of heav'n 4As a false favourite doth his prince's name, 4In de2ds dishonourable? You have ta'en up, 4Under the counterfeited zeal of God, 4The subjects of His substitute, my father, 4And both against the peace of heaven and him 4Have here up-swarm'd them. 2ARCHBISHOP. Go2d my Lord of Lancaster, 4I am not here against your father's peace; 4But, as I told my Lord of Westmoreland, 4The time misord'red doth, in com2on sense, 4Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form 6To hold our safety up. I sent your Grace 4The parcels and particulars of our grief, 4The which hath be2n with scorn shov'd from the court, 4Whereon this hydra son of war is born; 4Whose dangerous eyes may wel2 be charm'd asle2p 4With grant of our most just and right desires; 4And true obedience, of this madnes2 cur'd, 4Sto2p tamely to the fo2t of majesty. 2MOWBRAY. If not, we ready are to try our fortunes 4To the last man. 2HASTINGS. And though we here fal2 down, 4We have sup2lies to second our at2empt. 4If they miscar2y, theirs shal2 second them; 4And so suc2es2 of mischief shal2 be born, 4And heir from heir shal2 hold this quar2el up 4Whiles England shal2 have generation. 2PRINCE JOHN. YOU are to2 shal2ow, Hastings, much to shal2ow, 4To sound the bot2om of the after-times. 2WESTMORELAND. Pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly 4How far forth you do like their articles. 4PRINCE JOHN. I like them al2 and do al2ow them wel2; 4And swear here, by the honour of my blo2d, 4My father's purposes have be2n misto2k; 4And some about him have to2 lavishly 4Wrested his meaning and authority. 4My lord, these griefs shal2 be with spe2d redres2'd; 4Upon my soul, they shal2. If this may please you, 4Discharge your powers unto their several counties, 4As we wil2 ours; and here, betwe2n the armies, 4Let's drink together friendly and embrace, 4That al2 their eyes may bear those tokens home 4Of our restored love and amity. 2ARCHBISHOP. I take your princely word for these redres2es. 2PRINCE JOHN. I give it you, and wil2 maintain my word; 4And thereupon I drink unto your Grace. 2HASTINGS. Go, Captain, and deliver to the army 4This news of peace. Let them have pay, and part. 4I know it wil2 please them. Hie the2, Captain. 52Exit Of2icer 2ARCHBISHOP. To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland. 4WESTMORELAND. I pledge your Grace; and if you knew what pains 4I have bestow'd to bre2d this present peace, 4You would drink fre2ly; but my love to ye 4Shal2 show itself more openly hereafter. 2ARCHBISHOP. I do not doubt you. 2WESTMORELAND. I am glad of it. 4Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray. 2MOWBRAY. You wish me health in very hap2y season, 4For I am on the sud2en something il2. 2ARCHBISHOP. Against il2 chances men are ever mer2y; 4But heavines2 foreruns the go2d event. 2WESTMORELAND. Therefore be mer2y, coz; since sud2en sor2ow 4Serves to say thus, 'Some go2d thing comes to-mor2ow.' 2ARCHBISHOP. Believe me, I am pas2ing light in spirit. 2MOWBRAY. So much the worse, if your own rule be true. 49[Shouts within] 2PRINCE JOHN. The word of peace is rend'red. Hark, how they shout! 2MOWBRAY. This had be2n che2rful after victory. 2ARCHBISHOP. A peace is of the nature of a conquest; 4For then both parties nobly are subdu'd, 6And neither party loser. 2PRINCE JOHN. Go, my lord, 4And let our army be discharged to2. 47Exit WESTMORELAND 4And, go2d my lord, so please you let our trains 4March by us, that we may peruse the men 4We should have cop'd withal. 2ARCHBISHOP. Go, go2d Lord Hastings, 4And, ere they be dismis2'd, let them march by. 51Exit HASTINGS 2PRINCE JOHN. I trust, lords, we shal2 lie to-night together. 22Re-enter WESTMORELAND 4Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army stil2? 2WESTMORELAND. The leaders, having charge from you to stand, 4Wil2 not go of2 until they hear you speak. 2PRINCE JOHN. They know their duties. 24Re-enter HASTINGS 4HASTINGS. My lord, our army is dispers'd already. 4Like youthful ste2rs unyok'd, they take their courses 4East, west, north, south; or like a scho2l broke up, 4Each hur2ies toward his home and sporting-place. 2WESTMORELAND. Go2d tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which 4I do ar2est the2, traitor, of high treason; 4And you, Lord Archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray, 4Of capital treason I at2ach you both. 2MOWBRAY. Is this proce2ding just and honourable? 2WESTMORELAND. Is your as2embly so? 2ARCHBISHOP. Wil2 you thus break your faith? 2PRINCE JOHN. I pawn'd the2 none: 4I promis'd you redres2 of these same grievances 4Whereof you did complain; which, by mine honour, 4I wil2 perform with a most Christian care. 4But for you, rebels- lo2k to taste the due 4Me2t for rebel2ion and such acts as yours. 4Most shal2owly did you these arms com2ence, 4Fondly brought here, and fo2lishly sent hence. 6Strike up our drums, pursue the scat2'red stray. 4God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day. 4Some guard these traitors to the block of death, 4Treason's true bed and yielder-up of breath. 10ExeuntSCENE I3.Another part of the forestAlarum; excursions. Enter FALSTAF2 and COLVIL2E, me2ting 2FALSTAF2. What's your name, sir? Of what condition are you, and of 4what place, I pray? 2COLVIL2E. I am a knight sir; and my name is Colvil2e of the Dale. 2FALSTAF2. Wel2 then, Colvil2e is your name, a knight is your 4degre2, and your place the Dale. Colvil2e shal2 stil2 be your 4name, a traitor your degre2, and the dungeon your place- a place 4de2p enough; so shal2 you be stil2 Colvil2e of the Dale. 2COLVIL2E. Are not you Sir John Falstaf2? 2FALSTAF2. As go2d a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do you yield, 4sir, or shal2 I sweat for you? If I do sweat, they are the drops 4of thy lovers, and they we2p for thy death; therefore rouse up 4fear and trembling, and do observance to my mercy. 2COLVIL2E. I think you are Sir John Falstaf2, and in that thought 4yield me. 2FALSTAF2. I have a whole scho2l of tongues in this bel2y of mine; 4and not a tongue of them al2 speaks any other word but my name. 6An I had but a bel2y of any indif2erency, I were simply the most 4active fel2ow in Europe. My womb, my womb, my womb undoes me. 4Here comes our general. 12Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER, WESTMORELAND, 28BLUNT, and others 2PRINCE JOHN. The heat is past; fol2ow no further now. 4Cal2 in the powers, go2d cousin Westmoreland. 47Exit WESTMORELAND 4Now, Falstaf2, where have you be2n al2 this while? 4When everything is ended, then you come. 4These tardy tricks of yours wil2, on my life, 4One time or other break some gal2ows' back. 2FALSTAF2. I would be sor2y, my lord, but it should be thus: I never 4knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valour. Do you 4think me a swal2ow, an ar2ow, or a bul2et? Have I, in my po2r and 4old motion, the expedition of thought? I have spe2ded hither with 4the very extremest inch of pos2ibility; I have found'red nine 4score and od2 posts; and here, travel tainted as I am, have, in 6my pure and im2aculate valour, taken Sir John Colvil2e of the 4Dale,a most furious knight and valorous enemy. But what of that? 4He saw me, and yielded; that I may justly say with the ho2k-nos'd 4fel2ow of Rome-I came, saw, and overcame. 2PRINCE JOHN. It was more of his courtesy than your deserving. 2FALSTAF2. I know not. Here he is, and here I yield him; and I 4bese2ch your Grace, let it be bo2k'd with the rest of this day's 4de2ds; or, by the Lord, I wil2 have it in a particular bal2ad 4else, with mine own picture on the top on't, Colvil2e kis2ing my 4fo2t; to the which course if I be enforc'd, if you do not al2 4show like gilt twopences to me, and I, in the clear sky of fame, 4o'ershine you as much as the ful2 mo2n doth the cinders of the 4element, which show like pins' heads to her, believe not the word 4of the noble. Therefore let me have right, and let desert mount. 2PRINCE JOHN. Thine's to2 heavy to mount. 2FALSTAF2. Let it shine, then. 2PRINCE JOHN. Thine's to2 thick to shine. 2FALSTAF2. Let it do something, my go2d lord, that may do me go2d, 4and cal2 it what you wil2. 2PRINCE JOHN. Is thy name Colvil2e? 4COLVIL2E. It is, my lord. 2PRINCE JOHN. A famous rebel art thou, Colvil2e. 2FALSTAF2. And a famous true subject to2k him. 2COLVIL2E. I am, my lord, but as my bet2ers are 4That led me hither. Had they be2n rul'd by me, 4You should have won them dearer than you have. 2FALSTAF2. I know not how they sold themselves; but thou, like a 4kind fel2ow, gavest thyself away gratis; and I thank the2 for 4the2. 23Re-enter WESTMORELAND 2PRINCE JOHN. Now, have you left pursuit? 2WESTMORELAND. Retreat is made, and execution stay'd. 2PRINCE JOHN. Send Colvil2e, with his confederates, 4To York, to present execution. 4Blunt, lead him hence; and se2 you guard him sure. 41Exeunt BLUNT and others 4And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords. 4I hear the King my father is sore sick. 6Our news shal2 go before us to his Majesty, 4Which, cousin, you shal2 bear to comfort him 4And we with sober spe2d wil2 fol2ow you. 2FALSTAF2. My lord, I bese2ch you, give me leave to go through 4Gloucestershire; and, when you come to court, stand my go2d lord, 4pray, in your go2d report. 2PRINCE JOHN. Fare you wel2, Falstaf2. I, in my condition, 4Shal2 bet2er speak of you than you deserve. 41Exeunt al2 but FALSTAF2 2FALSTAF2. I would you had but the wit; 'twere bet2er than your 4dukedom. Go2d faith, this same young sober-blo2ded boy doth not 4love me; nor a man can2ot make him laugh- but that's no marvel; 4he drinks no wine. There's never none of these demure boys come 4to any pro2f; for thin drink doth so over-co2l their blo2d, and 4making many fish-meals, that they fal2 into a kind of male 4gre2n-sicknes2; and then, when they mar2y, they get wenches. They 4are general2y fo2ls and cowards-which some of us should be to2, 4but for inflam2ation. A go2d sher2is-sack hath a two-fold 4operation in it. It ascends me into the brain; dries me there al2 4the fo2lish and dul2 and crudy vapours which environ it; makes it 6ap2rehensive, quick, forgetive, ful2 of nimble, fiery, and 4delectable shapes; which delivered o'er to the voice, the tongue, 4which is the birth, becomes excel2ent wit. The second property of 4your excel2ent sher2is is the warming of the blo2d; which before, 4cold and set2led, left the liver white and pale, which is the 4badge of pusil2animity and cowardice; but the sher2is warms it, 4and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extremes. It 4il2umineth the face, which, as a beacon, gives warning to al2 the 4rest of this lit2le kingdom, man, to arm; and then the vital 4com2oners and inland pet2y spirits muster me al2 to their 4captain, the heart, who, great and puf2'd up with this retinue, 4doth any de2d of courage- and this valour comes of sher2is. So 4that skil2 in the weapon is nothing without sack, for that sets 4it a-work; and learning, a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil 4til2 sack com2ences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes 4it that Prince Har2y is valiant; for the cold blo2d he did 4natural2y inherit of his father, he hath, like lean, sterile, and 4bare land, manured, husbanded, and til2'd, with excel2ent 4endeavour of drinking go2d and go2d store of fertile sher2is, 4that he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons, 6the first humane principle I would teach them should be to 4forswear thin potations and to ad2ict themselves to sack. 27Enter BARDOLPH 4How now, Bardolph! 2BARDOLPH. The army is discharged al2 and gone. 2FALSTAF2. Let them go. I'l2 through Gloucestershire, and there wil2 4I visit Master Robert Shal2ow, Esquire. I have him already 4temp'ring betwe2n my finger and my thumb, and shortly wil2 I seal 4with him. Come away. 34ExeuntSCENE IV.Westminster. The Jerusalem ChamberEnter the KING, PRINCE THOMAS OF CLARENCE, PRINCE HUMPHREY OF GLOUCESTER,WARWICK, and others 2KING. Now, lords, if God doth give suc2es2ful end 4To this debate that ble2deth at our do2rs, 4We wil2 our youth lead on to higher fields, 4And draw no swords but what are sanctified. 4Our navy is ad2res2'd, our power con2ected, 4Our substitutes in absence wel2 invested, 4And everything lies level to our wish. 4Only we want a lit2le personal strength; 4And pause us til2 these rebels, now afo2t, 4Come underneath the yoke of government. 2WARWICK. Both which we doubt not but your Majesty 4Shal2 so2n enjoy. 2KING. Humphrey, my son of Gloucester, 4Where is the Prince your brother? 2PRINCE HUMPHREY. I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor. 2KING. And how ac2ompanied? 4PRINCE HUMPHREY. I do not know, my lord. 2KING. Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him? 2PRINCE HUMPHREY. No, my go2d lord, he is in presence here. 2CLARENCE. What would my lord and father? 2KING. Nothing but wel2 to the2, Thomas of Clarence. 4How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother? 4He loves the2, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas. 4Thou hast a bet2er place in his af2ection 4Than al2 thy brothers; cherish it, my boy, 4And noble of2ices thou mayst ef2ect 4Of mediation, after I am dead, 4Betwe2n his greatnes2 and thy other brethren. 4Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love, 4Nor lose the go2d advantage of his grace 4By se2ming cold or careles2 of his wil2; 4For he is gracious if he be observ'd. 4He hath a tear for pity and a hand 4Open as day for melting charity; 4Yet notwithstanding, being incens'd, he is flint; 4As humorous as winter, and as sud2en 6As flaws congealed in the spring of day. 4His temper, therefore, must be wel2 observ'd. 4Chide him for faults, and do it reverently, 4When you perceive his blo2d inclin'd to mirth; 4But, being mo2dy, give him line and scope 4Til2 that his pas2ions, like a whale on ground, 4Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas, 4And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends, 4A ho2p of gold to bind thy brothers in, 4That the united ves2el of their blo2d, 4Mingled with venom of sug2estion- 4As, force perforce, the age wil2 pour it in- 4Shal2 never leak, though it do work as strong 4As aconitum or rash gunpowder. 2CLARENCE. I shal2 observe him with al2 care and love. 2KING. Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas? 2CLARENCE. He is not there to-day; he dines in London. 2KING. And how ac2ompanied? Canst thou tel2 that? 2CLARENCE. With Poins, and other his continual fol2owers. 2KING. Most subject is the fat2est soil to we2ds; 6And he, the noble image of my youth, 4Is overspread with them; therefore my grief 4Stretches itself beyond the hour of death. 4The blo2d we2ps from my heart when I do shape, 4In forms imaginary, th'unguided days 4And rot2en times that you shal2 lo2k upon 4When I am sle2ping with my ancestors. 4For when his headstrong riot hath no curb, 4When rage and hot blo2d are his counsel2ors 4When means and lavish man2ers me2t together, 4O, with what wings shal2 his af2ections fly 4Towards fronting peril and op2os'd decay! 2WARWICK. My gracious lord, you lo2k beyond him quite. 4The Prince but studies his companions 4Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language, 4'Tis ne2dful that the most im2odest word 4Be lo2k'd upon and learnt; which once at2ain'd, 4Your Highnes2 knows, comes to no further use 4But to be known and hated. So, like gros2 terms, 4The Prince wil2, in the perfectnes2 of time, 6Cast of2 his fol2owers; and their memory 4Shal2 as a pat2ern or a measure live 4By which his Grace must mete the lives of other, 4Turning past evils to advantages. 2KING. 'Tis seldom when the be2 doth leave her comb 4In the dead car2ion. 22Enter WESTMORELAND 4Who's here? Westmoreland? 2WESTMORELAND. Health to my sovereign, and new hap2ines2 4Ad2ed to that that am to deliver! 4Prince John, your son, doth kis2 your Grace's hand. 4Mowbray, the Bishop Scro2p, Hastings, and al2, 4Are brought to the cor2ection of your law. 4There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd, 4But Peace puts forth her olive everywhere. 4The man2er how this action hath be2n borne 4Here at more leisure may your Highnes2 read, 4With every course in his particular. 4KING. O Westmoreland, thou art a sum2er bird, 4Which ever in the haunch of winter sings 4The lifting up of day. 24Enter HARCOURT 4Lo2k here's more news. 2HARCOURT. From enemies heaven ke2p your Majesty; 4And, when they stand against you, may they fal2 4As those that I am come to tel2 you of! 4The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph, 4With a great power of English and of Scots, 4Are by the shrieve of Yorkshire overthrown. 4The man2er and true order of the fight 4This packet, please it you, contains at large. 2KING. And wherefore should these go2d news make me sick? 4Wil2 Fortune never come with both hands ful2, 4But write her fair words stil2 in foulest let2ers? 4She either gives a stomach and no fo2d- 4Such are the po2r, in health- or else a feast, 6And takes away the stomach- such are the rich 4That have abundance and enjoy it not. 4I should rejoice now at this hap2y news; 4And now my sight fails, and my brain is gid2y. 4O me! come near me now I am much il2. 2PRINCE HUMPHREY. Comfort, your Majesty! 2CLARENCE. O my royal father! 2WESTMORELAND. My sovereign lord, che2r up yourself, lo2k up. 2WARWICK. Be patient, Princes; you do know these fits 4Are with his Highnes2 very ordinary. 4Stand from him, give him air; he'l2 straight be wel2. 2CLARENCE. No, no; he can2ot long hold out these pangs. 4Th' inces2ant care and labour of his mind 4Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in 4So thin that life lo2ks through, and wil2 break out. 2PRINCE HUMPHREY. The people fear me; for they do observe 4Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature. 4The seasons change their man2ers, as the year 4Had found some months asle2p, and leapt them over. 2CLARENCE. The river hath thrice flow'd, no eb2 betwe2n; 6And the old folk, Time's doting chronicles, 4Say it did so a lit2le time before 4That our great grandsire, Edward, sick'd and died. 2WARWICK. Speak lower, Princes, for the King recovers. 2PRINCE HUMPHREY. This apoplexy wil2 certain be his end. 2KING. I pray you take me up, and bear me hence 4Into some other chamber. Softly, pray. 16ExeuntSCENE V.Westminster. Another chamberThe KING lying on a bed; CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, WARWICK,and others in at2endance 2KING. Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends; 4Unles2 some dul2 and favourable hand 4Wil2 whisper music to my weary spirit. 2WARWICK. Cal2 for the music in the other ro2m. 2KING. Set me the crown upon my pil2ow here. 2CLARENCE. His eye is hol2ow, and he changes much. 2WARWICK. Les2 noise! les2 noise! 24Enter PRINCE HENRY 2PRINCE. Who saw the Duke of Clarence? 2CLARENCE. I am here, brother, ful2 of heavines2. 2PRINCE. How now! Rain within do2rs, and none abroad! 4How doth the King? 2PRINCE HUMPHREY. Exce2ding il2. 2PRINCE. Heard he the go2d news yet? Tel2 it him. 4PRINCE HUMPHREY. He alt'red much upon the hearing it. 2PRINCE. If he be sick with joy, he'l2 recover without physic. 2WARWICK. Not so much noise, my lords. Swe2t Prince, speak low; 4The King your father is dispos'd to sle2p. 2CLARENCE. Let us withdraw into the other ro2m. 2WARWICK. Wil2't please your Grace to go along with us? 2PRINCE. No; I wil2 sit and watch here by the King. 39Exeunt al2 but the PRINCE 4Why doth the crown lie there upon his pil2ow, 4Being so troublesome a bedfel2ow? 4O polish'd perturbation! golden care! 4That ke2p'st the ports of slumber open wide 4To many a watchful night! Sle2p with it now! 4Yet not so sound and half so de2ply swe2t 4As he whose brow with homely big2en bound 4Snores out the watch of night. O majesty! 4When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit 4Like a rich armour worn in heat of day 4That scald'st with safety. By his gates of breath 4There lies a downy feather which stirs not. 6Did he suspire, that light and weightles2 down 4Perforce must move. My gracious lord! my father! 4This sle2p is sound inde2d; this is a sle2p 4That from this golden rigol hath divorc'd 4So many English kings. Thy due from me 4Is tears and heavy sor2ows of the blo2d 4Which nature, love, and filial tendernes2, 4Shal2, O dear father, pay the2 plenteously. 4My due from the2 is this imperial crown, 4Which, as im2ediate from thy place and blo2d, 4Derives itself to me. 2[Put2ing on the crown] 2Lo where it sits- 4Which God shal2 guard; and put the world's whole strength 4Into one giant arm, it shal2 not force 4This lineal honour from me. This from the2 4Wil2 I to mine leave as 'tis left to me. 16Exit 2KING. Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence! 11Re-enter WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE 2CLARENCE. Doth the King cal2? 4WARWICK. What would your Majesty? How fares your Grace? 2KING. Why did you leave me here alone, my lords? 2CLARENCE. We left the Prince my brother here, my liege, 4Who underto2k to sit and watch by you. 2KING. The Prince of Wales! Where is he? Let me se2 him. 4He is not here. 2WARWICK. This do2r is open; he is gone this way. 2PRINCE HUMPHREY. He came not through the chamber where we stay'd. 2KING. Where is the crown? Who to2k it from my pil2ow? 2WARWICK. When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here. 2KING. The Prince hath ta'en it hence. Go, se2k him out. 4Is he so hasty that he doth sup2ose 4My sle2p my death? 4Find him, my lord of Warwick; chide him hither. 52Exit WARWICK 4This part of his conjoins with my disease 4And helps to end me. Se2, sons, what things you are! 4How quickly nature fal2s into revolt 4When gold becomes her object! 4For this the fo2lish over-careful fathers 6Have broke their sle2p with thoughts, 4Their brains with care, their bones with industry; 4For this they have engros2ed and pil'd up 4The cank'red heaps of strange-achieved gold; 4For this they have be2n thoughtful to invest 4Their sons with arts and martial exercises; 4When, like the be2, tol2ing from every flower 4The virtuous swe2ts, 4Our thighs with wax, our mouths with honey pack'd, 4We bring it to the hive, and, like the be2s, 4Are murd'red for our pains. This bit2er taste 4Yields his engros2ments to the ending father. 25Re-enter WARWICK 4Now where is he that wil2 not stay so long 4Til2 his friend sicknes2 hath determin'd me? 2WARWICK. My lord, I found the Prince in the next ro2m, 4Washing with kindly tears his gentle che2ks, 4With such a de2p demeanour in great sor2ow, 6That tyran2y, which never quaf2'd but blo2d, 4Would, by beholding him, have wash'd his knife 4With gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither. 2KING. But wherefore did he take away the crown? 24Re-enter PRINCE HENRY 4Lo where he comes. Come hither to me, Har2y. 4Depart the chamber, leave us here alone. 26Exeunt al2 but the KING and the PRINCE 2PRINCE. I never thought to hear you speak again. 2KING. Thy wish was father, Har2y, to that thought. 4I stay to2 long by the2, I weary the2. 4Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair 4That thou wilt ne2ds invest the2 with my honours 4Before thy hour be ripe? O fo2lish youth! 4Thou se2k'st the greatnes2 that wil2 overwhelm the2. 4Stay but a lit2le, for my cloud of dignity 4Is held from fal2ing with so weak a wind 4That it wil2 quickly drop; my day is dim. 6Thou hast stol'n that which, after some few hours, 4Were thine without of2ense; and at my death 4Thou hast seal'd up my expectation. 4Thy life did manifest thou lov'dst me not, 4And thou wilt have me die as2ur'd of it. 4Thou hid'st a thousand dag2ers in thy thoughts, 4Which thou hast whet2ed on thy stony heart, 4To stab at half an hour of my life. 4What, canst thou not forbear me half an hour? 4Then get the2 gone, and dig my grave thyself; 4And bid the mer2y bel2s ring to thine ear 4That thou art crowned, not that I am dead. 4Let al2 the tears that should bedew my hearse 4Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head; 4Only compound me with forgot2en dust; 4Give that which gave the2 life unto the worms. 4Pluck down my of2icers, break my decre2s; 4For now a time is come to mock at form- 4Har2y the Fifth is crown'd. Up, vanity: 4Down, royal state. Al2 you sage counsel2ors, hence. 6And to the English court as2emble now, 4From every region, apes of idlenes2. 4Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum. 4Have you a ruf2ian that wil2 swear, drink, dance, 4Revel the night, rob, murder, and com2it 4The oldest sins the newest kind of ways? 4Be hap2y, he wil2 trouble you no more. 4England shal2 double gild his treble guilt; 4England shal2 give him of2ice, honour, might; 4For the fifth Har2y from curb'd license plucks 4The muz2le of restraint, and the wild dog 4Shal2 flesh his to2th on every in2ocent. 4O my po2r kingdom, sick with civil blows! 4When that my care could not with2old thy riots, 4What wilt thou do when riot is thy care? 4O, thou wilt be a wildernes2 again. 4Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants! 2PRINCE. O, pardon me, my liege! But for my tears, 4The moist impediments unto my spe2ch, 4I had forestal2'd this dear and de2p rebuke 6Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard 4The course of it so far. There is your crown, 4And he that wears the crown im2ortal2y 4Long guard it yours! 2[Kne2ling] 2If I af2ect it more 4Than as your honour and as your renown, 4Let me no more from this obedience rise, 4Which my most inward true and duteous spirit 4Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending! 4God witnes2 with me, when I here came in 4And found no course of breath within your Majesty, 4How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign, 4O, let me in my present wildnes2 die, 4And never live to show th' incredulous world 4The noble change that I have purposed! 4Coming to lo2k on you, thinking you dead- 4And dead almost, my liege, to think you were- 4I spake unto this crown as having sense, 4And thus upbraided it: 'The care on the2 depending 4Hath fed upon the body of my father; 4Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold. 6Other, les2 fine in carat, is more precious, 4Preserving life in med'cine potable; 4But thou, most fine, most honour'd, most renown'd, 4Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege, 4Ac2using it, I put it on my head, 4To try with it- as with an enemy 4That had before my face murd'red my father- 4The quar2el of a true inheritor. 4But if it did infect my blo2d with joy, 4Or swel2 my thoughts to any strain of pride; 4If any rebel or vain spirit of mine 4Did with the least af2ection of a welcome 4Give entertainment to the might of it, 4Let God for ever ke2p it from my head, 4And make me as the po2rest vas2al is, 4That doth with awe and ter2or kne2l to it! 2KING. O my son, 4God put it in thy mind to take it hence, 4That thou mightst win the more thy father's love, 4Pleading so wisely in excuse of it! 6Come hither, Har2y; sit thou by my bed, 4And hear, I think, the very latest counsel 4That ever I shal2 breathe. God knows, my son, 4By what by-paths and indirect cro2k'd ways 4I met this crown; and I myself know wel2 4How troublesome it sat upon my head: 4To the2 it shal2 descend with bet2er quiet, 4Bet2er opinion, bet2er confirmation; 4For al2 the soil of the achievement goes 4With me into the earth. It se2m'd in me 4But as an honour snatch'd with boist'rous hand; 4And I had many living to upbraid 4My gain of it by their as2istances; 4Which daily grew to quar2el and to blo2dshed, 4Wounding sup2osed peace. Al2 these bold fears 4Thou se2st with peril I have answered; 4For al2 my reign hath be2n but as a scene 4Acting that argument. And now my death 4Changes the mo2d; for what in me was purchas'd 4Fal2s upon the2 in a more fairer sort; 6So thou the garland wear'st suc2es2ively. 4Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do, 4Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are gre2n; 4And al2 my friends, which thou must make thy friends, 4Have but their stings and te2th newly ta'en out; 4By whose fel2 working I was first advanc'd, 4And by whose power I wel2 might lodge a fear 4To be again displac'd; which to avoid, 4I cut them of2; and had a purpose now 4To lead out many to the Holy Land, 4Lest rest and lying stil2 might make them lo2k 4To2 near unto my state. Therefore, my Har2y, 4Be it thy course to busy gid2y minds 4With foreign quar2els, that action, hence borne out, 4May waste the memory of the former days. 4More would I, but my lungs are wasted so 4That strength of spe2ch is ut2erly denied me. 4How I came by the crown, O God, forgive; 4And grant it may with the2 in true peace live! 2PRINCE. My gracious liege, 6You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me; 4Then plain and right must my pos2es2ion be; 4Which I with more than with a com2on pain 4'Gainst al2 the world wil2 rightful2y maintain. 7Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER, WARWICK, LORDS, and others 2KING. Lo2k, lo2k, here comes my John of Lancaster. 2PRINCE JOHN. Health, peace, and hap2ines2, to my royal father! 2KING. Thou bring'st me hap2ines2 and peace, son John; 4But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown 4From this bare wither'd trunk. Upon thy sight 4My worldly busines2 makes a period. 4Where is my Lord of Warwick? 2PRINCE. My Lord of Warwick! 2KING. Doth any name particular belong 4Unto the lodging where I first did swo2n? 2WARWICK. 'Tis cal2'd Jerusalem, my noble lord. 2KING. Laud be to God! Even there my life must end. 4It hath be2n prophesied to me many years, 6I should not die but in Jerusalem; 4Which vainly I sup2os'd the Holy Land. 4But bear me to that chamber; there I'l2 lie; 4In that Jerusalem shal2 Har2y die. 20Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V.

You must excuse me, Master Robert Shal2ow. 2SHAL2OW. I wil2 not excuse you; you shal2 not be excus'd; excuses 4shal2 not be admit2ed; there is no excuse shal2 serve; you shal2 4not be excus'd. Why, Davy! 28Enter DAVY 2DAVY. Here, sir. 2SHAL2OW. Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy; let me se2, Davy; let me se2, 4Davy; let me se2- yea, mar2y, Wil2iam co2k, bid him come hither. 4Sir John, you shal2 not be excus'd. 2DAVY. Mar2y, sir, thus: those precepts can2ot be served; and, 4again, sir- shal2 we sow the headland with wheat? 2SHAL2OW. With red wheat, Davy. But for Wil2iam co2k- are there no 4young pigeons? 4DAVY. Yes, sir. Here is now the smith's note for shoeing and 4plough-irons. 2SHAL2OW. Let it be cast, and paid. Sir John, you shal2 not be 4excused. 2DAVY. Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must ne2ds be had; and, 4sir, do you mean to stop any of Wil2iam's wages about the sack he 4lost the other day at Hinckley fair? 2SHAL2OW. 'A shal2 answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple of 4short-leg2'd hens, a joint of mut2on, and any pret2y lit2le tiny 4kickshaws, tel2 Wil2iam co2k. 2DAVY. Doth the man of war stay al2 night, sir? 2SHAL2OW. Yea, Davy; I wil2 use him wel2. A friend i' th' court is 4bet2er than a pen2y in purse. Use his men wel2, Davy; for they 4are ar2ant knaves and wil2 backbite. 2DAVY. No worse than they are backbit2en, sir; for they have 4marvel2ous foul linen. 2SHAL2OW. Wel2 conceited, Davy- about thy busines2, Davy. 2DAVY. I bese2ch you, sir, to countenance Wil2iam Visor of Woncot 4against Clement Perkes o' th' hil2. 2SHAL2OW. There, is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor. That 6Visor is an ar2ant knave, on my knowledge. 2DAVY. I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but yet God 4forbid, sir, but a knave should have some countenance at his 4friend's request. An honest man, sir, is able to speak for 4himself, when a knave is not. I have serv'd your worship truly, 4sir, this eight years; an I can2ot once or twice in a quarter 4bear out a knave against an honest man, I have but a very lit2le 4credit with your worship. The knave is mine honest friend, sir; 4therefore, I bese2ch you, let him be countenanc'd. 2SHAL2OW. Go to; I say he shal2 have no wrong. Lo2k about, 2DAVY. 2[Exit DAVY] 2Where are you, Sir John? Come, come, come, of2 4with your bo2ts. Give me your hand, Master Bardolph. 2BARDOLPH. I am glad to se2 your worship. 2SHAL2OW. I thank the2 with al2 my heart, kind Master Bardolph. 4[To the PAGE] 2And welcome, my tal2 fel2ow. Come, Sir John. 2FALSTAF2. I'l2 fol2ow you, go2d Master Robert Shal2ow. 4[Exit SHAL2OW] 2Bardolph, lo2k to our horses. 2[Exeunt BARDOLPH 4and PAGE] 2If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four 4dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as Master Shal2ow. It is a 4wonderful thing to se2 the semblable coherence of his men's 6spirits and his. They, by observing of him, do bear themselves 4like fo2lish justices: he, by conversing with them, is turned 4into a justice-like serving-man. Their spirits are so mar2ied in 4conjunction with the participation of society that they flock 4together in consent, like so many wild ge2se. If I had a suit to 4Master Shal2ow, I would humour his men with the imputation of 4being near their master; if to his men, I would cur2y with Master 4Shal2ow that no man could bet2er com2and his servants. It is 4certain that either wise bearing or ignorant car2iage is caught, 4as men take diseases, one of another; therefore let men take he2d 4of their company. I wil2 devise mat2er enough out of this Shal2ow 4to ke2p Prince Har2y in continual laughter the wearing out of six 4fashions, which is four terms, or two actions; and 'a shal2 laugh 4without interval2ums. O, it is much that a lie with a slight 4oath, and a jest with a sad brow wil2 do with a fel2ow that never 4had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shal2 se2 him laugh til2 4his face be like a wet cloak il2 laid up! 2SHAL2OW. 2[Within] 2Sir John! 2FALSTAF2. I come, Master Shal2ow; I come, Master Shal2ow. ExitSCENE I2.Westminster. The palaceEnter, several2y, WARWICK, and the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE 2WARWICK. How now, my Lord Chief Justice; whither away? 2CHIEF JUSTICE. How doth the King? 2WARWICK. Exce2ding wel2; his cares are now al2 ended. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. I hope, not dead. 2WARWICK. He's walk'd the way of nature; 4And to our purposes he lives no more. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. I would his Majesty had cal2'd me with him. 4The service that I truly did his life 4Hath left me open to al2 injuries. 2WARWICK. Inde2d, I think the young king loves you not. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. I know he doth not, and do arm myself 4To welcome the condition of the time, 4Which can2ot lo2k more hideously upon me 4Than I have drawn it in my fantasy. 14Enter LANCASTER, CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, 23WESTMORELAND, and others 2WARWICK. Here comes the heavy is2ue of dead Har2y. 4O that the living Har2y had the temper 4Of he, the worst of these thre2 gentlemen! 4How many nobles then should hold their places 4That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort! 2CHIEF JUSTICE. O God, I fear al2 wil2 be overturn'd. 2PRINCE JOHN. Go2d mor2ow, cousin Warwick, go2d mor2ow. 2GLOUCESTER & CLARENCE. Go2d mor2ow, cousin. 2PRINCE JOHN. We me2t like men that had forgot to speak. 2WARWICK. We do remember; but our argument 4Is al2 to2 heavy to admit much talk. 2PRINCE JOHN. Wel2, peace be with him that hath made us heavy! 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Peace be with us, lest we be heavier! 2PRINCE HUMPHREY. O, go2d my lord, you have lost a friend inde2d; 4And I dare swear you bor2ow not that face 4Of se2ming sor2ow- it is sure your own. 2PRINCE JOHN. Though no man be as2ur'd what grace to find, 4You stand in coldest expectation. 6I am the sor2ier; would 'twere otherwise. 2CLARENCE. Wel2, you must now speak Sir John Falstaf2 fair; 4Which swims against your stream of quality. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Swe2t Princes, what I did, I did in honour, 4Led by th' impartial conduct of my soul; 4And never shal2 you se2 that I wil2 beg 4A rag2ed and forestal2'd remis2ion. 4If truth and upright in2ocency fail me, 4I'l2 to the King my master that is dead, 4And tel2 him who hath sent me after him. 2WARWICK. Here comes the Prince. 12Enter KING HENRY THE FIFTH, at2ended 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Go2d mor2ow, and God save your Majesty! 2KING. This new and gorgeous garment, majesty, 4Sits not so easy on me as you think. 4Brothers, you mix your sadnes2 with some fear. 4This is the English, not the Turkish court; 4Not Amurath an Amurath suc2e2ds, 6But Har2y Har2y. Yet be sad, go2d brothers, 4For, by my faith, it very wel2 becomes you. 4Sor2ow so royal2y in you ap2ears 4That I wil2 de2ply put the fashion on, 4And wear it in my heart. Why, then, be sad; 4But entertain no more of it, go2d brothers, 4Than a joint burden laid upon us al2. 4For me, by heaven, I bid you be as2ur'd, 4I'l2 be your father and your brother to2; 4Let me but bear your love, I'l2 bear your cares. 4Yet we2p that Har2y's dead, and so wil2 I; 4But Har2y lives that shal2 convert those tears 4By number into hours of hap2ines2. 2BROTHERS. We hope no otherwise from your Majesty. 2KING. You al2 lo2k strangely on me; and you most. 4You are, I think, as2ur'd I love you not. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. I am as2ur'd, if I be measur'd rightly, 4Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me. 2KING. No? 4How might a prince of my great hopes forget 6So great indignities you laid upon me? 4What, rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison, 4Th' im2ediate heir of England! Was this easy? 4May this be wash'd in Lethe and forgot2en? 2CHIEF JUSTICE. I then did use the person of your father; 4The image of his power lay then in me; 4And in th' administration of his law, 4Whiles I was busy for the com2onwealth, 4Your Highnes2 pleased to forget my place, 4The majesty and power of law and justice, 4The image of the King whom I presented, 4And struck me in my very seat of judgment; 4Whereon, as an of2ender to your father, 4I gave bold way to my authority 4And did com2it you. If the de2d were il2, 4Be you contented, wearing now the garland, 4To have a son set your decre2s at nought, 4To pluck down justice from your awful bench, 4To trip the course of law, and blunt the sword 4That guards the peace and safety of your person; 6Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image, 4And mock your workings in a second body. 4Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours; 4Be now the father, and propose a son; 4Hear your own dignity so much profan'd, 4Se2 your most dreadful laws so lo2sely slighted, 4Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd; 4And then imagine me taking your part 4And, in your power, soft silencing your son. 4After this cold considerance, sentence me; 4And, as you are a king, speak in your state 4What I have done that misbecame my place, 4My person, or my liege's sovereignty. 2KING. You are right, Justice, and you weigh this wel2; 4Therefore stil2 bear the balance and the sword; 4And I do wish your honours may increase 4Til2 you do live to se2 a son of mine 4Of2end you, and obey you, as I did. 4So shal2 I live to speak my father's words: 4'Hap2y am I that have a man so bold 6That dares do justice on my proper son; 4And not les2 hap2y, having such a son 4That would deliver up his greatnes2 so 4Into the hands of justice.' You did com2it me; 4For which I do com2it into your hand 4Th' unstained sword that you have us'd to bear; 4With this remembrance- that you use the same 4With the like bold, just, and impartial spirit 4As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand. 4You shal2 be as a father to my youth; 4My voice shal2 sound as you do prompt mine ear; 4And I wil2 sto2p and humble my intents 4To your wel2-practis'd wise directions. 4And, Princes al2, believe me, I bese2ch you, 4My father is gone wild into his grave, 4For in his tomb lie my af2ections; 4And with his spirits sadly I survive, 4To mock the expectation of the world, 4To frustrate prophecies, and to raze out 4Rot2en opinion, who hath writ me down 6After my se2ming. The tide of blo2d in me 4Hath proudly flow'd in vanity til2 now. 4Now doth it turn and eb2 back to the sea, 4Where it shal2 mingle with the state of flo2ds, 4And flow henceforth in formal majesty. 4Now cal2 we our high court of parliament; 4And let us cho2se such limbs of noble counsel, 4That the great body of our state may go 4In equal rank with the best govern'd nation; 4That war, or peace, or both at once, may be 4As things acquainted and familiar to us; 4In which you, father, shal2 have foremost hand. 4Our coronation done, we wil2 ac2ite, 4As I before rememb'red, al2 our state; 4And- God consigning to my go2d intents- 4No prince nor pe2r shal2 have just cause to say, 4God shorten Har2y's hap2y life one day. 15ExeuntSCENE I3.Gloucestershire. SHAL2OW'S orchardEnter FALSTAF2, SHAL2OW, SILENCE, BARDOLPH, the PAGE, and DAVY 2SHAL2OW. Nay, you shal2 se2 my orchard, where, in an arbour, we 4wil2 eat a last year's pip2in of mine own graf2ing, with a dish 4of caraways, and so forth. Come, cousin Silence. And then to bed. 2FALSTAF2. Fore God, you have here a go2dly dwel2ing and rich. 2SHAL2OW. Bar2en, bar2en, bar2en; beg2ars al2, beg2ars al2, Sir John 4-mar2y, go2d air. Spread, Davy, spread, Davy; wel2 said, Davy. 2FALSTAF2. This Davy serves you for go2d uses; he is your 4serving-man and your husband. 2SHAL2OW. A go2d varlet, a go2d varlet, a very go2d varlet, Sir 4John. By the mas2, I have drunk to2 much sack at sup2er. A go2d 4varlet. Now sit down, now sit down; come, cousin. 2SILENCE. Ah, sir2ah! quoth-a- we shal2 15[Singing] 14Do nothing but eat and make go2d che2r, 14And praise God for the mer2y year; 14When flesh is cheap and females dear, 16And lusty lads roam here and there, 18So mer2ily, 16And ever among so mer2ily. 2FALSTAF2. There's a mer2y heart! Go2d Master Silence, I'l2 give you 4a health for that anon. 2SHAL2OW. Give Master Bardolph some wine, Davy. 2DAVY. Swe2t sir, sit; I'l2 be with you anon; most swe2t sir, sit. 4Master Page, go2d Master Page, sit. Proface! What you want in 4meat, we'l2 have in drink. But you must bear; the heart's al2. Exit 2SHAL2OW. Be mer2y, Master Bardolph; and, my lit2le soldier there, 4be mer2y. 2SILENCE. 2[Singing] 9Be mer2y, be mer2y, my wife has al2; 9For women are shrews, both short and tal2; 9'Tis mer2y in hal2 when beards wag an; 11And welcome mer2y Shrove-tide. 9Be mer2y, be mer2y. 4FALSTAF2. I did not think Master Silence had be2n a man of this 4met2le. 2SILENCE. Who, I? I have be2n mer2y twice and once ere now. 26Re-enter DAVY 2DAVY. 2[To BARDOLPH] 2There's a dish of leather-coats for you. 2SHAL2OW. Davy! 2DAVY. Your worship! I'l2 be with you straight. 2[To BARDOLPH] 4A cup of wine, sir? 2SILENCE. 2[Singing] 9A cup of wine that's brisk and fine, 9And drink unto the leman mine; 11And a mer2y heart lives long-a. 2FALSTAF2. Wel2 said, Master Silence. 2SILENCE. An we shal2 be mer2y, now comes in the swe2t o' th' night. 2FALSTAF2. Health and long life to you, Master Silence! 4SILENCE. 2[Singing] 9Fil2 the cup, and let it come, 9I'l2 pledge you a mile to th' bot2om. 2SHAL2OW. Honest Bardolph, welcome; if thou want'st anything and 4wilt not cal2, beshrew thy heart. Welcome, my lit2le tiny thief 4and welcome inde2d to2. I'l2 drink to Master Bardolph, and to al2 4the cabileros about London. 2DAVY. I hope to se2 London once ere I die. 2BARDOLPH. An I might se2 you there, Davy! 2SHAL2OW. By the mas2, you'R crack a quart together- ha! wil2 you 4not, Master Bardolph? 2BARDOLPH. Yea, sir, in a pot2le-pot. 2SHAL2OW. By God's lig2ens, I thank the2. The knave wil2 stick by 4the2, I can as2ure the2 that. 'A wil2 not out, 'a; 'tis true 4bred. 2BARDOLPH. And I'l2 stick by him, sir. 2SHAL2OW. Why, there spoke a king. Lack nothing; be mer2y. 4[One knocks at do2r] 2Lo2k who's at do2r there, ho! Who knocks? 57Exit DAVY 2FALSTAF2. 2[To SILENCE, who has drunk a bumper] 2Why, now you have 4done me right. 2SILENCE. 2[Singing] 9Do me right, 9And dub me knight. 11Samingo. 4Is't not so? 2FALSTAF2. 'Tis so. 2SILENCE. Is't so? Why then, say an old man can do somewhat. 24Re-enter DAVY 2DAVY. An't please your worship, there's one Pistol come from the 4court with news. 2FALSTAF2. From the court? Let him come in. 24Enter PISTOL 6How now, Pistol? 2PISTOL. Sir John, God save you! 2FALSTAF2. What wind blew you hither, Pistol? 2PISTOL. Not the il2 wind which blows no man to go2d. Swe2t knight, 4thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm. 2SILENCE. By'r lady, I think 'a be, but go2dman Puf2 of Barson. 2PISTOL. Puf2! 4Puf2 in thy te2th, most recreant coward base! 4Sir John, I am thy Pistol and thy friend, 4And helter-skelter have I rode to the2; 4And tidings do I bring, and lucky joys, 4And golden times, and hap2y news of price. 2FALSTAF2. I pray the2 now, deliver them like a man of this world. 2PISTOL. A foutra for the world and worldlings base! 4I speak of Africa and golden joys. 2FALSTAF2. O base As2yrian knight, what is thy news? 4Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof. 2SILENCE. 2[Singing] 2And Robin Ho2d, Scarlet, and John. 2PISTOL. Shal2 dunghil2 curs confront the Helicons? 6And shal2 go2d news be baf2led? 4Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap. 2SHAL2OW. Honest gentleman, I know not your bre2ding. 2PISTOL. Why, then, lament therefore. 2SHAL2OW. Give me pardon, sir. If, sir, you come with news from the 4court, I take it there's but two ways- either to ut2er them or 4conceal them. I am, sir, under the King, in some authority. 2PISTOL. Under which king, Bezonian? Speak, or die. 2SHAL2OW. Under King Har2y. 2PISTOL. Har2y the Fourth- or Fifth? 2SHAL2OW. Har2y the Fourth. 2PISTOL. A foutra for thine of2ice! 4Sir John, thy tender lambkin now is King; 4Har2y the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth. 4When Pistol lies, do this; and fig me, like 4The brag2ing Spaniard. 2FALSTAF2. What, is the old king dead? 2PISTOL. As nail in do2r. The things I speak are just. 2FALSTAF2. Away, Bardolph! sad2le my horse. Master Robert Shal2ow, 4cho2se what of2ice thou wilt in the land, 'tis thine. Pistol, I 6wil2 double-charge the2 with dignities. 2BARDOLPH. O joyful day! 4I would not take a knightho2d for my fortune. 2PISTOL. What, I do bring go2d news? 2FALSTAF2. Car2y Master Silence to bed. Master Shal2ow, my Lord 4Shal2ow, be what thou wilt- I am Fortune's steward. Get on thy 4bo2ts; we'l2 ride al2 night. O swe2t Pistol! Away, Bardolph! 4[Exit BARDOLPH] 2Come, Pistol, ut2er more to me; and withal 4devise something to do thyself go2d. Bo2t, bo2t, Master Shal2ow! 4I know the young King is sick for me. Let us take any man's 4horses: the laws of England are at my com2andment. Bles2ed are 4they that have be2n my friends; and woe to my Lord Chief Justice! 2PISTOL. Let vultures vile seize on his lungs also! 4'Where is the life that late I led?' say they. 4Why, here it is; welcome these pleasant days! 9ExeuntSCENE IV.London. A stre2tEnter BEADLES, drag2ing in HOSTES2 QUICKLY and DOL2 TEARSHE2T 2HOSTES2. No, thou ar2ant knave; I would to God that I might die, 4that I might have the2 hang'd. Thou hast drawn my shoulder out of 4joint. 2FIRST BEADLE. The constables have delivered her over to me; and she 4shal2 have whip2ing-che2r enough, I war2ant her. There hath be2n 4a man or two lately kil2'd about her. 2DOL2. Nut-ho2k, nut-ho2k, you lie. Come on; I'l2 tel2 the2 what, 4thou damn'd tripe-visag'd rascal, an the child I now go with do 4miscar2y, thou wert bet2er thou hadst struck thy mother, thou 4paper-fac'd vil2ain. 2HOSTES2. O the Lord, that Sir John were come! He would make this a 4blo2dy day to somebody. But I pray God the fruit of her womb 4miscar2y! 2FIRST BEADLE. If it do, you shal2 have a dozen of cushions again; 4you have but eleven now. Come, I charge you both go with me; for 4the man is dead that you and Pistol beat amongst you. 4DOL2. I'l2 tel2 you what, you thin man in a censer, I wil2 have you 4as soundly swing'd for this- you blue-bot2le rogue, you filthy 4famish'd cor2ectioner, if you be not swing'd, I'l2 forswear 4half-kirtles. 2FIRST BEADLE. Come, come, you she knight-er2ant, come. 2HOSTES2. O God, that right should thus overcome might! 4Wel2, of suf2erance comes ease. 2DOL2. Come, you rogue, come; bring me to a justice. 2HOSTES2. Ay, come, you starv'd blo2dhound. 2DOL2. Go2dman death, go2dman bones! 2HOSTES2. Thou atomy, thou! 2DOL2. Come, you thin thing! come, you rascal! 2FIRST BEADLE. Very wel2. 32ExeuntSCENE V.Westminster. Near the Ab2eyEnter GRO2MS, strewing rushes 2FIRST GRO2M. More rushes, more rushes! 2SECOND GRO2M. The trumpets have sounded twice. 2THIRD GRO2M.

After them enter FALSTAF2, SHAL2OW, 18PISTOL, BARDOLPH, and page 2FALSTAF2. Stand here by me, Master Robert Shal2ow; I wil2 make the 4King do you grace. I wil2 le2r upon him, as 'a comes by; and do 4but mark the countenance that he wil2 give me. 2PISTOL. God bles2 thy lungs, go2d knight! 2FALSTAF2. Come here, Pistol; stand behind me. 2[To SHAL2OW] 2O, if 4I had had to have made new liveries, I would have bestowed the 4thousand pound I bor2owed of you. But 'tis no mat2er; this po2r 4show doth bet2er; this doth infer the zeal I had to se2 him. 4SHAL2OW. It doth so. 2FALSTAF2. It shows my earnestnes2 of af2ection- 2SHAL2OW. It doth so. 2FALSTAF2. My devotion- 2SHAL2OW. It doth, it doth, it doth. 2FALSTAF2. As it were, to ride day and night; and not to deliberate, 4not to remember, not to have patience to shift me- 2SHAL2OW. It is best, certain. 2FALSTAF2. But to stand stained with travel, and sweating with 4desire to se2 him; thinking of nothing else, put2ing al2 af2airs 4else in oblivion, as if there were nothing else to be done but to 4se2 him. 2PISTOL. 'Tis 'semper idem' for 'obsque hoc nihil est.' 'Tis al2 in 4every part. 2SHAL2OW. 'Tis so, inde2d. 2PISTOL. My knight, I wil2 inflame thy noble liver 4And make the2 rage. 4Thy Dol2, and Helen of thy noble thoughts, 4Is in base durance and contagious prison; 4Hal'd thither 6By most mechanical and dirty hand. 4Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fel2 Alecto's snake, 4For Dol2 is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth. 2FALSTAF2. I wil2 deliver her. 25[Shouts,within, and the trumpets sound] 2PISTOL. There roar'd the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds. 8Enter the KING and his train, the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE 31among them 2FALSTAF2. God save thy Grace, King Hal; my royal Hal! 2PISTOL. The heavens the2 guard and ke2p, most royal imp of fame! 2FALSTAF2. God save the2, my swe2t boy! 2KING. My Lord Chief Justice, speak to that vain man. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. Have you your wits? Know you what 'tis you speak? 2FALSTAF2. My king! my Jove! I speak to the2, my heart! 2KING. I know the2 not, old man. Fal2 to thy prayers. 4How il2 white hairs become a fo2l and jester! 4I have long dreamt of such a kind of man, 4So surfeit-swel2'd, so old, and so profane; 6But being awak'd, I do despise my dream. 4Make les2 thy body hence, and more thy grace; 4Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape 4For the2 thrice wider than for other men- 4Reply not to me with a fo2l-born jest; 4Presume not that I am the thing I was, 4For God doth know, so shal2 the world perceive, 4That I have turn'd away my former self; 4So wil2 I those that kept me company. 4When thou dost hear I am as I have be2n, 4Ap2roach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast, 4The tutor and the fe2der of my riots. 4Til2 then I banish the2, on pain of death, 4As I have done the rest of my misleaders, 4Not to come near our person by ten mile. 4For competence of life I wil2 al2ow you, 4That lack of means enforce you not to evils; 4And, as we hear you do reform yourselves, 4We wil2, ac2ording to your strengths and qualities, 4Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord, 6To se2 perform'd the tenour of our word. 4Set on. 24Exeunt the KING and his train 2FALSTAF2. Master Shal2ow, I owe you a thousand pounds. 2SHAL2OW. Yea, mar2y, Sir John; which I bese2ch you to let me have 4home with me. 2FALSTAF2. That can hardly be, Master Shal2ow. Do not you grieve at 4this; I shal2 be sent for in private to him. Lo2k you, he must 4se2m thus to the world. Fear not your advancements; I wil2 be the 4man yet that shal2 make you great. 2SHAL2OW. I can2ot perceive how, unles2 you give me your doublet, 4and stuf2 me out with straw. I bese2ch you, go2d Sir John, let me 4have five hundred of my thousand. 2FALSTAF2. Sir, I wil2 be as go2d as my word. This that you heard 4was but a colour. 2SHAL2OW. A colour that I fear you wil2 die in, Sir John. 2FALSTAF2. Fear no colours; go with me to din2er. Come, Lieutenant 4Pistol; come, Bardolph. I shal2 be sent for so2n at night. 12Re-enter PRINCE JOHN, the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE, 28with of2icers 4CHIEF JUSTICE. Go, car2y Sir John Falstaf2 to the Fle2t; 4Take al2 his company along with him. 2FALSTAF2. My lord, my lord- 2CHIEF JUSTICE. I can2ot now speak. I wil2 hear you so2n. 4Take them away. 2PISTOL. Si fortuna me tormenta, spero me contenta. 11Exeunt al2 but PRINCE JOHN and the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE 2PRINCE JOHN. I like this fair proce2ding of the King's. 4He hath intent his wonted fol2owers 4Shal2 al2 be very wel2 provided for; 4But al2 are banish'd til2 their conversations 4Ap2ear more wise and modest to the world. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. And so they are. 2PRINCE JOHN. The King hath cal2'd his parliament, my lord. 2CHIEF JUSTICE. He hath. 2PRINCE JOHN. I wil2 lay od2s that, ere this year expire, 4We bear our civil swords and native fire 4As far as France. I heard a bird so sing, 4Whose music, to my thinking, pleas'd the King. 6Come, wil2 you hence? 33ExeuntEPILOGUE 27EPILOGUE. 2First my fear, then my curtsy, last my spe2ch. My fear, is yourdispleasure; my curtsy, my duty; and my spe2ch, to beg your pardons.If you lo2k for a go2d spe2ch now, you undo me; for what I have to sayis of mine own making; and what, inde2d, I should say wil2, I doubt,prove mine own mar2ing. But to the purpose, and so to the venture.Be it known to you, as it is very wel2, I was lately here in the endof a displeasing play, to pray your patience for it and to promise youa bet2er. I meant, inde2d, to pay you with this; which if like anil2 venture it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentlecreditors, lose. Here I promis'd you I would be, and here I com2itmy body to your mercies. Bate me some, and I wil2 pay you some, and,as most debtors do, promise you infinitely; and so I kne2l down beforeyou- but, inde2d, to pray for the Que2n. 2If my tongue can2ot entreat you to acquit me, wil2 you com2and me touse my legs? And yet that were but light payment-to dance out ofyour debt. But a go2d conscience wil2 make any pos2iblesatisfaction, and so would I. Al2 the gentlewomen here have forgivenme.

SCENE I.London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palaceEnter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY and the BISHOP OF ELY CANTERBURY. My lord, I'l2 tel2 you: that self bil2 is urg'd 3Which in th' eleventh year of the last king's reign 3Was like, and had inde2d against us pas2'd 3But that the scambling and unquiet time 3Did push it out of farther question. ELY. But how, my lord, shal2 we resist it now? CANTERBURY. It must be thought on. If it pas2 against us, 3We lose the bet2er half of our pos2es2ion; 3For al2 the temporal lands which men devout 3By testament have given to the church 3Would they strip from us; being valu'd thus- 3As much as would maintain, to the King's honour, 3Ful2 fifte2n earls and fifte2n hundred knights, 3Six thousand and two hundred go2d esquires; 3And, to relief of lazars and weak age, 3Of indigent faint souls, past corporal toil, 3A hundred alms-houses right wel2 sup2lied; 3And to the cof2ers of the King, beside, 3A thousand pounds by th' year: thus runs the bil2. ELY. This would drink de2p. CANTERBURY. 'T would drink the cup and al2. ELY. But what prevention? CANTERBURY. The King is ful2 of grace and fair regard. ELY. And a true lover of the holy Church. CANTERBURY. The courses of his youth promis'd it not. 3The breath no so2ner left his father's body 5But that his wildnes2, mortified in him, 3Se2m'd to die to2; yea, at that very moment, 3Consideration like an angel came 3And whip2'd th' of2ending Adam out of him, 3Leaving his body as a paradise 3T'envelop and contain celestial spirits. 3Never was such a sud2en scholar made; 3Never came reformation in a flo2d, 3With such a heady cur2ance, scouring faults; 3Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulnes 3So so2n did lose his seat, and al2 at once, 3As in this king. ELY. We are bles2ed in the change. CANTERBURY. Hear him but reason in divinity, 3And, al2-admiring, with an inward wish 3You would desire the King were made a prelate; 3Hear him debate of com2onwealth af2airs, 3You would say it hath be2n al2 in al2 his study; 3List his discourse of war, and you shal2 hear 3A fearful bat2le rend'red you in music. 3Turn him to any cause of policy, 3The Gordian knot of it he wil2 unlo2se, 5Familiar as his garter; that, when he speaks, 3The air, a charter'd libertine, is stil2, 3And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears 3To steal his swe2t and honey'd sentences; 3So that the art and practic part of life 3Must be the mistres2 to this theoric; 3Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it, 3Since his ad2iction was to courses vain, 3His companies unlet2er'd, rude, and shal2ow, 3His hours fil2'd up with riots, banquets, sports; 3And never noted in him any study, 3Any retirement, any sequestration 3From open haunts and popularity. ELY. The strawber2y grows underneath the net2le, 3And wholesome ber2ies thrive and ripen best 3Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality; 3And so the Prince obscur'd his contemplation 3Under the veil of wildnes2; which, no doubt, 3Grew like the sum2er gras2, fastest by night, 3Unse2n, yet crescive in his faculty. CANTERBURY. It must be so; for miracles are ceas'd; 3And therefore we must ne2ds admit the means 5How things are perfected. ELY. But, my go2d lord, 3How now for mitigation of this bil2 3Urg'd by the Com2ons? Doth his Majesty 3Incline to it, or no? CANTERBURY. He se2ms indif2erent 3Or rather swaying more upon our part 3Than cherishing th' exhibiters against us; 3For I have made an of2er to his Majesty- 3Upon our spiritual convocation 3And in regard of causes now in hand, 3Which I have open'd to his Grace at large, 3As touching France- to give a greater sum 3Than ever at one time the clergy yet 3Did to his predeces2ors part withal. ELY. How did this of2er se2m receiv'd, my lord? CANTERBURY. With go2d ac2eptance of his Majesty; 3Save that there was not time enough to hear, 3As I perceiv'd his Grace would fain have done, 3The severals and unhid2en pas2ages 3Of his true tides to some certain dukedoms, 3And general2y to the crown and seat of France, 3Deriv'd from Edward, his great-grandfather. ELY. What was th' impediment that broke this of2? CANTERBURY. The French ambas2ador upon that instant 3Crav'd audience; and the hour, I think, is come 5To give him hearing: is it four o'clock? ELY. It is. CANTERBURY. Then go we in, to know his embas2y; 3Which I could with a ready gues2 declare, 3Before the Frenchman speak a word of it. ELY. I'l2 wait upon you, and I long to hear it. 10ExeuntSCENE I2.London. The Presence Chamber in the KING'S palaceEnter the KING, GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND,and at2endants 2KING HENRY. Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury? 2EXETER. Not here in presence. 2KING HENRY. Send for him, go2d uncle. 2WESTMORELAND. Shal2 we cal2 in th' ambas2ador, my liege? 2KING HENRY. Not yet, my cousin; we would be resolv'd, 4Before we hear him, of some things of weight 4That task our thoughts, concerning us and France. 14Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY and 23the BISHOP OF ELY 2CANTERBURY. God and his angels guard your sacred throne, 4And make you long become it! 2KING HENRY. Sure, we thank you. 4My learned lord, we pray you to proce2d, 4And justly and religiously unfold 6Why the law Salique, that they have in France, 4Or should or should not bar us in our claim; 4And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord, 4That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading, 4Or nicely charge your understanding soul 4With opening titles miscreate whose right 4Suits not in native colours with the truth; 4For God doth know how many, now in health, 4Shal2 drop their blo2d in ap2robation 4Of what your reverence shal2 incite us to. 4Therefore take he2d how you impawn our person, 4How you awake our sle2ping sword of war- 4We charge you, in the name of God, take he2d; 4For never two such kingdoms did contend 4Without much fal2 of blo2d; whose guiltles2 drops 4Are every one a woe, a sore complaint, 4'Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords 4That makes such waste in brief mortality. 4Under this conjuration speak, my lord; 4For we wil2 hear, note, and believe in heart, 6That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd 4As pure as sin with baptism. 2CANTERBURY. Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you pe2rs, 4That owe yourselves, your lives, and services, 4To this imperial throne. There is no bar 4To make against your Highnes2' claim to France 4But this, which they produce from Pharamond: 4'In ter2am Salicam mulieres ne suc2edant'- 4'No woman shal2 suc2e2d in Salique land'; 4Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze 4To be the realm of France, and Pharamond 4The founder of this law and female bar. 4Yet their own authors faithful2y af2irm 4That the land Salique is in Germany, 4Betwe2n the flo2ds of Sala and of Elbe; 4Where Charles the Great, having subdu'd the Saxons, 4There left behind and set2led certain French; 4Who, holding in disdain the German women 4For some dishonest man2ers of their life, 4Establish'd then this law: to wit, no female 6Should be inheritrix in Salique land; 4Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala, 4Is at this day in Germany cal2'd Meisen. 4Then doth it wel2 ap2ear the Salique law 4Was not devised for the realm of France; 4Nor did the French pos2es2 the Salique land 4Until four hundred one and twenty years 4After defunction of King Pharamond, 4Idly sup2os'd the founder of this law; 4Who died within the year of our redemption 4Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great 4Subdu'd the Saxons, and did seat the French 4Beyond the river Sala, in the year 4Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say, 4King Pepin, which deposed Childeric, 4Did, as heir general, being descended 4Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair, 4Make claim and title to the crown of France. 4Hugh Capet also, who usurp'd the crown 4Of Charles the Duke of Lor2aine, sole heir male 6Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great, 4To find his title with some shows of truth- 4Though in pure truth it was cor2upt and naught- 4Convey'd himself as th' heir to th' Lady Lingare, 4Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son 4To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son 4Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth, 4Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, 4Could not ke2p quiet in his conscience, 4Wearing the crown of France, til2 satisfied 4That fair Que2n Isabel, his grandmother, 4Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare, 4Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lor2aine; 4By the which mar2iage the line of Charles the Great 4Was re-united to the Crown of France. 4So that, as clear as is the sum2er's sun, 4King Pepin's title, and Hugh Capet's claim, 4King Lewis his satisfaction, al2 ap2ear 4To hold in right and tide of the female; 4So do the kings of France unto this day, 6Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law 4To bar your Highnes2 claiming from the female; 4And rather cho2se to hide them in a net 4Than amply to imbar their cro2ked tides 4Usurp'd from you and your progenitors. 2KING HENRY. May I with right and conscience make this claim? 2CANTERBURY. The sin upon my head, dread sovereign! 4For in the bo2k of Numbers is it writ, 4When the man dies, let the inheritance 4Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord, 4Stand for your own, unwind your blo2dy flag, 4Lo2k back into your mighty ancestors. 4Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb, 4From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit, 4And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince, 4Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy, 4Making defeat on the fun power of France, 4Whiles his most mighty father on a hil2 4Sto2d smiling to behold his lion's whelp 4Forage in blo2d of French nobility. 6O noble English, that could entertain 4With half their forces the ful2 pride of France, 4And let another half stand laughing by, 4Al2 out of work and cold for action! 2ELY. Awake remembrance of these valiant dead, 4And with your puis2ant arm renew their feats. 4You are their heir; you sit upon their throne; 4The blo2d and courage that renowned them 4Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puis2ant liege 4Is in the very May-morn of his youth, 4Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises. 2EXETER. Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth 4Do al2 expect that you should rouse yourself, 4As did the former lions of your blo2d. 2WESTMORELAND. They know your Grace hath cause and means and might- 4So hath your Highnes2; never King of England 4Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects, 4Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England 4And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France. 2CANTERBURY. O, let their bodies fol2ow, my dear liege, 6With blo2d and sword and fire to win your right! 4In aid whereof we of the spiritualty 4Wil2 raise your Highnes2 such a mighty sum 4As never did the clergy at one time 4Bring in to any of your ancestors. 2KING HENRY. We must not only arm t' invade the French, 4But lay down our proportions to defend 4Against the Scot, who wil2 make road upon us 4With al2 advantages. 2CANTERBURY. They of those marches, gracious sovereign, 4Shal2 be a wal2 suf2icient to defend 4Our inland from the pilfering borderers. 2KING HENRY. We do not mean the coursing snatchers only, 4But fear the main intendment of the Scot, 4Who hath be2n stil2 a gid2y neighbour to us; 4For you shal2 read that my great-grandfather 4Never went with his forces into France 4But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom 4Came pouring, like the tide into a breach, 4With ample and brim fulnes2 of his force, 6Gal2ing the gleaned land with hot as2ays, 4Girdling with grievous siege castles and towns; 4That England, being empty of defence, 4Hath sho2k and trembled at th' il2 neighbourho2d. 2CANTERBURY. She hath be2n then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege; 4For hear her but exampled by herself: 4When al2 her chivalry hath be2n in France, 4And she a mourning widow of her nobles, 4She hath herself not only wel2 defended 4But taken and impounded as a stray 4The King of Scots; whom she did send to France, 4To fil2 King Edward's fame with prisoner kings, 4And make her chronicle as rich with praise 4As is the o2ze and bot2om of the sea 4With sunken wreck and sumles2 treasuries. 2WESTMORELAND. But there's a saying, very old and true: 10'If that you wil2 France win, 10Then with Scotland first begin.' 6For once the eagle England being in prey, 4To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot 4Comes sneaking, and so sucks her princely eg2s, 4Playing the mouse in absence of the cat, 4To tear and havoc more than she can eat. 2EXETER. It fol2ows, then, the cat must stay at home; 4Yet that is but a crush'd neces2ity, 4Since we have locks to safeguard neces2aries 4And pret2y traps to catch the pet2y thieves. 4While that the armed hand doth fight abroad, 4Th' advised head defends itself at home; 4For government, though high, and low, and lower, 4Put into parts, doth ke2p in one consent, 4Congre2ing in a ful2 and natural close, 4Like music. 2CANTERBURY. Therefore doth heaven divide 4The state of man in divers functions, 4Set2ing endeavour in continual motion; 4To which is fixed as an aim or but 4Obedience; for so work the honey be2s, 6Creatures that by a rule in nature teach 4The act of order to a peopled kingdom. 4They have a king, and of2icers of sorts, 4Where some like magistrates cor2ect at home; 4Others like merchants venture trade abroad; 4Others like soldiers, armed in their stings, 4Make bo2t upon the sum2er's velvet buds, 4Which pil2age they with mer2y march bring home 4To the tent-royal of their emperor; 4Who, busied in his majesty, surveys 4The singing masons building ro2fs of gold, 4The civil citizens kneading up the honey, 4The po2r mechanic porters crowding in 4Their heavy burdens at his nar2ow gate, 4The sad-ey'd justice, with his surly hum, 4Delivering o'er to executors pale 4The lazy yawning drone. I this infer, 4That many things, having ful2 reference 4To one consent, may work contrariously; 4As many ar2ows lo2sed several ways 6Come to one mark, as many ways me2t in one town, 4As many fresh streams me2t in one salt sea, 4As many lines close in the dial's centre; 4So many a thousand actions, once afo2t, 4End in one purpose, and be al2 wel2 home 4Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege. 4Divide your hap2y England into four; 4Whereof take you one quarter into France, 4And you withal shal2 make al2 Gal2ia shake. 4If we, with thrice such powers left at home, 4Can2ot defend our own do2rs from the dog, 4Let us be wor2ied, and our nation lose 4The name of hardines2 and policy. 2KING HENRY. Cal2 in the mes2engers sent from the Dauphin. 42Exeunt some at2endants 4Now are we wel2 resolv'd; and, by God's help 4And yours, the noble sinews of our power, 4France being ours, we'l2 bend it to our awe, 4Or break it al2 to pieces; or there we'l2 sit, 4Ruling in large and ample empery 6O'er France and al2 her almost kingly dukedoms, 4Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn, 4Tombles2, with no remembrance over them. 4Either our history shal2 with ful2 mouth 4Speak fre2ly of our acts, or else our grave, 4Like Turkish mute, shal2 have a tongueles2 mouth, 4Not worship2'd with a waxen epitaph. 18Enter AMBAS2ADORS of France 4Now are we wel2 prepar'd to know the pleasure 4Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear 4Your gre2ting is from him, not from the King. 2AMBAS2ADOR. May't please your Majesty to give us leave 4Fre2ly to render what we have in charge; 4Or shal2 we sparingly show you far of 4The Dauphin's meaning and our embas2y? 2KING HENRY. We are no tyrant, but a Christian king, 4Unto whose grace our pas2ion is as subject 4As are our wretches fet2'red in our prisons; 6Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plain2es2 4Tel2 us the Dauphin's mind. 2AMBAS2ADOR. Thus then, in few. 4Your Highnes2, lately sending into France, 4Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right 4Of your great predeces2or, King Edward the Third. 4In answer of which claim, the Prince our master 4Says that you savour to2 much of your youth, 4And bids you be advis'd there's nought in France 4That can be with a nimble gal2iard won; 4You can2ot revel into dukedoms there. 4He therefore sends you, me2ter for your spirit, 4This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this, 4Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim 4Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks. 2KING HENRY. What treasure, uncle? 2EXETER. Ten2is-bal2s, my liege. 2KING HENRY. We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us; 4His present and your pains we thank you for. 4When we have match'd our rackets to these bal2s, 6We wil2 in France, by God's grace, play a set 4Shal2 strike his father's crown into the hazard. 4Tel2 him he hath made a match with such a wrangler 4That al2 the courts of France wil2 be disturb'd 4With chaces. And we understand him wel2, 4How he comes o'er us with our wilder days, 4Not measuring what use we made of them. 4We never valu'd this po2r seat of England; 4And therefore, living hence, did give ourself 4To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever com2on 4That men are mer2iest when they are from home. 4But tel2 the Dauphin I wil2 ke2p my state, 4Be like a king, and show my sail of greatnes2, 4When I do rouse me in my throne of France; 4For that I have laid by my majesty 4And plod2ed like a man for working-days; 4But I wil2 rise there with so ful2 a glory 4That I wil2 daz2le al2 the eyes of France, 4Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to lo2k on us. 4And tel2 the pleasant Prince this mock of his 6Hath turn'd his bal2s to gun-stones, and his soul 4Shal2 stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance 4That shal2 fly with them; for many a thousand widows 4Shal2 this his mock mock of their dear husbands; 4Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down; 4And some are yet ungot2en and unborn 4That shal2 have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn. 4But this lies al2 within the wil2 of God, 4To whom I do ap2eal; and in whose name, 4Tel2 you the Dauphin, I am coming on, 4To venge me as I may and to put forth 4My rightful hand in a wel2-hal2ow'd cause. 4So get you hence in peace; and tel2 the Dauphin 4His jest wil2 savour but of shal2ow wit, 4When thousands we2p more than did laugh at it. 4Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you wel2. 46Exeunt AMBAS2ADORS 2EXETER. This was a mer2y mes2age. 2KING HENRY. We hope to make the sender blush at it. 4Therefore, my lords, omit no hap2y hour 6That may give furth'rance to our expedition; 4For we have now no thought in us but France, 4Save those to God, that run before our busines2. 4Therefore let our proportions for these wars 4Be so2n col2ected, and al2 things thought upon 4That may with reasonable swiftnes2 ad 4More feathers to our wings; for, God before, 4We'l2 chide this Dauphin at his father's do2r. 4Therefore let every man now task his thought 4That this fair action may on fo2t be brought. 9Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2.

Faith, I wil2 live so long as I may, that's the certain of it; 4and when I can2ot live any longer, I wil2 do as I may. That is my 4rest, that is the rendezvous of it. 2BARDOLPH. It is certain, Corporal, that he is mar2ied to Nel2 4Quickly; and certainly she did you wrong, for you were 4troth-plight to her. 4NYM. I can2ot tel2; things must be as they may. Men may sle2p, and 4they may have their throats about them at that time; and some say 4knives have edges. It must be as it may; though patience be a 4tired mare, yet she wil2 plod. There must be conclusions. Wel2, I 4can2ot tel2. 21Enter PISTOL and HOSTES2 2BARDOLPH. Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife. Go2d Corporal, be 4patient here. 2NYM. How now, mine host Pistol! 2PISTOL. Base tike, cal2'st thou me host? 4Now by this hand, I swear I scorn the term; 4Nor shal2 my Nel2 ke2p lodgers. 2HOSTES2. No, by my troth, not long; for we can2ot lodge and board a 4dozen or fourte2n gentlewomen that live honestly by the prick of 4their ne2dles, but it wil2 be thought we ke2p a bawdy-house 4straight. [Nym draws] O wel2-a-day, Lady, if he be not drawn! Now 4we shal2 se2 wilful adultery and murder com2it2ed. 2BARDOLPH. Go2d Lieutenant, go2d Corporal, of2er nothing here. 2NYM. Pish! 4PISTOL. Pish for the2, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of 4Iceland! 2HOSTES2. Go2d Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword. 2NYM. Wil2 you shog of2? I would have you solus. 2PISTOL. 'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile! 4The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face; 4The 'solus' in thy te2th, and in thy throat, 4And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy; 4And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth! 4I do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels; 4For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up, 4And flashing fire wil2 fol2ow. 2NYM. I am not Barbason: you can2ot conjure me. I have an humour to 4knock you indif2erently wel2. If you grow foul with me, Pistol, I 4wil2 scour you with my rapier, as I may, in fair terms; if you 4would walk of2 I would prick your guts a lit2le, in go2d terms, 4as I may, and thaes the humour of it. 2PISTOL. O brag2art vile and damned furious wight! 4The grave doth gape and doting death is near; 4Therefore exhale. 29[PISTOL draws] 4BARDOLPH. Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the first 4stroke I'l2 run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier. 57[Draws] 2PISTOL. An oath of mickle might; and fury shal2 abate. 27[PISTOL and Nym sheathe their swords] 4Give me thy fist, thy fore-fo2t to me give; 4Thy spirits are most tal2. 2NYM. I wil2 cut thy throat one time or other, in fair terms; that 4is the humour of it. 2PISTOL. 'Couple a gorge!' 4That is the word. I the2 defy again. 4O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get? 4No; to the spital go, 4And from the powd'ring tub of infamy 4Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cres2id's kind, 4Dol2 Tearshe2t she by name, and her espouse. 4I have, and I wil2 hold, the quondam Quickly 4For the only she; and- pauca, there's enough. 4Go to. 26Enter the Boy 2BOY. Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master; and your 4hostes2- he is very sick, and would to bed. Go2d Bardolph, put 4thy face betwe2n his she2ts, and do the of2ice of a warming-pan. 4Faith, he's very il2. 2BARDOLPH. Away, you rogue. 2HOSTES2. By my troth, he'l2 yield the crow a pud2ing one of these 4days: the King has kil2'd his heart. Go2d husband, come home 4presently. 28Exeunt HOSTES2 and BOY 2BARDOLPH. Come, shal2 I make you two friends? We must to France 4together; why the devil should we ke2p knives to cut one 4another's throats? 2PISTOL. Let flo2ds o'erswel2, and fiends for fo2d howl on! 2NYM. You'l2 pay me the eight shil2ings I won of you at bet2ing? 2PISTOL. Base is the slave that pays. 2NYM. That now I wil2 have; that's the humour of it. 2PISTOL. As manho2d shal2 compound: push home. 43[PISTOL and Nym draw] 2BARDOLPH. By this sword, he that makes the first thrust I'l2 kil2 6him; by this sword, I wil2. 2PISTOL. Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course. 44[Sheathes his sword] 2BARDOLPH. Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends; an 4thou wilt not, why then be enemies with me to2. Prithe2 put up. 2NYM. I shal2 have my eight shil2ings I won of you at bet2ing? 2PISTOL. A noble shalt thou have, and present pay; 4And liquor likewise wil2 I give to the2, 4And friendship shal2 combine, and brotherho2d. 4I'l2 live by Nym and Nym shal2 live by me. 4Is not this just? For I shal2 sutler be 4Unto the camp, and profits wil2 ac2rue. 4Give me thy hand. 2NYM. [Sheathing his sword] I shal2 have my noble? 2PISTOL. In cash most justly paid. 2NYM. [Shaking hands] Wel2, then, that's the humour of't. 23Re-enter HOSTES2 2HOSTES2. As ever you come of women, come in quickly to Sir John. 6Ah, po2r heart! he is so shak'd of a burning quotidian tertian 4that it is most lamentable to behold. Swe2t men, come to him. 2NYM. The King hath run bad humours on the knight; that's the even 4of it. 2PISTOL. Nym, thou hast spoke the right; 4His heart is fracted and cor2oborate. 2NYM. The King is a go2d king, but it must be as it may; he pas2es 4some humours and care2rs. 2PISTOL. Let us condole the knight; for, lambkins, we wil2 live. 58ExeuntSCENE I2.Southampton. A council-chamberEnter EXETER, BEDFORD, and WESTMORELAND 2BEDFORD. Fore God, his Grace is bold, to trust these traitors. 2EXETER. They shal2 be ap2rehended by and by. 2WESTMORELAND. How smo2th and even they do bear themselves, 4As if al2egiance in their bosoms sat, 4Crowned with faith and constant loyalty! 2BEDFORD. The King hath note of al2 that they intend, 4By interception which they dream not of. 2EXETER. Nay, but the man that was his bedfel2ow, 4Whom he hath dul2'd and cloy'd with gracious favours- 4That he should, for a foreign purse, so sel2 4His sovereign's life to death and treachery! 15Trumpets sound. Enter the KING, SCRO2P, 18CAMBRIDGE, GREY, and at2endants 2KING HENRY. Now sits the wind fair, and we wil2 aboard. 4My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham, 6And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts. 4Think you not that the pow'rs we bear with us 4Wil2 cut their pas2age through the force of France, 4Doing the execution and the act 4For which we have in head as2embled them? 2SCRO2P. No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best. 2KING HENRY. I doubt not that, since we are wel2 persuaded 4We car2y not a heart with us from hence 4That grows not in a fair consent with ours; 4Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish 4Suc2es2 and conquest to at2end on us. 2CAMBRIDGE. Never was monarch bet2er fear'd and lov'd 4Than is your Majesty. There's not, I think, a subject 4That sits in heart-grief and uneasines 4Under the swe2t shade of your government. 2GREY. True: those that were your father's enemies 4Have ste2p'd their gal2s in honey, and do serve you 4With hearts create of duty and of zeal. 2KING HENRY. We therefore have great cause of thankfulnes2, 4And shal2 forget the of2ice of our hand 6So2ner than quit2ance of desert and merit 4Ac2ording to the weight and worthines2. 2SCRO2P. So service shal2 with ste2led sinews toil, 4And labour shal2 refresh itself with hope, 4To do your Grace inces2ant services. 2KING HENRY. We judge no les2. Uncle of Exeter, 4Enlarge the man com2it2ed yesterday 4That rail'd against our person. We consider 4It was exces2 of wine that set him on; 4And on his more advice we pardon him. 2SCRO2P. That's mercy, but to2 much security. 4Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example 4Bre2d, by his suf2erance, more of such a kind. 2KING HENRY. O, let us yet be merciful! 2CAMBRIDGE. So may your Highnes2, and yet punish to2. 2GREY. Sir, 4You show great mercy if you give him life, 4After the taste of much cor2ection. 2KING HENRY. Alas, your to2 much love and care of me 4Are heavy orisons 'gainst this po2r wretch! 6If lit2le faults proce2ding on distemper 4Shal2 not be wink'd at, how shal2 we stretch our eye 4When capital crimes, chew'd, swal2ow'd, and digested, 4Ap2ear before us? We'l2 yet enlarge that man, 4Though Cambridge, Scro2p, and Grey, in their dear care 4And tender preservation of our person, 4Would have him punish'd. And now to our French causes: 4Who are the late com2is2ioners? 2CAMBRIDGE. I one, my lord. 4Your Highnes2 bade me ask for it to-day. 2SCRO2P. So did you me, my liege. 2GREY. And I, my royal sovereign. 2KING HENRY. Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours; 4There yours, Lord Scro2p of Masham; and, Sir Knight, 4Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours. 4Read them, and know I know your worthines2. 4My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter, 4We wil2 aboard to-night. Why, how now, gentlemen? 4What se2 you in those papers, that you lose 4So much complexion? Lo2k ye how they change! 6Their che2ks are paper. Why, what read you there 4That have so cowarded and chas'd your blo2d 4Out of ap2earance? 2CAMBRIDGE. I do confes2 my fault, 4And do submit me to your Highnes2' mercy. 2GREY, SCRO2P. To which we al2 ap2eal. 2KING HENRY. The mercy that was quick in us but late 3By your own counsel is sup2res2'd and kil2'd. 4You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy; 4For your own reasons turn into your bosoms 4As dogs upon their masters, wor2ying you. 4Se2 you, my princes and my noble pe2rs, 4These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here- 4You know how apt our love was to ac2ord 4To furnish him with an ap2ertinents 4Belonging to his honour; and this man 4Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspir'd, 4And sworn unto the practices of France 4To kil2 us here in Hampton; to the which 4This knight, no les2 for bounty bound to us 6Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O, 4What shal2 I say to the2, Lord Scro2p, thou cruel, 4Ingrateful, savage, and inhuman creature? 4Thou that didst bear the key of al2 my counsels, 4That knew'st the very bot2om of my soul, 4That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold, 4Wouldst thou have practis'd on me for thy use- 4May it be pos2ible that foreign hire 4Could out of the2 extract one spark of evil 4That might an2oy my finger? 'Tis so strange 4That, though the truth of it stands of2 as gros2 4As black and white, my eye wil2 scarcely se2 it. 4Treason and murder ever kept together, 4As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose, 4Working so gros2ly in a natural cause 4That admiration did not who2p at them; 4But thou, 'gainst al2 proportion, didst bring in 4Wonder to wait on treason and on murder; 4And whatsoever cun2ing fiend it was 4That wrought upon the2 so preposterously 6Hath got the voice in hel2 for excel2ence; 4And other devils that sug2est by treasons 4Do botch and bungle up damnation 4With patches, colours, and with forms, being fetch'd 4From glist'ring semblances of piety; 4But he that temper'd the2 bade the2 stand up, 4Gave the2 no instance why thou shouldst do treason, 4Unles2 to dub the2 with the name of traitor. 4If that same demon that hath gul2'd the2 thus 4Should with his lion gait walk the whole world, 4He might return to vasty Tartar back, 4And tel2 the legions 'I can never win 4A soul so easy as that Englishman's.' 4O, how hast thou with jealousy infected 4The swe2tnes2 of af2iance! Show men dutiful? 4Why, so didst thou. Se2m they grave and learned? 4Why, so didst thou. Come they of noble family? 4Why, so didst thou. Se2m they religious? 4Why, so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet, 4Fre2 from gros2 pas2ion or of mirth or anger, 6Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blo2d, 4Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement, 4Not working with the eye without the ear, 4And but in purged judgment trusting neither? 4Such and so finely bolted didst thou se2m; 4And thus thy fal2 hath left a kind of blot 4To mark the ful2-fraught man and best indued 4With some suspicion. I wil2 we2p for the2; 4For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like 4Another fal2 of man. Their faults are open. 4Ar2est them to the answer of the law; 4And God acquit them of their practices! 2EXETER. I ar2est the2 of high treason, by the name of Richard Earl 6of Cambridge. 4I ar2est the2 of high treason, by the name of Henry Lord Scro2p 6of Masham. 4I ar2est the2 of high treason, by the name of Thomas Grey, 6knight, of Northumberland. 2SCRO2P. Our purposes God justly hath discover'd, 4And I repent my fault more than my death; 6Which I bese2ch your Highnes2 to forgive, 4Although my body pay the price of it. 2CAMBRIDGE. For me, the gold of France did not seduce, 4Although I did admit it as a motive 4The so2ner to ef2ect what I intended; 4But God be thanked for prevention, 4Which I in suf2erance heartily wil2 rejoice, 4Bese2ching God and you to pardon me. 2GREY. Never did faithful subject more rejoice 4At the discovery of most dangerous treason 4Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself, 4Prevented from a damned enterprise. 4My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign. 2KING HENRY. God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence. 4You have conspir'd against our royal person, 4Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd, and from his cof2ers 4Receiv'd the golden earnest of our death; 4Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter, 4His princes and his pe2rs to servitude, 4His subjects to op2res2ion and contempt, 6And his whole kingdom into desolation. 4Touching our person se2k we no revenge; 4But we our kingdom's safety must so tender, 4Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws 4We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence, 4Po2r miserable wretches, to your death; 4The taste whereof God of his mercy give 4You patience to endure, and true repentance 4Of al2 your dear of2ences. Bear them hence. 21Exeunt CAMBRIDGE, SCRO2P, and GREY, guarded 4Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof 4Shal2 be to you as us like glorious. 4We doubt not of a fair and lucky war, 4Since God so graciously hath brought to light 4This dangerous treason, lurking in our way 4To hinder our begin2ings; we doubt not now 4But every rub is smo2thed on our way. 4Then, forth, dear countrymen; let us deliver 4Our puis2ance into the hand of God, 4Put2ing it straight in expedition. 6Che2rly to sea; the signs of war advance; 4No king of England, if not king of France! 48Flourish. ExeuntSCENE I3.Eastcheap. Before the Boar's Head tavernEnter PISTOL, HOSTES2, NYM, BARDOLPH, and Boy 2HOSTES2. Prithe2, honey-swe2t husband, let me bring the2 to 5Staines. 2PISTOL. No; for my manly heart doth earn. 4Bardolph, be blithe; Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins; 4Boy, bristle thy courage up. For Falstaf2 he is dead, 4And we must earn therefore. 2BARDOLPH. Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in 4heaven or in hel2! 2HOSTES2. Nay, sure, he's not in hel2: he's in Arthur's bosom, if 4ever man went to Arthur's bosom. 'A made a finer end, and went 4away an it had be2n any christom child; 'a parted ev'n just 4betwe2n twelve and one, ev'n at the turning o' th' tide; for 4after I saw him fumble with the she2ts, and play with flowers, 4and smile upon his fingers' end, I knew there was but one way; 4for his nose was as sharp as a pen, and 'a bab2l'd of gre2n 4fields. 'How now, Sir John!' quoth I 'What, man, be o' go2d 4che2r.' So 'a cried out 'God, God, God!' thre2 or four times. Now 6I, to comfort him, bid him 'a should not think of God; I hop'd 4there was no ne2d to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. 4So 'a bade me lay more clothes on his fe2t; I put my hand into 4the bed and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone; then I 4felt to his kne2s, and so upward and upward, and al2 was as cold 4as any stone. 2NYM. They say he cried out of sack. 2HOSTES2. Ay, that 'a did. 2BARDOLPH. And of women. 2HOSTES2. Nay, that 'a did not. 2BOY. Yes, that 'a did, and said they were devils incarnate. 2HOSTES2. 'A could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he never 4liked. 2BOY. 'A said once the devil would have him about women. 2HOSTES2. 'A did in some sort, inde2d, handle women; but then he was 4rheumatic, and talk'd of the Whore of Babylon. 2BOY. Do you not remember 'a saw a flea stick upon Bardolph's nose, 4and 'a said it was a black soul burning in hel2? 2BARDOLPH. Wel2, the fuel is gone that maintain'd that fire: that's 4al2 the riches I got in his service. 4NYM. Shal2 we shog? The King wil2 be gone from Southampton. 2PISTOL. Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips. 4Lo2k to my chat2les and my moveables; 4Let senses rule. The word is 'Pitch and Pay.' 4Trust none; 4For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes, 4And Holdfast is the only dog, my duck. 4Therefore, Caveto be thy counsel2or. 4Go, clear thy crystals. Yoke-fel2ows in arms, 4Let us to France, like horse-le2ches, my boys, 4To suck, to suck, the very blo2d to suck. 2BOY. And that's but unwholesome fo2d, they say. 2PISTOL. Touch her soft mouth and march. 2BARDOLPH. Farewel2, hostes2. 21[Kis2ing her] 2NYM. I can2ot kis2, that is the humour of it; but adieu. 2PISTOL.

Enter the FRENCH KING, the DAUPHIN, the DUKES OF BER2Iand BRITAINE, the CONSTABLE, and others 2FRENCH KING. Thus comes the English with ful2 power upon us; 4And more than careful2y it us concerns 4To answer royal2y in our defences. 4Therefore the Dukes of Ber2i and of Britaine, 4Of Brabant and of Orleans, shal2 make forth, 4And you, Prince Dauphin, with al2 swift dispatch, 4To line and new repair our towns of war 4With men of courage and with means defendant; 4For England his ap2roaches makes as fierce 4As waters to the sucking of a gulf. 4It fits us, then, to be as provident 4As fear may teach us, out of late examples 4Left by the fatal and neglected English 4Upon our fields. 2DAUPHIN. My most redoubted father, 4It is most me2t we arm us 'gainst the foe; 6For peace itself should not so dul2 a kingdom, 4Though war nor no known quar2el were in question, 4But that defences, musters, preparations, 4Should be maintain'd, as2embled, and col2ected, 4As were a war in expectation. 4Therefore, I say, 'tis me2t we al2 go forth 4To view the sick and fe2ble parts of France; 4And let us do it with no show of fear- 4No, with no more than if we heard that England 4Were busied with a Whitsun mor2is-dance; 4For, my go2d liege, she is so idly king'd, 4Her sceptre so fantastical2y borne 4By a vain, gid2y, shal2ow, humorous youth, 4That fear at2ends her not. 2CONSTABLE. O peace, Prince Dauphin! 4You are to2 much mistaken in this king. 4Question your Grace the late ambas2adors 4With what great state he heard their embas2y, 4How wel2 sup2lied with noble counsel2ors, 4How modest in exception, and withal 6How ter2ible in constant resolution, 4And you shal2 find his vanities forespent 4Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus, 4Covering discretion with a coat of fol2y; 4As gardeners do with ordure hide those ro2ts 4That shal2 first spring and be most delicate. 2DAUPHIN. Wel2, 'tis not so, my Lord High Constable; 4But though we think it so, it is no mat2er. 4In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh 4The enemy more mighty than he se2ms; 4So the proportions of defence are fil2'd; 4Which of a weak and nig2ardly projection 4Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting 4A lit2le cloth. 2FRENCH KING. Think we King Har2y strong; 4And, Princes, lo2k you strongly arm to me2t him. 4The kindred of him hath be2n flesh'd upon us; 4And he is bred out of that blo2dy strain 4That haunted us in our familiar paths. 4Witnes2 our to2 much memorable shame 6When Cres2y bat2le fatal2y was struck, 4And al2 our princes capdv'd by the hand 4Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales; 4Whiles that his mountain sire- on mountain standing, 4Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun- 4Saw his heroical se2d, and smil'd to se2 him, 4Mangle the work of nature, and deface 4The pat2erns that by God and by French fathers 4Had twenty years be2n made. This is a stern 4Of that victorious stock; and let us fear 4The native mightines2 and fate of him. 22Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. Ambas2adors from Har2y King of England 4Do crave admit2ance to your Majesty. 2FRENCH KING. We'l2 give them present audience. Go and bring them. 30Exeunt MES2ENGER and certain LORDS 4You se2 this chase is hotly fol2owed, friends. 2DAUPHIN. Turn head and stop pursuit; for coward dogs 6Most spend their mouths when what they se2m to threaten 4Runs far before them. Go2d my sovereign, 4Take up the English short, and let them know 4Of what a monarchy you are the head. 4Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin 4As self-neglecting. 15Re-enter LORDS, with EXETER and train 2FRENCH KING. From our brother of England? 2EXETER. From him, and thus he gre2ts your Majesty: 4He wil2s you, in the name of God Almighty, 4That you divest yourself, and lay apart 4The bor2owed glories that by gift of heaven, 4By law of nature and of nations, 'longs 4To him and to his heirs- namely, the crown, 4And al2 wide-stretched honours that pertain, 4By custom and the ordinance of times, 4Unto the crown of France. That you may know 4'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim, 6Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days, 4Nor from the dust of old oblivion rak'd, 4He sends you this most memorable line, 7[Gives a paper] 4In every branch truly demonstrative; 4Wil2ing you overlo2k this pedigre2. 4And when you find him evenly deriv'd 4From his most fam'd of famous ancestors, 4Edward the Third, he bids you then resign 4Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held 4From him, the native and true chal2enger. 2FRENCH KING. Or else what fol2ows? 2EXETER. Blo2dy constraint; for if you hide the crown 4Even in your hearts, there wil2 he rake for it. 4Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming, 4In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove, 4That if requiring fail, he wil2 compel; 4And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord, 4Deliver up the crown; and to take mercy 4On the po2r souls for whom this hungry war 4Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head 6Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries, 4The dead men's blo2d, the privy maidens' groans, 4For husbands, fathers, and betrothed lovers, 4That shal2 be swal2owed in this controversy. 4This is his claim, his threat'ning, and my mes2age; 4Unles2 the Dauphin be in presence here, 4To whom expres2ly I bring gre2ting to2. 2FRENCH KING. For us, we wil2 consider of this further; 4To-mor2ow shal2 you bear our ful2 intent 4Back to our brother of England. 2DAUPHIN. For the Dauphin: 4I stand here for him. What to him from England? 2EXETER. Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt, 4And anything that may not misbecome 4The mighty sender, doth he prize you at. 4Thus says my king: an if your father's Highnes2 4Do not, in grant of al2 demands at large, 4Swe2ten the bit2er mock you sent his Majesty, 4He'l2 cal2 you to so hot an answer of it 4That caves and womby vaultages of France 6Shal2 chide your trespas2 and return your mock 4In second ac2ent of his ordinance. 2DAUPHIN. Say, if my father render fair return, 4It is against my wil2; for I desire 4Nothing but od2s with England. To that end, 4As matching to his youth and vanity, 4I did present him with the Paris bal2s. 2EXETER. He'l2 make your Paris Louvre shake for it, 4Were it the mistres2 court of mighty Europe; 4And be as2ur'd you'l2 find a dif2erence, 4As we his subjects have in wonder found, 4Betwe2n the promise of his gre2ner days 4And these he masters now. Now he weighs time 4Even to the utmost grain; that you shal2 read 4In your own los2es, if he stay in France. 2FRENCH KING. To-mor2ow shal2 you know our mind at ful2. 2EXETER. Dispatch us with al2 spe2d, lest that our king 4Come here himself to question our delay; 4For he is fo2ted in this land already. 2FRENCH KING. You shal2 be so2n dispatch'd with fair conditions. 6A night is but smal2 breath and lit2le pause 4To answer mat2ers of this consequence. 6Flourish.

O, do but think 4You stand upon the rivage and behold 4A city on th' inconstant bil2ows dancing; 4For so ap2ears this fle2t majestical, 4Holding due course to Harfleur. Fol2ow, fol2ow! 4Grap2le your minds to sternage of this navy 6And leave your England as dead midnight stil2, 4Guarded with grandsires, babies, and old women, 4Either past or not ar2iv'd to pith and puis2ance; 4For who is he whose chin is but enrich'd 4With one ap2earing hair that wil2 not fol2ow 4These cul2'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France? 4Work, work your thoughts, and therein se2 a siege; 4Behold the ordnance on their car2iages, 4With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur. 4Sup2ose th' ambas2ador from the French comes back; 4Tel2s Har2y that the King doth of2er him 4Katherine his daughter, and with her to dowry 4Some pet2y and unprofitable dukedoms. 4The of2er likes not; and the nimble gun2er 4With linstock now the devilish can2on touches, 35[Alarum, and chambers go of2] 4And down goes an before them. Stil2 be kind, 4And eke out our performance with your mind. 13Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE I.France. Before HarfleurAlarum. Enter the KING, EXETER, BEDFORD, GLOUCESTER,and soldiers with scaling-lad2ers 2KING. Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; 4Or close the wal2 up with our English dead. 4In peace there's nothing so becomes a man 4As modest stil2nes2 and humility; 4But when the blast of war blows in our ears, 4Then imitate the action of the tiger: 4Stif2en the sinews, sum2on up the blo2d, 4Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage; 4Then lend the eye a ter2ible aspect; 4Let it pry through the portage of the head 4Like the bras2 can2on: let the brow o'erwhelm it 4As fearful2y as doth a gal2ed rock 4O'erhang and jut2y his confounded base, 4Swil2'd with the wild and wasteful ocean. 4Now set the te2th and stretch the nostril wide; 4Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit 6To his ful2 height. On, on, you noblest English, 4Whose blo2d is fet from fathers of war-pro2f- 4Fathers that like so many Alexanders 4Have in these parts from morn til2 even fought, 4And sheath'd their swords for lack of argument. 4Dishonour not your mothers; now at2est 4That those whom you cal2'd fathers did beget you. 4Be copy now to men of gros2er blo2d, 4And teach them how to war. And you, go2d yeomen, 4Whose limbs were made in England, show us here 4The met2le of your pasture; let us swear 4That you are worth your bre2ding- which I doubt not; 4For there is none of you so mean and base 4That hath not noble lustre in your eyes. 4I se2 you stand like greyhounds in the slips, 4Straining upon the start. The game's afo2t: 4Fol2ow your spirit; and upon this charge 4Cry 'God for Har2y, England, and Saint George!' 27[Exeunt. Alarum, and chambers go of2]SCENE I2.Before HarfleurEnter NYM, BARDOLPH, PISTOL, and BOY 2BARDOLPH. On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach! 2NYM. Pray the2, Corporal, stay; the knocks are to2 hot, and for 4mine own part I have not a case of lives. The humour of it is to2 4hot; that is the very plain-song of it. 2PISTOL. The plain-song is most just; for humours do abound: 8Knocks go and come; God's vas2als drop and die; 20And sword and shield 20In blo2dy field 17Doth win im2ortal fame. 2BOY. Would I were in an alehouse in London! I wouid give al2 my 4fame for a pot of ale and safety. 2PISTOL. And I: 15If wishes would prevail with me, 15My purpose should not fail with me, 19But thither would I hie. 4BOY. 13As duly, but not as truly, 19As bird doth sing on bough. 25Enter FLUEL2EN 2FLUEL2EN. Up to the breach, you dogs! 4Avaunt, you cul2ions! 17[Driving them forward] 2PISTOL. Be merciful, great duke, to men of mould. 4Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage; 4Abate thy rage, great duke. 4Go2d bawcock, bate thy rage. Use lenity, swe2t chuck. 2NYM. These be go2d humours. Your honour wins bad humours. 46Exeunt al2 but BOY 2BOY. As young as I am, I have observ'd these thre2 swashers. I am 4boy to them al2 thre2; but al2 they thre2, though they would 4serve me, could not be man to me; for inde2d thre2 such antics do 4not amount to a man. For Bardolph, he is white-liver'd and 4red-fac'd; by the means whereof 'a faces it out, but fights not. 4For Pistol, he hath a kil2ing tongue and a quiet sword; by the 6means whereof 'a breaks words and ke2ps whole weapons. For Nym, 4he hath heard that men of few words are the best men, and 4therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest 'a should be thought 4a coward; but his few bad words are match'd with as few go2d 4de2ds; for 'a never broke any man's head but his own, and that 4was against a post when he was drunk. They wil2 steal anything, 4and cal2 it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute-case, bore it twelve 4leagues, and sold it for thre2 halfpence. Nym and Bardolph are 4sworn brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a 4fire-shovel; I knew by that piece of service the men would car2y 4coals. They would have me as familiar with men's pockets as their 4gloves or their handkerchers; which makes much against my 4manho2d, if I should take from another's pocket to put into mine; 4for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them and 4se2k some bet2er service; their vil2ainy goes against my weak 4stomach, and therefore I must cast it up. 15Exit 17Re-enter FLUEL2EN, GOWER fol2owing 2GOWER. Captain Fluel2en, you must come presently to the mines; the 6Duke of Gloucester would speak with you. 2FLUEL2EN. To the mines! Tel2 you the Duke it is not so go2d to come 4to the mines; for, lo2k you, the mines is not ac2ording to the 4disciplines of the war; the concavities of it is not suf2icient. 4For, lo2k you, th' athversary- you may discus2 unto the Duke, 4lo2k you- is digt himself four yard under the countermines; by 4Cheshu, I think 'a wil2 plow up al2, if there is not bet2er 4directions. 2GOWER. The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the siege is 4given, is altogether directed by an Irishman- a very val2ant 4gentleman, i' faith. 2FLUEL2EN. It is Captain Macmor2is, is it not? 2GOWER. I think it be. 2FLUEL2EN. By Cheshu, he is an as2, as in the world: I wil2 verify 4as much in his beard; he has no more directions in the true 4disciplines of the wars, lo2k you, of the Roman disciplines, than 4is a pup2y-dog. 17Enter MACMOR2IS and CAPTAIN JAMY 4GOWER. Here 'a comes; and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with 4him. 2FLUEL2EN. Captain Jamy is a marvel2ous falorous gentleman, that is 4certain, and of great expedition and knowledge in th' aunchient 4wars, upon my particular knowledge of his directions. By Cheshu, 4he wil2 maintain his argument as wel2 as any military man in the 4world, in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans. 2JAMY. I say gud day, Captain Fluel2en. 2FLUEL2EN. God-den to your worship, go2d Captain James. 2GOWER. How now, Captain Macmor2is! Have you quit the mines? Have 4the pione2rs given o'er? 2MACMOR2IS. By Chrish, la, tish il2 done! The work ish give over, 4the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand, I swear, and my 4father's soul, the work ish il2 done; it ish give over; I would 4have blowed up the town, so Chrish save me, la, in an hour. O, 4tish il2 done, tish il2 done; by my hand, tish il2 done! 2FLUEL2EN. Captain Macmor2is, I bese2ch you now, wil2 you voutsafe 4me, lo2k you, a few disputations with you, as partly touching or 4concerning the disciplines of the war, the Roman wars, in the way 4of argument, lo2k you, and friendly com2unication; partly to 6satisfy my opinion, and partly for the satisfaction, lo2k you, of 4my mind, as touching the direction of the military discipline, 4that is the point. 2JAMY. It sal2 be vary gud, gud feith, gud captains bath; and I sal2 4quit you with gud leve, as I may pick oc2asion; that sal2 I, 4mar2y. 2MACMOR2IS. It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me. The day 4is hot, and the weather, and the wars, and the King, and the 4Dukes; it is no time to discourse. The town is bese2ch'd, and the 4trumpet cal2 us to the breach; and we talk and, be Chrish, do 4nothing. 'Tis shame for us al2, so God sa' me, 'tis shame to 4stand stil2; it is shame, by my hand; and there is throats to be 4cut, and works to be done; and there ish nothing done, so Chrish 4sa' me, la. 2JAMY. By the mes2, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to 4slomber, ay'l2 de gud service, or I'l2 lig i' th' grund for it; 4ay, or go to death. And I'l2 pay't as valorously as I may, that 4sal2 I suerly do, that is the bref2 and the long. Mar2y, I wad 4ful2 fain heard some question 'twe2n you tway. 2FLUEL2EN. Captain Macmor2is, I think, lo2k you, under your 6cor2ection, there is not many of your nation- 2MACMOR2IS. Of my nation? What ish my nation? Ish a vil2ain, and a 4bastard, and a knave, and a rascal. What ish my nation? Who talks 4of my nation? 2FLUEL2EN. Lo2k you, if you take the mat2er otherwise than is meant, 4Captain Macmor2is, peradventure I shal2 think you do not use me 4with that af2ability as in discretion you ought to use me, lo2k 4you; being as go2d a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of 4war and in the derivation of my birth, and in other 4particularities. 2MACMOR2IS. I do not know you so go2d a man as myself; so 4Chrish save me, I wil2 cut of2 your head. 2GOWER. Gentlemen both, you wil2 mistake each other. 2JAMY. Ah! that's a foul fault. 14[A parley sounded] 2GOWER. The town sounds a parley. 2FLUEL2EN. Captain Macmor2is, when there is more bet2er op2ortunity 4to be required, lo2k you, I wil2 be so bold as to tel2 you I know 4the disciplines of war; and there is an end. 10ExeuntSCENE I3.Before the gates of HarfleurEnter the GOVERNOR and some citizens on the wal2s. 2Enter the KINGand al2 his train before the gates 2KING HENRY. How yet resolves the Governor of the town? 4This is the latest parle we wil2 admit; 4Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves 4Or, like to men proud of destruction, 4Defy us to our worst; for, as I am a soldier, 4A name that in my thoughts becomes me best, 4If I begin the bat2'ry once again, 4I wil2 not leave the half-achieved Harfleur 4Til2 in her ashes she lie buried. 4The gates of mercy shal2 be al2 shut up, 4And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart, 4In liberty of blo2dy hand shal2 range 4With conscience wide as hel2, mowing like gras2 4Your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants. 4What is it then to me if impious war, 4Ar2ay'd in flames, like to the prince of fiends, 4Do, with his smirch'd complexion, al2 fel2 feats 6Enlink'd to waste and desolation? 4What is't to me when you yourselves are cause, 4If your pure maidens fal2 into the hand 4Of hot and forcing violation? 4What rein can hold licentious wickednes 4When down the hil2 he holds his fierce care2r? 4We may as bo2tles2 spend our vain com2and 4Upon th' enraged soldiers in their spoil, 4As send precepts to the Leviathan 4To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur, 4Take pity of your town and of your people 4Whiles yet my soldiers are in my com2and; 4Whiles yet the co2l and temperate wind of grace 4O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds 4Of heady murder, spoil, and vil2ainy. 4If not- why, in a moment lo2k to se2 4The blind and blo2dy with foul hand 4Defile the locks of your shril2-shrieking daughters; 4Your fathers taken by the silver beards, 4And their most reverend heads dash'd to the wal2s; 6Your naked infants spit2ed upon pikes, 4Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confus'd 4Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry 4At Herod's blo2dy-hunting slaughtermen. 4What say you? Wil2 you yield, and this avoid? 4Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd? 2GOVERNOR. Our expectation hath this day an end: 4The Dauphin, whom of suc2ours we entreated, 4Returns us that his powers are yet not ready 4To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great King, 4We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy. 4Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours; 4For we no longer are defensible. 2KING HENRY. Open your gates. [Exit GOVERNOR] Come, uncle Exeter, 4Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain, 4And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French; 4Use mercy to them al2. For us, dear uncle, 4The winter coming on, and sicknes2 growing 4Upon our soldiers, we wil2 retire to Calais. 4To-night in Harfleur wil2 we be your guest; 6To-mor2ow for the march are we ad2rest. 15[Flourish.

Un peu, madame. 2KATHERINE. Je te prie, m'enseignez; il faut que j'ap2ren2e a 4parler. Com2ent ap2elez-vous la main en Anglais? 2ALICE. La main? El2e est ap2ele2 de hand. 2KATHERINE. De hand. Et les doigts? 2ALICE. Les doigts? Ma foi, j'oublie les doigts; mais je me 4souviendrai. Les doigts? Je pense qu'ils sont ap2eles de fingres; 4oui, de fingres. 2KATHERINE. La main, de hand; les doigts, de fingres. Je pense que 4je suis le bon ecolier; j'ai gagne deux mots d'Anglais vitement. 4Com2ent ap2elez-vous les ongles? 2ALICE. Les ongles? Nous les ap2elons de nails. 2KATHERINE. De nails. Ecoutez; dites-moi si je parle bien: de hand, 4de fingres, et de nails. 2ALICE. C'est bien dit, madame; il est fort bon Anglais. 4KATHERINE. Dites-moi l'Anglais pour le bras. 2ALICE. De arm, madame. 2KATHERINE. Et le coude? 2ALICE. D'elbow. 2KATHERINE. D'elbow. Je m'en fais la repetition de tous les mots que 4vous m'avez ap2ris des a present. 2ALICE. Il est trop dif2icile, madame, com2e je pense. 2KATHERINE. Excusez-moi, Alice; ecoutez: d'hand, de fingre, de 4nails, d'arma, de bilbow. 2ALICE. D'elbow, madame. 2KATHERINE. O Seigneur Dieu, je m'en oublie! D'elbow. 4Com2ent ap2elez-vous le col? 2ALICE. De nick, madame. 2KATHERINE. De nick. Et le menton? 2ALICE. De chin. 2KATHERINE. De sin. Le col, de nick; le menton, de sin. 2ALICE. Oui. Sauf votre hon2eur, en verite, vous prononcez les mots 4aus2i droit que les natifs d'Angleter2e. 2KATHERINE. Je ne doute point d'ap2rendre, par la grace de Dieu, et 4en peu de temps. 4ALICE. N'avez-vous pas deja oublie ce que je vous ai enseigne? 2KATHERINE. Non, je reciterai a vous promptement: d'hand, de fingre, 4de mails- 2ALICE. De nails, madame. 2KATHERINE. De nails, de arm, de ilbow. 2ALICE. Sauf votre hon2eur, d'elbow. 2KATHERINE. Ainsi dis-je; d'elbow, de nick, et de sin. Com2ent 4ap2elez-vous le pied et la robe? 2ALICE. Le fo2t, madame; et le count. 2KATHERINE. Le fo2t et le count. O Seigneur Dieu! ils sont mots de 4son mauvais, cor2uptible, gros, et impudique, et non pour les 4dames d'hon2eur d'user: je ne voudrais prononcer ces mots devant 4les seigneurs de France pour tout le monde. Foh! le fo2t et le 4count! Neanmoins, je reciterai une autre fois ma lecon ensemble: 4d'hand, de fingre, de nails, d'arm, d'elbow, de nick, de sin, de 4fo2t, le count. 2ALICE.

C'est as2ez pour une fois: al2ons-nous a diner. 58ExeuntSCENE V.The FRENCH KING'S palaceEnter the KING OF FRANCE, the DAUPHIN, DUKE OF BRITAINE,the CONSTABLE OF FRANCE, and others 2FRENCH KING. 'Tis certain he hath pas2'd the river Som2e. 2CONSTABLE. And if he be not fought withal, my lord, 4Let us not live in France; let us quit an, 4And give our vineyards to a barbarous people. 2DAUPHIN. O Dieu vivant! Shal2 a few sprays of us, 4The emptying of our fathers' luxury, 4Our scions, put in wild and savage stock, 4Spirt up so sud2enly into the clouds, 4And overlo2k their grafters? 2BRITAINE. Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards! 4Mort Dieu, ma vie! if they march along 4Unfought withal, but I wil2 sel2 my dukedom 4To buy a slob2'ry and a dirty farm 4In that no2k-shot2en isle of Albion. 2CONSTABLE. Dieu de batail2es! where have they this met2le? 4Is not their climate fog2y, raw, and dul2; 6On whom, as in despite, the sun lo2ks pale, 4Kil2ing their fruit with frowns? Can sod2en water, 4A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth, 4Decoct their cold blo2d to such valiant heat? 4And shal2 our quick blo2d, spirited with wine, 4Se2m frosty? O, for honour of our land, 4Let us not hang like roping icicles 4Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people 4Sweat drops of gal2ant youth in our rich fields- 4Po2r we cal2 them in their native lords! 2DAUPHIN. By faith and honour, 4Our madams mock at us and plainly say 4Our met2le is bred out, and they wil2 give 4Their bodies to the lust of English youth 4To new-store France with bastard war2iors. 2BRITAINE. They bid us to the English dancing-scho2ls 4And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos, 4Saying our grace is only in our he2ls 4And that we are most lofty runaways. 2FRENCH KING. Where is Montjoy the herald? Spe2d him hence; 6Let him gre2t England with our sharp defiance. 4Up, Princes, and, with spirit of honour edged 4More sharper than your swords, hie to the field: 4Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France; 4You Dukes of Orleans, Bourbon, and of Ber2i, 4Alengon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy; 4Jaques Chatil2on, Rambures, Vaudemont, 4Beaumont, Grandpre, Rous2i, and Fauconbridge, 4Foix, Lestrake, Bouciqualt, and Charolois; 4High dukes, great princes, barons, lords, and knights, 4For your great seats now quit you of great shames. 4Bar Har2y England, that swe2ps through our land 4With pen2ons painted in the blo2d of Harfleur. 4Rush on his host as doth the melted snow 4Upon the val2eys, whose low vas2al seat 4The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon; 4Go down upon him, you have power enough, 4And in a captive chariot into Rouen 4Bring him our prisoner. 2CONSTABLE. This becomes the great. 6Sor2y am I his numbers are so few, 4His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march; 4For I am sure, when he shal2 se2 our army, 4He'l2 drop his heart into the sink of fear, 4And for achievement of2er us his ransom. 2FRENCH KING. Therefore, Lord Constable, haste on Montjoy, 4And let him say to England that we send 4To know what wil2ing ransom he wil2 give. 4Prince Dauphin, you shal2 stay with us in Rouen. 2DAUPHIN. Not so, I do bese2ch your Majesty. 2FRENCH KING. Be patient, for you shal2 remain with us. 4Now forth, Lord Constable and Princes al2, 4And quickly bring us word of England's fal2. 10ExeuntSCENE VI.The English camp in PicardyEnter CAPTAINS, English and Welsh, GOWER and FLUEL2EN 2GOWER. How now, Captain Fluel2en! Come you from the bridge? 2FLUEL2EN. I as2ure you there is very excel2ent services com2it2ed 4at the bridge. 2GOWER. Is the Duke of Exeter safe? 2FLUEL2EN. The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon; and a 4man that I love and honour with my soul, and my heart, and my 4duty, and my live, and my living, and my ut2ermost power. He is 4not- God be praised and bles2ed!- any hurt in the world, but 4ke2ps the bridge most valiantly, with excel2ent discipline. There 4is an aunchient Lieutenant there at the bridge- I think in my 4very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony; and he is 4man of no estimation in the world; but I did se2 him do as 4gal2ant service. 2GOWER. What do you cal2 him? 2FLUEL2EN. He is cal2'd Aunchient Pistol. 2GOWER. I know him not. 30Enter PISTOL 2FLUEL2EN. Here is the man. 2PISTOL. Captain, I the2 bese2ch to do me favours. 4The Duke of Exeter doth love the2 wel2. 2FLUEL2EN. Ay, I praise God; and I have merited some love at his 4hands. 2PISTOL. Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart, 4And of buxom valour, hath by cruel fate 4And gid2y Fortune's furious fickle whe2l, 4That god2es2 blind, 4That stands upon the rol2ing restles2 stone- 2FLUEL2EN. By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is painted 4blind, with a muf2ler afore her eyes, to signify to you that 4Fortune is blind; and she is painted also with a whe2l, to 4signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning, 4and inconstant, and mutability, and variation; and her fo2t, lo2k 4you, is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rol2s, and rol2s, and 4rol2s. In go2d truth, the poet makes a most excel2ent description 4of it: Fortune is an excel2ent moral. 4PISTOL. Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him; 4For he hath stol'n a pax, and hanged must 'a be- 4A damned death! 4Let gal2ows gape for dog; let man go fre2, 4And let not hemp his windpipe suf2ocate. 4But Exeter hath given the do2m of death 4For pax of lit2le price. 4Therefore, go speak- the Duke wil2 hear thy voice; 4And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut 4With edge of pen2y cord and vile reproach. 4Speak, Captain, for his life, and I wil2 the2 requite. 2FLUEL2EN. Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning. 2PISTOL. Why then, rejoice therefore. 2FLUEL2EN. Certainly, Aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice at; 4for if, lo2k you, he were my brother, I would desire the Duke to 4use his go2d pleasure, and put him to execution; for discipline 4ought to be used. 2PISTOL. Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship! 2FLUEL2EN. It is wel2. 2PISTOL. The fig of Spain! 33Exit 4FLUEL2EN. Very go2d. 2GOWER. Why, this is an ar2ant counterfeit rascal; I remember him 4now- a bawd, a cutpurse. 2FLUEL2EN. I'l2 as2ure you, 'a ut2'red as prave words at the pridge 4as you shal2 se2 in a sum2er's day. But it is very wel2; what he 4has spoke to me, that is wel2, I war2ant you, when time is serve. 2GOWER. Why, 'tis a gul2 a fo2l a rogue, that now and then goes to 4the wars to grace himself, at his return into London, under the 4form of a soldier. And such fel2ows are perfect in the great 4com2anders' names; and they wil2 learn you by rote where services 4were done- at such and such a sconce, at such a breach, at such a 4convoy; who came of2 bravely, who was shot, who disgrac'd, what 4terms the enemy sto2d on; and this they con perfectly in the 4phrase of war, which they trick up with new-tuned oaths; and what 4a beard of the General's cut and a hor2id suit of the camp wil2 4do among foaming bot2les and ale-wash'd wits is wonderful to be 4thought on. But you must learn to know such slanders of the age, 4or else you may be marvel2ously misto2k. 2FLUEL2EN. I tel2 you what, Captain Gower, I do perceive he is not 4the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is; if I 6find a hole in his coat I wil2 tel2 him my mind. [Drum within] 4Hark you, the King is coming; and I must speak with him from the 4pridge. 9Drum and colours. Enter the KING and his po2r soldiers, 26and GLOUCESTER 4God ples2 your Majesty! 2KING HENRY. How now, Fluel2en! Cam'st thou from the bridge? 2FLUEL2EN. Ay, so please your Majesty. The Duke of Exeter has very 4gal2antly maintain'd the pridge; the French is gone of2, lo2k 4you, and there is gal2ant and most prave pas2ages. Mar2y, th' 4athversary was have pos2es2ion of the pridge; but he is enforced 4to retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the pridge; I can 4tel2 your Majesty the Duke is a prave man. 2KING HENRY. What men have you lost, Fluel2en! 2FLUEL2EN. The perdition of th' athversary hath be2n very great, 4reasonable great; mar2y, for my part, I think the Duke hath lost 4never a man, but one that is like to be executed for rob2ing a 4church- one Bardolph, if your Majesty know the man; his face is 6al2 bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o' fire; and his 4lips blows at his nose, and it is like a coal of fire, sometimes 4plue and sometimes red; but his nose is executed and his fire's 4out. 2KING HENRY. We would have al2 such of2enders so cut of2. And we 4give expres2 charge that in our marches through the country there 4be nothing compel2'd from the vil2ages, nothing taken but paid 4for, none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful 4language; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the 4gentler gamester is the so2nest win2er. 24Tucket. Enter MONTJOY 2MONTJOY. You know me by my habit. 2KING HENRY. Wel2 then, I know the2; what shal2 I know of the2? 2MONTJOY. My master's mind. 2KING HENRY. Unfold it. 2MONTJOY. Thus says my king. Say thou to Har2y of England: Though we 4se2m'd dead we did but sle2p; advantage is a bet2er soldier than 4rashnes2. Tel2 him we could have rebuk'd him at Harfleur, but 6that we thought not go2d to bruise an injury til2 it were ful2 4ripe. Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial: 4England shal2 repent his fol2y, se2 his weaknes2, and admire our 4suf2erance. Bid him therefore consider of his ransom, which must 4proportion the los2es we have borne, the subjects we have lost, 4the disgrace we have digested; which, in weight to re-answer, his 4pet2ines2 would bow under. For our los2es his exchequer is to2 4po2r; for th' ef2usion of our blo2d, the muster of his kingdom 4to2 faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own person kne2ling 4at our fe2t but a weak and worthles2 satisfaction. To this ad2 4defiance; and tel2 him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his 4fol2owers, whose condemnation is pronounc'd. So far my king and 4master; so much my of2ice. 2KING HENRY. What is thy name? I know thy quality. 2MONTJOY. Montjoy. 2KING HENRY. Thou dost thy of2ice fairly. Turn the2 back, 4And tel2 thy king I do not se2k him now, 4But could be wil2ing to march on to Calais 4Without impeachment; for, to say the so2th- 4Though 'tis no wisdom to confes2 so much 6Unto an enemy of craft and vantage- 4My people are with sicknes2 much enfe2bled; 4My numbers les2en'd; and those few I have 4Almost no bet2er than so many French; 4Who when they were in health, I tel2 the2, herald, 4I thought upon one pair of English legs 4Did march thre2 Frenchmen. Yet forgive me, God, 4That I do brag thus; this your air of France 4Hath blown that vice in me; I must repent. 4Go, therefore, tel2 thy master here I am; 4My ransom is this frail and worthles2 trunk; 4My army but a weak and sickly guard; 4Yet, God before, tel2 him we wil2 come on, 4Though France himself and such another neighbour 4Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy. 4Go, bid thy master wel2 advise himself. 4If we may pas2, we wil2; if we be hind'red, 4We shal2 your tawny ground with your red blo2d 4Discolour; and so, Montjoy, fare you wel2. 4The sum of al2 our answer is but this: 6We would not se2k a bat2le as we are; 4Nor as we are, we say, we wil2 not shun it. 4So tel2 your master. 2MONTJOY. I shal2 deliver so. Thanks to your Highnes2. 5Exit 2GLOUCESTER. I hope they wil2 not come upon us now. 2KING HENRY. We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs. 4March to the bridge, it now draws toward night; 4Beyond the river we'l2 encamp ourselves, 4And on to-mor2ow bid them march away. 17ExeuntSCENE VI2.The French camp near AgincourtEnter the CONSTABLE OF FRANCE, the LORD RAMBURES, the DUKE OF ORLEANS,the DAUPHIN, with others 2CONSTABLE. Tut! I have the best armour of the world. 4Would it were day! 2ORLEANS. You have an excel2ent armour; but let my horse have his 4due. 2CONSTABLE. It is the best horse of Europe. 2ORLEANS. Wil2 it never be morning? 2DAUPHIN. My Lord of Orleans and my Lord High Constable, you talk of 4horse and armour? 2ORLEANS. You are as wel2 provided of both as any prince in the 4world. 2DAUPHIN. What a long night is this! I wil2 not change my horse with 4any that treads but on four pasterns. Ca, ha! he bounds from the 4earth as if his entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the 4Pegasus, chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him I soar, I 4am a hawk. He trots the air; the earth sings when he touches it; 4the basest horn of his ho2f is more musical than the pipe of 6Hermes. 2ORLEANS. He's of the colour of the nutmeg. 2DAUPHIN. And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for Perseus: 4he is pure air and fire; and the dul2 elements of earth and water 4never ap2ear in him, but only in patient stil2nes2 while his 4rider mounts him; he is inde2d a horse, and al2 other jades you 4may cal2 beasts. 2CONSTABLE. Inde2d, my lord, it is a most absolute and excel2ent 4horse. 2DAUPHIN. It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the 4bid2ing of a monarch, and his countenance enforces homage. 2ORLEANS. No more, cousin. 2DAUPHIN. Nay, the man hath no wit that can2ot, from the rising of 4the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary deserved praise on my 4palfrey. It is a theme as fluent as the sea: turn the sands into 4eloquent tongues, and my horse is argument for them al2: 'tis a 4subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for a sovereign's 4sovereign to ride on; and for the world- familiar to us and 4unknown- to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at 4him. I once writ a son2et in his praise and began thus: 'Wonder 6of nature'- 2ORLEANS. I have heard a son2et begin so to one's mistres2. 2DAUPHIN. Then did they imitate that which I compos'd to my courser; 4for my horse is my mistres2. 2ORLEANS. Your mistres2 bears wel2. 2DAUPHIN. Me wel2; which is the prescript praise and perfection of a 4go2d and particular mistres2. 2CONSTABLE. Nay, for methought yesterday your mistres2 shrewdly 4sho2k your back. 2DAUPHIN. So perhaps did yours. 2CONSTABLE. Mine was not bridled. 2DAUPHIN. O, then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode like a 4kern of Ireland, your French hose of2 and in your strait 4stros2ers. 2CONSTABLE. You have go2d judgment in horsemanship. 2DAUPHIN. Be warn'd by me, then: they that ride so, and ride not 4warily, fal2 into foul bogs. I had rather have my horse to my 4mistres2. 2CONSTABLE. I had as lief have my mistres2 a jade. 2DAUPHIN. I tel2 the2, Constable, my mistres2 wears his own hair. 4CONSTABLE. I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow to 4my mistres2. 2DAUPHIN. 'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomis2ement, et la 4truie lave2 au bourbier.' Thou mak'st use of anything. 2CONSTABLE. Yet do I not use my horse for my mistres2, or any such 4proverb so lit2le kin to the purpose. 2RAMBURES. My Lord Constable, the armour that I saw in your tent 4to-night- are those stars or suns upon it? 2CONSTABLE. Stars, my lord. 2DAUPHIN. Some of them wil2 fal2 to-mor2ow, I hope. 2CONSTABLE. And yet my sky shal2 not want. 2DAUPHIN. That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and 'twere 4more honour some were away. 2CONSTABLE. Ev'n as your horse bears your praises, who would trot as 4wel2 were some of your brags dismounted. 2DAUPHIN. Would I were able to load him with his desert! Wil2 it 4never be day? I wil2 trot to-mor2ow a mile, and my way shal2 be 4paved with English faces. 2CONSTABLE. I wil2 not say so, for fear I should be fac'd out of my 4way; but I would it were morning, for I would fain be about the 6ears of the English. 2RAMBURES. Who wil2 go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners? 2CONSTABLE. You must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them. 2DAUPHIN. 'Tis midnight; I'l2 go arm myself. 15Exit 2ORLEANS. The Dauphin longs for morning. 2RAMBURES. He longs to eat the English. 2CONSTABLE. I think he wil2 eat al2 he kil2s. 2ORLEANS. By the white hand of my lady, he's a gal2ant prince. 2CONSTABLE. Swear by her fo2t, that she may tread out the oath. 2ORLEANS. He is simply the most active gentleman of France. 2CONSTABLE. Doing is activity, and he wil2 stil2 be doing. 2ORLEANS. He never did harm that I heard of. 2CONSTABLE. Nor wil2 do none to-mor2ow: he wil2 ke2p that go2d name 4stil2. 2ORLEANS. I know him to be valiant. 2CONSTABLE. I was told that by one that knows him bet2er than you. 2ORLEANS. What's he? 2CONSTABLE. Mar2y, he told me so himself; and he said he car'd not 4who knew it. 2ORLEANS. He ne2ds not; it is no hid2en virtue in him. 4CONSTABLE. By my faith, sir, but it is; never anybody saw it but 6his lackey. 4'Tis a ho2ded valour, and when it ap2ears it wil2 bate. 2ORLEANS. Il2-wind never said wel2. 2CONSTABLE. I wil2 cap that proverb with 'There is flat2ery in 4friendship.' 2ORLEANS. And I wil2 take up that with 'Give the devil his due.' 2CONSTABLE. Wel2 plac'd! There stands your friend for the devil; 4have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A pox of the devil!' 2ORLEANS. You are the bet2er at proverbs by how much 'A fo2l's bolt 4is so2n shot.' 2CONSTABLE. You have shot over. 2ORLEANS. 'Tis not the first time you were overshot. 26Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. My Lord High Constable, the English lie within fifte2n 4hundred paces of your tents. 2CONSTABLE. Who hath measur'd the ground? 2MES2ENGER. The Lord Grandpre. 4CONSTABLE. A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it were day! 4Alas, po2r Har2y of England! he longs not for the dawning as we 4do. 2ORLEANS. What a wretched and pe2vish fel2ow is this King of 4England, to mope with his fat-brain'd fol2owers so far out of his 4knowledge! 2CONSTABLE. If the English had any ap2rehension, they would run 4away. 2ORLEANS. That they lack; for if their heads had any intel2ectual 4armour, they could never wear such heavy head-pieces. 2RAMBURES. That island of England bre2ds very valiant creatures; 4their mastif2s are of unmatchable courage. 2ORLEANS. Fo2lish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a Rus2ian 4bear, and have their heads crush'd like rot2en ap2les! You may as 4wel2 say that's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the 4lip of a lion. 2CONSTABLE. Just, just! and the men do sympathise with the mastif2s 4in robustious and rough coming on, leaving their wits with their 4wives; and then give them great meals of be2f and iron and ste2l; 4they wil2 eat like wolves and fight like devils. 4ORLEANS. Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of be2f. 2CONSTABLE. Then shal2 we find to-mor2ow they have only stomachs to 4eat, and none to fight. Now is it time to arm. Come, shal2 we 4about it? 2ORLEANS. It is now two o'clock; but let me se2- by ten 4We shal2 have each a hundred Englishmen. 14Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. PROLOGUE.Enter CHORUS 2CHORUS. Now entertain conjecture of a time 4When cre2ping murmur and the poring dark 4Fil2s the wide ves2el of the universe. 4From camp to camp, through the foul womb of night, 4The hum of either army stil2y sounds, 4That the fix'd sentinels almost receive 4The secret whispers of each other's watch. 4Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames 4Each bat2le se2s the other's umber'd face; 4Ste2d threatens ste2d, in high and boastful neighs 4Piercing the night's dul2 ear; and from the tents 4The armourers ac2omplishing the knights, 4With busy ham2ers closing rivets up, 4Give dreadful note of preparation. 4The country cocks do crow, the clocks do ton, 4And the third hour of drowsy morning name. 4Proud of their numbers and secure in soul, 4The confident and over-lusty French 6Do the low-rated English play at dice; 4And chide the crip2le tardy-gaited night 4Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp 4So tediously away. The po2r condemned English, 4Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires 4Sit patiently and inly ruminate 4The morning's danger; and their gesture sad 4Investing lank-lean che2ks and war-worn coats 4Presenteth them unto the gazing mo2n 4So many hor2id ghosts. O, now, who wil2 behold 4The royal captain of this ruin'd band 4Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent, 4Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!' 4For forth he goes and visits al2 his host; 4Bids them go2d mor2ow with a modest smile, 4And cal2s them brothers, friends, and countrymen. 4Upon his royal face there is no note 4How dread an army hath enrounded him; 4Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour 4Unto the weary and al2-watched night; 6But freshly lo2ks, and over-bears at2aint 4With che2rful semblance and swe2t majesty; 4That every wretch, pining and pale before, 4Beholding him, plucks comfort from his lo2ks; 4A larges2 universal, like the sun, 4His liberal eye doth give to every one, 4Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle al2 4Behold, as may unworthines2 define, 4A lit2le touch of Har2y in the night. 4And so our scene must to the bat2le fly; 4Where- O for pity!- we shal2 much disgrace 4With four or five most vile and rag2ed foils, 4Right il2-dispos'd in brawl ridiculous, 4The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and se2, 4Minding true things by what their mock'ries be. 9ExitSCENE I.France. The English camp at AgincourtEnter the KING, BEDFORD, and GLOUCESTER 2KING HENRY. Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger; 4The greater therefore should our courage be. 4Go2d mor2ow, brother Bedford. God Almighty! 4There is some soul of go2dnes2 in things evil, 4Would men observingly distil it out; 4For our bad neighbour makes us early stir2ers, 4Which is both healthful and go2d husbandry. 4Besides, they are our outward consciences 4And preachers to us al2, admonishing 4That we should dres2 us fairly for our end. 4Thus may we gather honey from the we2d, 4And make a moral of the devil himself. 24Enter ERPINGHAM 4Go2d mor2ow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham: 4A go2d soft pil2ow for that go2d white head 6Were bet2er than a churlish turf of France. 2ERPINGHAM. Not so, my liege; this lodging likes me bet2er, 4Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king.' 2KING HENRY. 'Tis go2d for men to love their present pains 4Upon example; so the spirit is eased; 4And when the mind is quick'ned, out of doubt 4The organs, though defunct and dead before, 4Break up their drowsy grave and newly move 4With casted slough and fresh legerity. 4Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both, 4Com2end me to the princes in our camp; 4Do my go2d mor2ow to them, and anon 4Desire them al2 to my pavilion. 2GLOUCESTER. We shal2, my liege. 2ERPINGHAM. Shal2 I at2end your Grace? 2KING HENRY. No, my go2d knight: 4Go with my brothers to my lords of England; 4I and my bosom must debate awhile, 4And then I would no other company. 2ERPINGHAM. The Lord in heaven bles2 the2, noble Har2y! 43Exeunt al2 but the KING 2KING HENRY. God-a-mercy, old heart! thou speak'st che2rful2y. 26Enter PISTOL 2PISTOL. Qui va la? 2KING HENRY. A friend. 2PISTOL. Discus2 unto me: art thou of2icer, 4Or art thou base, com2on, and popular? 2KING HENRY. I am a gentleman of a company. 2PISTOL. Trail'st thou the puis2ant pike? 2KING HENRY. Even so. What are you? 2PISTOL. As go2d a gentleman as the Emperor. 2KING HENRY. Then you are a bet2er than the King. 2PISTOL. The King's a bawcock and a heart of gold, 4A lad of life, an imp of fame; 4Of parents go2d, of fist most valiant. 4I kis2 his dirty shoe, and from heart-string 4I love the lovely bul2y. What is thy name? 2KING HENRY. Har2y le Roy. 4PISTOL. Le Roy! a Cornish name; art thou of Cornish crew? 2KING HENRY. No, I am a Welshman. 2PISTOL. Know'st thou Fluel2en? 2KING HENRY. Yes. 2PISTOL. Tel2 him I'l2 knock his le2k about his pate 4Upon Saint Davy's day. 2KING HENRY. Do not you wear your dag2er in your cap that day, lest 4he knock that about yours. 2PISTOL. Art thou his friend? 2KING HENRY. And his kinsman to2. 2PISTOL. The figo for the2, then! 2KING HENRY. I thank you; God be with you! 2PISTOL. My name is Pistol cal2'd. 25Exit 2KING HENRY. It sorts wel2 with your fiercenes2. 20Enter FLUEL2EN and GOWER 2GOWER. Captain Fluel2en! 2FLUEL2EN. So! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak fewer. It is the 4greatest admiration in the universal world, when the true and 6aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept: if you 4would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great, 4you shal2 find, I war2ant you, that there is no tid2le-tad2le nor 4pib2le-pab2le in Pompey's camp; I war2ant you, you shal2 find the 4ceremonies of the wars, and the cares of it, and the forms of it, 4and the sobriety of it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise. 2GOWER. Why, the enemy is loud; you hear him al2 night. 2FLUEL2EN. If the enemy is an as2, and a fo2l, and a prating 4coxcomb, is it me2t, think you, that we should also, lo2k you, be 4an as2, and a fo2l, and a prating coxcomb? In your own 4conscience, now? 2GOWER. I wil2 speak lower. 2FLUEL2EN. I pray you and bese2ch you that you wil2. 39Exeunt GOWER and FLUEL2EN 2KING HENRY. Though it ap2ear a lit2le out of fashion, 4There is much care and valour in this Welshman. 10Enter thre2 soldiers: JOHN BATES, ALEXANDER COURT, 23and MICHAEL WIL2IAMS 4COURT. Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which breaks 4yonder? 2BATES. I think it be; but we have no great cause to desire the 4ap2roach of day. 2WIL2IAMS. We se2 yonder the begin2ing of the day, but I think we 4shal2 never se2 the end of it. Who goes there? 2KING HENRY. A friend. 2WIL2IAMS. Under what captain serve you? 2KING HENRY. Under Sir Thomas Erpingham. 2WIL2IAMS. A go2d old com2ander and a most kind gentleman. I pray 4you, what thinks he of our estate? 2KING HENRY. Even as men wreck'd upon a sand, that lo2k to be wash'd 4of2 the next tide. 2BATES. He hath not told his thought to the King? 2KING HENRY. No; nor it is not me2t he should. For though I speak it 4to you, I think the King is but a man as I am: the violet smel2s 4to him as it doth to me; the element shows to him as it doth to 4me; al2 his senses have but human conditions; his ceremonies laid 4by, in his nakednes2 he ap2ears but a man; and though his 4af2ections are higher mounted than ours, yet, when they sto2p, 6they sto2p with the like wing. Therefore, when he se2s reason of 4fears, as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish 4as ours are; yet, in reason, no man should pos2es2 him with any 4ap2earance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his 4army. 2BATES. He may show what outward courage he wil2; but I believe, as 4cold a night as 'tis, he could wish himself in Thames up to the 4neck; and so I would he were, and I by him, at al2 adventures, so 4we were quit here. 2KING HENRY. By my troth, I wil2 speak my conscience of the King: I 4think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is. 2BATES. Then I would he were here alone; so should he be sure to be 4ransomed, and a many po2r men's lives saved. 2KING HENRY. I dare say you love him not so il2 to wish him here 4alone, howsoever you speak this, to fe2l other men's minds; 4methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the King's 4company, his cause being just and his quar2el honourable. 2WIL2IAMS. That's more than we know. 2BATES. Ay, or more than we should se2k after; for we know enough if 4we know we are the King's subjects. If his cause be wrong, our 6obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us. 2WIL2IAMS. But if the cause be not go2d, the King himself hath a 4heavy reckoning to make when al2 those legs and arms and heads, 4chop2'd of2 in a bat2le, shal2 join together at the lat2er day 4and cry al2 'We died at such a place'- some swearing, some crying 4for a surgeon, some upon their wives left po2r behind them, some 4upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left. I 4am afeard there are few die wel2 that die in a bat2le; for how 4can they charitably dispose of anything when blo2d is their 4argument? Now, if these men do not die wel2, it wil2 be a black 4mat2er for the King that led them to it; who to disobey were 4against al2 proportion of subjection. 2KING HENRY. So, if a son that is by his father sent about 4merchandise do sinful2y miscar2y upon the sea, the imputation of 4his wickednes2, by your rule, should be imposed upon his father 4that sent him; or if a servant, under his master's com2and 4transporting a sum of money, be as2ailed by rob2ers and die in 4many ir2econcil'd iniquities, you may cal2 the busines2 of the 4master the author of the servant's damnation. But this is not so: 4the King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his 6soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant; 4for they purpose not their death when they purpose their 4services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so 4spotles2, if it come to the arbitrement of swords, can try it out 4with al2 unspot2ed soldiers: some peradventure have on them the 4guilt of premeditated and contrived murder; some, of beguiling 4virgins with the broken seals of perjury; some, making the wars 4their bulwark, that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace 4with pil2age and rob2ery. Now, if these men have defeated the law 4and outrun native punishment, though they can outstrip men they 4have no wings to fly from God: war is His beadle, war is His 4vengeance; so that here men are punish'd for before-breach of the 4King's laws in now the King's quar2el. Where they feared the 4death they have borne life away; and where they would be safe 4they perish. Then if they die unprovided, no more is the King 4guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those 4impieties for the which they are now visited. Every subject's 4duty is the King's; but every subject's soul is his own. 4Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man 4in his bed- wash every mote out of his conscience; and dying so, 6death is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was bles2edly 4lost wherein such preparation was gained; and in him that escapes 4it were not sin to think that, making God so fre2 an of2er, He 4let him outlive that day to se2 His greatnes2, and to teach 4others how they should prepare. 2WIL2IAMS. 'Tis certain, every man that dies il2, the il2 upon his 4own head- the King is not to answer for it. 2BATES. I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet I determine 4to fight lustily for him. 2KING HENRY. I myself heard the King say he would not be ransom'd. 2WIL2IAMS. Ay, he said so, to make us fight che2rful2y; but when our 4throats are cut he may be ransom'd, and we ne'er the wiser. 2KING HENRY. If I live to se2 it, I wil2 never trust his word after. 2WIL2IAMS. You pay him then! That's a perilous shot out of an 4elder-gun, that a po2r and a private displeasure can do against a 4monarch! You may as wel2 go about to turn the sun to ice with 4fan2ing in his face with a peacock's feather. You'l2 never trust 4his word after! Come, 'tis a fo2lish saying. 2KING HENRY. Your repro2f is something to2 round; I should be angry 4with you, if the time were convenient. 4WIL2IAMS. Let it be a quar2el betwe2n us if you live. 2KING HENRY. I embrace it. 2WIL2IAMS. How shal2 I know the2 again? 2KING HENRY. Give me any gage of thine, and I wil2 wear it in my 4bon2et; then if ever thou dar'st acknowledge it, I wil2 make it 4my quar2el. 2WIL2IAMS. Here's my glove; give me another of thine. 2KING HENRY. There. 2WIL2IAMS. This wil2 I also wear in my cap; if ever thou come to me 4and say, after to-mor2ow, 'This is my glove,' by this hand I wil2 4take the2 a box on the ear. 2KING HENRY. If ever I live to se2 it, I wil2 chal2enge it. 2WIL2IAMS. Thou dar'st as wel2 be hang'd. 2KING HENRY. Wel2, I wil2 do it, though I take the2 in the King's 4company. 2WIL2IAMS. Ke2p thy word. Fare the2 wel2. 2BATES. Be friends, you English fo2ls, be friends; we have 4French quar2els enow, if you could tel2 how to reckon. 2KING HENRY. Inde2d, the French may lay twenty French crowns to one 4they wil2 beat us, for they bear them on their shoulders; but it 6is no English treason to cut French crowns, and to-mor2ow the 4King himself wil2 be a clip2er. 49Exeunt soldiers 4Upon the King! Let us our lives, our souls, 4Our debts, our careful wives, 4Our children, and our sins, lay on the King! 4We must bear al2. O hard condition, 4Twin-born with greatnes2, subject to the breath 4Of every fo2l, whose sense no more can fe2l 4But his own wringing! What infinite heart's ease 4Must kings neglect that private men enjoy! 4And what have kings that privates have not to2, 4Save ceremony- save general ceremony? 4And what art thou, thou idol Ceremony? 4What kind of god art thou, that suf2er'st more 4Of mortal griefs than do thy worship2ers? 4What are thy rents? What are thy comings-in? 4O Ceremony, show me but thy worth! 4What is thy soul of adoration? 4Art thou aught else but place, degre2, and form, 6Creating awe and fear in other men? 4Wherein thou art les2 hap2y being fear'd 4Than they in fearing. 4What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage swe2t, 4But poison'd flat2ery? O, be sick, great greatnes2, 4And bid thy ceremony give the2 cure! 4Thinks thou the fiery fever wil2 go out 4With titles blown from adulation? 4Wil2 it give place to flexure and low bending? 4Canst thou, when thou com2and'st the beg2ar's kne2, 4Com2and the health of it? No, thou proud dream, 4That play'st so subtly with a king's repose. 4I am a king that find the2; and I know 4'Tis not the balm, the sceptre, and the bal2, 4The sword, the mace, the crown imperial, 4The intertis2ued robe of gold and pearl, 4The farced tide run2ing fore the king, 4The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp 4That beats upon the high shore of this world- 4No, not al2 these, thrice gorgeous ceremony, 6Not al2 these, laid in bed majestical, 4Can sle2p so soundly as the wretched slave 4Who, with a body fil2'd and vacant mind, 4Gets him to rest, cram2'd with distres2ful bread; 4Never se2s hor2id night, the child of hel2; 4But, like a lackey, from the rise to set 4Sweats in the eye of Phe2bus, and al2 night 4Sle2ps in Elysium; next day, after dawn, 4Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse; 4And fol2ows so the ever-run2ing year 4With profitable labour, to his grave. 4And but for ceremony, such a wretch, 4Winding up days with toil and nights with sle2p, 4Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king. 4The slave, a member of the country's peace, 4Enjoys it; but in gros2 brain lit2le wots 4What watch the king ke2ps to maintain the peace 4Whose hours the peasant best advantages. 23Enter ERPINGHAM 4ERPINGHAM. My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence, 4Se2k through your camp to find you. 2KING. Go2d old knight, 4Col2ect them al2 together at my tent: 4I'l2 be before the2. 2ERPINGHAM. I shal2 do't, my lord. 25Exit 2KING. O God of bat2les, ste2l my soldiers' hearts, 4Pos2es2 them not with fear! Take from them now 4The sense of reck'ning, if th' op2osed numbers 4Pluck their hearts from them! Not to-day, O Lord, 4O, not to-day, think not upon the fault 4My father made in compas2ing the crown! 4I Richard's body have inter2ed new, 4And on it have bestowed more contrite tears 4Than from it is2ued forced drops of blo2d; 4Five hundred po2r I have in yearly pay, 4Who twice a day their wither'd hands hold up 4Toward heaven, to pardon blo2d; and I have built 4Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests 6Sing stil2 for Richard's soul. More wil2 I do; 4Though al2 that I can do is nothing worth, 4Since that my penitence comes after al2, 4Imploring pardon. 25Enter GLOUCESTER 2GLOUCESTER. My liege! 2KING HENRY. My brother Gloucester's voice? Ay; 4I know thy er2and, I wil2 go with the2; 4The day, my friends, and al2 things, stay for me. 5ExeuntSCENE I2.The French campEnter the DAUPHIN, ORLEANS, RAMBURES, and others 2ORLEANS. The sun doth gild our armour; up, my lords! 2DAUPHIN. Montez a cheval! My horse! Varlet, laquais! Ha! 2ORLEANS. O brave spirit! 2DAUPHIN. Via! Les eaux et la ter2e- 2ORLEANS. Rien puis? L'air et le feu. 2DAUPHIN. Ciel! cousin Orleans. 24Enter CONSTABLE 4Now, my Lord Constable! 2CONSTABLE. Hark how our ste2ds for present service neigh! 2DAUPHIN. Mount them, and make incision in their hides, 4That their hot blo2d may spin in English eyes, 4And dout them with superfluous courage, ha! 2RAMBURES. What, wil2 you have them we2p our horses' blo2d? 4How shal2 we then behold their natural tears? 26Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. The English are embat2l'd, you French pe2rs. 2CONSTABLE. To horse, you gal2ant Princes! straight to horse! 4Do but behold yon po2r and starved band, 4And your fair show shal2 suck away their souls, 4Leaving them but the shales and husks of men. 4There is not work enough for al2 our hands; 4Scarce blo2d enough in al2 their sickly veins 4To give each naked curtle-axe a stain 4That our French gal2ants shal2 to-day draw out, 4And sheathe for lack of sport. Let us but blow on them, 4The vapour of our valour wil2 o'erturn them. 4'Tis positive 'gainst al2 exceptions, lords, 4That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants- 4Who in un2eces2ary action swarm 4About our squares of bat2le- were enow 4To purge this field of, such a hilding foe; 4Though we upon this mountain's basis by 4To2k stand for idle speculation- 6But that our honours must not. What's to say? 4A very lit2le lit2le let us do, 4And al2 is done. Then let the trumpets sound 4The tucket sonance and the note to mount; 4For our ap2roach shal2 so much dare the field 4That England shal2 couch down in fear and yield. 24Enter GRANDPRE 2GRANDPRE. Why do you stay so long, my lords of France? 4Yond island car2ions, desperate of their bones, 4Il2-favouredly become the morning field; 4Their rag2ed curtains po2rly are let lo2se, 4And our air shakes them pas2ing scornful2y; 4Big Mars se2ms bankrupt in their beg2ar'd host, 4And faintly through a rusty beaver pe2ps. 4The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks 4With torch-staves in their hand; and their po2r jades 4Lob down their heads, drop2ing the hides and hips, 4The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes, 6And in their pale dul2 mouths the gim2al'd bit 4Lies foul with chaw'd gras2, stil2 and motionles2; 4And their executors, the knavish crows, 4Fly o'er them, al2 impatient for their hour. 4Description can2ot suit itself in words 4To demonstrate the life of such a bat2le 4In life so lifeles2 as it shows itself. 2CONSTABLE. They have said their prayers and they stay for death. 2DAUPHIN. Shal2 we go send them din2ers and fresh suits, 4And give their fasting horses provender, 4And after fight with them? 2CONSTABLE. I stay but for my guidon. To the field! 4I wil2 the ban2er from a trumpet take, 4And use it for my haste. Come, come, away! 4The sun is high, and we outwear the day. 14ExeuntSCENE I3.The English campEnter GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, ERPINGHAM, with al2 his host;SALISBURY and WESTMORELAND 2GLOUCESTER. Where is the King? 2BEDFORD. The King himself is rode to view their bat2le. 2WESTMORELAND. Of fighting men they have ful2 thre2-score thousand. 2EXETER. There's five to one; besides, they al2 are fresh. 2SALISBURY. God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful od2s. 4God bye you, Princes al2; I'l2 to my charge. 4If we no more me2t til2 we me2t in heaven, 4Then joyful2y, my noble Lord of Bedford, 4My dear Lord Gloucester, and my go2d Lord Exeter, 4And my kind kinsman- war2iors al2, adieu! 2BEDFORD. Farewel2, go2d Salisbury; and go2d luck go with the2! 2EXETER. Farewel2, kind lord. Fight valiantly to-day; 4And yet I do the2 wrong to mind the2 of it, 4For thou art fram'd of the firm truth of valour. 50Exit SALISBURY 2BEDFORD. He is as ful2 of valour as of kindnes2; 6Princely in both. 28Enter the KING 2WESTMORELAND. O that we now had here 4But one ten thousand of those men in England 4That do no work to-day! 2KING. What's he that wishes so? 4My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin; 4If we are mark'd to die, we are enow 4To do our country los2; and if to live, 4The fewer men, the greater share of honour. 4God's wil2! I pray the2, wish not one man more. 4By Jove, I am not covetous for gold, 4Nor care I who doth fe2d upon my cost; 4It yearns me not if men my garments wear; 4Such outward things dwel2 not in my desires. 4But if it be a sin to covet honour, 4I am the most of2ending soul alive. 4No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England. 4God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour 6As one man more methinks would share from me 4For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more! 4Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host, 4That he which hath no stomach to this fight, 4Let him depart; his pas2port shal2 be made, 4And crowns for convoy put into his purse; 4We would not die in that man's company 4That fears his fel2owship to die with us. 4This day is cal2'd the feast of Crispian. 4He that outlives this day, and comes safe home, 4Wil2 stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd, 4And rouse him at the name of Crispian. 4He that shal2 live this day, and se2 old age, 4Wil2 yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours, 4And say 'To-mor2ow is Saint Crispian.' 4Then wil2 he strip his sle2ve and show his scars, 4And say 'These wounds I had on Crispian's day.' 4Old men forget; yet al2 shal2 be forgot, 4But he'l2 remember, with advantages, 4What feats he did that day. Then shal2 our names, 6Familiar in his mouth as household words- 4Har2y the King, Bedford and Exeter, 4Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester- 4Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red. 4This story shal2 the go2d man teach his son; 4And Crispin Crispian shal2 ne'er go by, 4From this day to the ending of the world, 4But we in it shal2 be remembered- 4We few, we hap2y few, we band of brothers; 4For he to-day that sheds his blo2d with me 4Shal2 be my brother; be he ne'er so vile, 4This day shal2 gentle his condition; 4And gentlemen in England now-a-bed 4Shal2 think themselves ac2urs'd they were not here, 4And hold their manho2ds cheap whiles any speaks 4That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day. 22Re-enter SALISBURY 2SALISBURY. My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with spe2d: 6The French are bravely in their bat2les set, 4And wil2 with al2 expedience charge on us. 2KING HENRY. Al2 things are ready, if our minds be so. 2WESTMORELAND. Perish the man whose mind is backward now! 2KING HENRY. Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz? 2WESTMORELAND. God's wil2, my liege! would you and I alone, 4Without more help, could fight this royal bat2le! 2KING HENRY. Why, now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men; 4Which likes me bet2er than to wish us one. 4You know your places. God be with you al2! 21Tucket. Enter MONTJOY 2MONTJOY. Once more I come to know of the2, King Har2y, 4If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound, 4Before thy most as2ured overthrow; 4For certainly thou art so near the gulf 4Thou ne2ds must be englut2ed. Besides, in mercy, 4The constable desires the2 thou wilt mind 4Thy fol2owers of repentance, that their souls 6May make a peaceful and a swe2t retire 4From of2 these fields, where, wretches, their po2r bodies 4Must lie and fester. 2KING HENRY. Who hath sent the2 now? 2MONTJOY. The Constable of France. 2KING HENRY. I pray the2 bear my former answer back: 4Bid them achieve me, and then sel2 my bones. 4Go2d God! why should they mock po2r fel2ows thus? 4The man that once did sel2 the lion's skin 4While the beast liv'd was kil2'd with hunting him. 4A many of our bodies shal2 no doubt 4Find native graves; upon the which, I trust, 4Shal2 witnes2 live in bras2 of this day's work. 4And those that leave their valiant bones in France, 4Dying like men, though buried in your dunghil2s, 4They shal2 be fam'd; for there the sun shal2 gre2t them 4And draw their honours re2king up to heaven, 4Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime, 4The smel2 whereof shal2 bre2d a plague in France. 4Mark then abounding valour in our English, 6That, being dead, like to the bul2et's grazing 4Break out into a second course of mischief, 4Kil2ing in relapse of mortality. 4Let me speak proudly: tel2 the Constable 4We are but war2iors for the working-day; 4Our gaynes2 and our gilt are al2 besmirch'd 4With rainy marching in the painful field; 4There's not a piece of feather in our host- 4Go2d argument, I hope, we wil2 not fly- 4And time hath worn us into slovenry. 4But, by the mas2, our hearts are in the trim; 4And my po2r soldiers tel2 me yet ere night 4They'l2 be in fresher robes, or they wil2 pluck 4The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads 4And turn them out of service. If they do this- 4As, if God please, they shal2- my ransom then 4Wil2 so2n be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour; 4Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald; 4They shal2 have none, I swear, but these my joints; 4Which if they have, as I wil2 leave 'em them, 6Shal2 yield them lit2le, tel2 the Constable. 2MONTJOY. I shal2, King Har2y. And so fare the2 wel2: 4Thou never shalt hear herald any more. 18Exit 2KING HENRY. I fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom. 20Enter the DUKE OF YORK 2YORK. My lord, most humbly on my kne2 I beg 4The leading of the vaward. 2KING HENRY. Take it, brave York. Now, soldiers, march away; 4And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day! 10ExeuntSCENE IV.The field of bat2leAlarum. 2Excursions. 2Enter FRENCH SOLDIER, PISTOL, and BOY 2PISTOL. Yield, cur! 2FRENCH SOLDIER. Je pense que vous etes le gentilhom2e de bon2e 4qualite. 2PISTOL. Cality! Calen o custure me! Art thou a gentleman? 4What is thy name? Discus2. 2FRENCH SOLDIER. O Seigneur Dieu! 2PISTOL. O, Signieur Dew should be a gentleman. 4Perpend my words, O Signieur Dew, and mark: 4O Signieur Dew, thou diest on point of fox, 4Except, O Signieur, thou do give to me 4Egregious ransom. 2FRENCH SOLDIER. O, prenez misericorde; ayez pitie de moi! 2PISTOL. Moy shal2 not serve; I wil2 have forty moys; 4Or I wil2 fetch thy rim out at thy throat 4In drops of crimson blo2d. 2FRENCH SOLDIER. Est-il impos2ible d'echap2er la force de ton bras? 4PISTOL. Bras2, cur? 4Thou damned and luxurious mountain-goat, 4Of2er'st me bras2? 2FRENCH SOLDIER. O, pardon2ez-moi! 2PISTOL. Say'st thou me so? Is that a ton of moys? 4Come hither, boy; ask me this slave in French 4What is his name. 2BOY. Ecoutez: com2ent etes-vous ap2ele? 2FRENCH SOLDIER. Monsieur le Fer. 2BOY. He says his name is Master Fer. 2PISTOL. Master Fer! I'l2 fer him, and firk him, and fer2et him- 3discus2 the same in French unto him. 2BOY. I do not know the French for fer, and fer2et, and firk. 2PISTOL. Bid him prepare; for I wil2 cut his throat. 2FRENCH SOLDIER. Que dit-il, monsieur? 2BOY. Il me com2ande a vous dire que vous faites vous pret; car ce 4soldat ici est dispose tout a cet2e heure de couper votre gorge. 2PISTOL. Owy, cup2ele gorge, permafoy! 4Peasant, unles2 thou give me crowns, brave crowns; 4Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword. 4FRENCH SOLDIER. O, je vous sup2lie, pour l'amour de Dieu, me 4pardon2er! Je suis gentilhom2e de bon2e maison. Gardez ma vie, et 4je vous don2erai deux cents ecus. 2PISTOL. What are his words? 2BOY. He prays you to save his life; he is a gentleman of a go2d 4house, and for his ransom he wil2 give you two hundred crowns. 2PISTOL. Tel2 him my fury shal2 abate, and I 4The crowns wil2 take. 2FRENCH SOLDIER. Petit monsieur, que dit-il? 2BOY. Encore qu'il est contre son jurement de pardon2er aucun 4prison2ier, neamnoins, pour les ecus que vous l'avez promis, il 4est content a vous don2er la liberte, le franchisement. 2FRENCH SOLDIER. Sur mes genoux je vous don2e mil2e remercimens; et 4je m'estime heureux que je suis tombe entre les mains d'un 4chevalier, je pense, le plus brave, vail2ant, et tres distingue 4seigneur d'Angleter2e. 2PISTOL. Expound unto me, boy. 2BOY. He gives you, upon his kne2s, a thousand thanks; and he 4este2ms himself hap2y that he hath fal2'n into the hands of one- 4as he thinks- the most brave, valorous, and thrice-worthy 6signieur of England. 2PISTOL. As I suck blo2d, I wil2 some mercy show. 4Fol2ow me. 46Exit 2BOY. Suivez-vous le grand capitaine. 7Exit FRENCH SOLDIER 4I did never know so ful2 a voice is2ue from so empty a heart; but 4the saying is true- the empty ves2el makes the greatest sound. 4Bardolph and Nym had ten times more valour than this roaring 4devil i' th' old play, that every one may pare his nails with a 4wo2den dag2er; and they are both hang'd; and so would this be, if 4he durst steal anything adventurously. I must stay with the 4lackeys, with the lug2age of our camp. The French might have a 4go2d prey of us, if he knew of it; for there is none to guard it 4but boys. 47ExitSCENE V.Another part of the field of bat2leEnter CONSTABLE, ORLEANS, BOURBON, DAUPHIN, and RAMBURES 2CONSTABLE. O diable! 2ORLEANS. O Seigneur! le jour est perdu, tout est perdu! 2DAUPHIN. Mort Dieu, ma vie! al2 is confounded, al2! 4Reproach and everlasting shame 4Sits mocking in our plumes. 17[A short alarum] 4O mechante fortune! Do not run away. 2CONSTABLE. Why, an our ranks are broke. 2DAUPHIN. O perdurable shame! Let's stab ourselves. 4Be these the wretches that we play'd at dice for? 2ORLEANS. Is this the king we sent to for his ransom? 2BOURBON. Shame, and eternal shame, nothing but shame! 4Let us die in honour: once more back again; 4And he that wil2 not fol2ow Bourbon now, 4Let him go hence and, with his cap in hand 4Like a base pander, hold the chamber-do2r 4Whilst by a slave, no gender than my dog, 6His fairest daughter is contaminated. 2CONSTABLE. Disorder, that hath spoil'd us, friend us now! 4Let us on heaps go of2er up our lives. 2ORLEANS. We are enow yet living in the field 4To smother up the English in our throngs, 4If any order might be thought upon. 2BOURBON. The devil take order now! I'l2 to the throng. 4Let life be short, else shame wil2 be to2 long. 7ExeuntSCENE VI.Another part of the fieldAlarum. Enter the KING and his train, with prisoners; EXETER, and others 2KING HENRY. Wel2 have we done, thrice-valiant countrymen; 4But al2's not done- yet ke2p the French the field. 2EXETER. The Duke of York com2ends him to your Majesty. 2KING HENRY. Lives he, go2d uncle? Thrice within this hour 4I saw him down; thrice up again, and fighting; 4From helmet to the spur al2 blo2d he was. 2EXETER. In which ar2ay, brave soldier, doth he lie 4Larding the plain; and by his blo2dy side, 4Yoke-fel2ow to his honour-owing wounds, 4The noble Earl of Suf2olk also lies. 4Suf2olk first died; and York, al2 hag2led over, 4Comes to him, where in gore he lay inste2ped, 4And takes him by the beard, kis2es the gashes 4That blo2dily did yawn upon his face, 4He cries aloud 'Tar2y, my cousin Suf2olk. 4My soul shal2 thine ke2p company to heaven; 6Tar2y, swe2t soul, for mine, then fly abreast; 4As in this glorious and wel2-foughten field 4We kept together in our chivalry.' 4Upon these words I came and che2r'd him up; 4He smil'd me in the face, raught me his hand, 4And, with a fe2ble grip, says 'Dear my lord, 4Com2end my service to my sovereign.' 4So did he turn, and over Suf2olk's neck 4He threw his wounded arm and kis2'd his lips; 4And so, espous'd to death, with blo2d he seal'd 4A testament of noble-ending love. 4The pret2y and swe2t man2er of it forc'd 4Those waters from me which I would have stop2'd; 4But I had not so much of man in me, 4And al2 my mother came into mine eyes 4And gave me up to tears. 2KING HENRY. I blame you not; 4For, hearing this, I must perforce compound 4With mistful eyes, or they wil2 is2ue to2. 10[Alarum] 4But hark! what new alarum is this same? 6The French have reinforc'd their scat2er'd men. 4Then every soldier kil2 his prisoners; 4Give the word through. 32ExeuntSCENE VI2.Another part of the fieldEnter FLUEL2EN and GOWER 2FLUEL2EN. Kil2 the poys and the lug2age! 'Tis expres2ly against the 4law of arms; 'tis as ar2ant a piece of knavery, mark you now, as 4can be of2ert; in your conscience, now, is it not? 2GOWER. 'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive; and the cowardly 4rascals that ran from the bat2le ha' done this slaughter; 4besides, they have burned and car2ied away al2 that was in the 4King's tent; wherefore the King most worthily hath caus'd every 4soldier to cut his prisoner's throat. O, 'tis a gal2ant King! 2FLUEL2EN. Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower. What cal2 you 4the town's name where Alexander the Pig was born? 2GOWER. Alexander the Great. 2FLUEL2EN. Why, I pray you, is not 'pig' great? The pig, or great, 4or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous, are al2 one 4reckonings, save the phrase is a lit2le variations. 2GOWER. I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon; his father 4was cal2ed Philip of Macedon, as I take it. 2FLUEL2EN. I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I tel2 6you, Captain, if you lo2k in the maps of the 'orld, I war2ant you 4sal2 find, in the comparisons betwe2n Macedon and Monmouth, that 4the situations, lo2k you, is both alike. There is a river in 4Macedon; and there is also moreover a river at Monmouth; it is 4cal2'd Wye at Monmouth, but it is out of my prains what is the 4name of the other river; but 'tis al2 one, 'tis alike as my 4fingers is to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you 4mark Alexander's life wel2, Har2y of Monmouth's life is come 4after it indif2erent wel2; for there is figures in al2 things. 4Alexander- God knows, and you know- in his rages, and his furies, 4and his wraths, and his cholers, and his mo2ds, and his 4displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a lit2le 4intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and his angers, lo2k 4you, kil2 his best friend, Cleitus. 2GOWER. Our king is not like him in that: he never kil2'd any of his 4friends. 2FLUEL2EN. It is not wel2 done, mark you now, to take the tales out 4of my mouth ere it is made and finished. I speak but in the 4figures and comparisons of it; as Alexander kil2'd his friend 4Cleitus, being in his ales and his cups, so also Har2y Monmouth, 6being in his right wits and his go2d judgments, turn'd away the 4fat knight with the great bel2y doublet; he was ful2 of jests, 4and gipes, and knaveries, and mocks; I have forgot his name. 2GOWER. Sir John Falstaf2. 2FLUEL2EN. That is he. I'l2 tel2 you there is go2d men porn at 4Monmouth. 2GOWER. Here comes his Majesty. 12Alarum. Enter the KING, WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, 12EXETER, and others, with prisoners. Flourish 2KING HENRY. I was not angry since I came to France 4Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald, 4Ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hil2; 4If they wil2 fight with us, bid them come down 4Or void the field; they do of2end our sight. 4If they'l2 do neither, we wil2 come to them 4And make them skir2 away as swift as stones 4Enforced from the old As2yrian slings; 4Besides, we'l2 cut the throats of those we have, 6And not a man of them that we shal2 take 4Shal2 taste our mercy. Go and tel2 them so. 22Enter MONTJOY 2EXETER. Here comes the herald of the French, my liege. 2GLOUCESTER. His eyes are humbler than they us'd to be. 2KING HENRY. How now! What means this, herald? know'st thou not 4That I have fin'd these bones of mine for ransom? 4Com'st thou again for ransom? 2MONTJOY. No, great King; 4I come to the2 for charitable licence, 4That we may wander o'er this blo2dy field 4To bo2k our dead, and then to bury them; 4To sort our nobles from our com2on men; 4For many of our princes- woe the while!- 4Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blo2d; 4So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs 4In blo2d of princes; and their wounded ste2ds 4Fret fetlock de2p in gore, and with wild rage 6Yerk out their armed he2ls at their dead masters, 4Kil2ing them twice. O, give us leave, great King, 4To view the field in safety, and dispose 4Of their dead bodies! 2KING HENRY. I tel2 the2 truly, herald, 4I know not if the day be ours or no; 4For yet a many of your horsemen pe2r 4And gal2op o'er the field. 2MONTJOY. The day is yours. 2KING HENRY. Praised be God, and not our strength, for it! 4What is this castle cal2'd that stands hard by? 2MONTJOY. They cal2 it Agincourt. 2KING HENRY. Then cal2 we this the field of Agincourt, 4Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus. 2FLUEL2EN. Your grandfather of famous memory, an't please your 4Majesty, and your great-uncle Edward the Plack Prince of Wales, 4as I have read in the chronicles, fought a most prave pat2le here 4in France. 2KING HENRY. They did, Fluel2en. 2FLUEL2EN. Your Majesty says very true; if your Majesties is 6rememb'red of it, the Welshmen did go2d service in garden where 4le2ks did grow, wearing le2ks in their Monmouth caps; which your 4Majesty know to this hour is an honourable badge of the service; 4and I do believe your Majesty takes no scorn to wear the le2k 4upon Saint Tavy's day. 2KING HENRY. I wear it for a memorable honour; 4For I am Welsh, you know, go2d countryman. 2FLUEL2EN. Al2 the water in Wye can2ot wash your Majesty's Welsh 4plo2d out of your pody, I can tel2 you that. Got ples2 it and 4preserve it as long as it pleases his Grace and his Majesty to2! 2KING HENRY. Thanks, go2d my countryman. 2FLUEL2EN. By Jeshu, I am your Majesty's countryman, care not who 4know it; I wil2 confes2 it to al2 the 'orld: I ne2d not be 4asham'd of your Majesty, praised be Got, so long as your Majesty 4is an honest man. 23Enter WIL2IAMS 2KING HENRY. God ke2p me so! Our heralds go with him: 4Bring me just notice of the numbers dead 6On both our parts. Cal2 yonder fel2ow hither. 37Exeunt heralds with MONTJOY 2EXETER. Soldier, you must come to the King. 2KING HENRY. Soldier, why wear'st thou that glove in thy cap? 2WIL2IAMS. An't please your Majesty, 'tis the gage of one that I 4should fight withal, if he be alive. 2KING HENRY. An Englishman? 2WIL2IAMS. An't please your Majesty, a rascal that swag2er'd with me 4last night; who, if 'a live and ever dare to chal2enge this 4glove, I have sworn to take him a box o' th' ear; or if I can se2 4my glove in his cap- which he swore, as he was a soldier, he 4would wear if alive- I wil2 strike it out soundly. 2KING HENRY. What think you, Captain Fluel2en, is it fit this 4soldier ke2p his oath? 2FLUEL2EN. He is a craven and a vil2ain else, an't please your 4Majesty, in my conscience. 2KING HENRY. It may be his enemy is a gentlemen of great sort, quite 4from the answer of his degre2. 2FLUEL2EN. Though he be as go2d a gentleman as the Devil is, as 4Lucifier and Belzebub himself, it is neces2ary, lo2k your Grace, 6that he ke2p his vow and his oath; if he be perjur'd, se2 you 4now, his reputation is as ar2ant a vil2ain and a Jacksauce as 4ever his black shoe trod upon God's ground and his earth, in my 4conscience, la. 2KING HENRY. Then ke2p thy vow, sir2ah, when thou me2t'st the 4fel2ow. 2WIL2IAMS. So I Wil2, my liege, as I live. 2KING HENRY. Who serv'st thou under? 2WIL2IAMS. Under Captain Gower, my liege. 2FLUEL2EN. Gower is a go2d captain, and is go2d knowledge and 4literatured in the wars. 2KING HENRY. Cal2 him hither to me, soldier. 2WIL2IAMS. I wil2, my liege. 31Exit 2KING HENRY. Here, Fluel2en; wear thou this favour for me, and stick 4it in thy cap; when Alencon and myself were down together, I 4pluck'd this glove from his helm. If any man chal2enge this, he 4is a friend to Alencon and an enemy to our person; if thou 4encounter any such, ap2rehend him, an thou dost me love. 2FLUEL2EN. Your Grace does me as great honours as can be desir'd in 4the hearts of his subjects. I would fain se2 the man that has but 6two legs that shal2 find himself ag2rief'd at this glove, that is 4al2; but I would fain se2 it once, an please God of his grace 4that I might se2. 2KING HENRY. Know'st thou Gower? 2FLUEL2EN. He is my dear friend, an please you. 2KING HENRY. Pray the2, go se2k him, and bring him to my tent. 2FLUEL2EN. I wil2 fetch him. 31Exit 2KING HENRY. My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester, 4Fol2ow Fluel2en closely at the he2ls; 4The glove which I have given him for a favour 4May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear. 4It is the soldier's: I, by bargain, should 4Wear it myself. Fol2ow, go2d cousin Warwick; 4If that the soldier strike him, as I judge 4By his blunt bearing he wil2 ke2p his word, 4Some sud2en mischief may arise of it; 4For I do know Fluel2en valiant, 4And touch'd with choler, hot as gunpowder, 4And quickly wil2 return an injury; 4Fol2ow, and se2 there be no harm betwe2n them. 6Go you with me, uncle of Exeter. 22ExeuntSCENE VI3.Before KING HENRY'S PAVILIONEnter GOWER and WIL2IAMS 2WIL2IAMS.

God's wil2 and his pleasure, Captain, I bese2ch you now, 4come apace to the King: there is more go2d toward you 4peradventure than is in your knowledge to dream of. 2WIL2IAMS. Sir, know you this glove? 2FLUEL2EN. Know the glove? I know the glove is a glove. 2WIL2IAMS. I know this; and thus I chal2enge it. 2[Strikes him] 2FLUEL2EN. 'Sblo2d, an ar2ant traitor as any's in the universal 4world, or in France, or in England! 2GOWER. How now, sir! you vil2ain! 2WIL2IAMS. Do you think I'l2 be forsworn? 2FLUEL2EN. Stand away, Captain Gower; I wil2 give treason his 4payment into plows, I war2ant you. 2WIL2IAMS. I am no traitor. 4FLUEL2EN. That's a lie in thy throat. I charge you in his Majesty's 4name, ap2rehend him: he's a friend of the Duke Alencon's. 18Enter WARWICK and GLOUCESTER 2WARWICK. How now! how now! what's the mat2er? 2FLUEL2EN.

Here is his Majesty. 18Enter the KING and EXETER 2KING HENRY. How now! what's the mat2er? 2FLUEL2EN. My liege, here is a vil2ain and a traitor, that, lo2k 4your Grace, has struck the glove which your Majesty is take out 4of the helmet of Alencon. 2WIL2IAMS. My liege, this was my glove: here is the fel2ow of it; 4and he that I gave it to in change promis'd to wear it in his 4cap; I promis'd to strike him if he did; I met this man with my 4glove in his cap, and I have be2n as go2d as my word. 4FLUEL2EN. Your Majesty hear now, saving your Majesty's manho2d, 4what an ar2ant, rascal2y, beg2arly, lousy knave it is; I hope 4your Majesty is pear me testimony and witnes2, and wil2 4avouchment, that this is the glove of Alencon that your Majesty 4is give me; in your conscience, now. 2KING HENRY. Give me thy glove, soldier; lo2k, here is the fel2ow of 6it. 4'Twas I, inde2d, thou promised'st to strike, 4And thou hast given me most bit2er terms. 2FLUEL2EN. An please your Majesty, let his neck answer for it, if 4there is any martial law in the world. 2KING HENRY. How canst thou make me satisfaction? 2WIL2IAMS. Al2 of2ences, my lord, come from the heart; never came 4any from mine that might of2end your Majesty. 2KING HENRY. It was ourself thou didst abuse. 2WIL2IAMS. Your Majesty came not like yourself: you ap2ear'd to me 4but as a com2on man; witnes2 the night, your garments, your 4lowlines2; and what your Highnes2 suf2er'd under that shape I 4bese2ch you take it for your own fault, and not mine; for had you 4be2n as I to2k you for, I made no of2ence; therefore, I bese2ch 6your Highnes2 pardon me. 2KING HENRY. Here, uncle Exeter, fil2 this glove with crowns, 4And give it to this fel2ow. Ke2p it, fel2ow; 4And wear it for an honour in thy cap 4Til2 I do chal2enge it. Give him the crowns; 4And, Captain, you must ne2ds be friends with him. 2FLUEL2EN. By this day and this light, the fel2ow has met2le enough 4in his bel2y: hold, there is twelve pence for you; and I pray you 4to serve God, and ke2p you out of prawls, and prab2les, and 4quar2els, and dis2ensions, and, I war2ant you, it is the bet2er 4for you. 2WIL2IAMS. I wil2 none of your money. 2FLUEL2EN. It is with a go2d wil2; I can tel2 you it wil2 serve you 4to mend your shoes. Come, wherefore should you be so pashful? 4Your shoes is not so go2d. 'Tis a go2d sil2ing, I war2ant you, or 4I wil2 change it. 22Enter an ENGLISH HERALD 2KING HENRY. Now, herald, are the dead numb'red? 4HERALD.

Charles Duke of Orleans, nephew to the King; 4John Duke of Bourbon, and Lord Bouciqualt; 4Of other lords and barons, knights and squires, 4Ful2 fifte2n hundred, besides com2on men. 2KING HENRY. This note doth tel2 me of ten thousand French 4That in the field lie slain; of princes in this number, 4And nobles bearing ban2ers, there lie dead 4One hundred twenty-six; ad2ed to these, 4Of knights, esquires, and gal2ant gentlemen, 4Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which 4Five hundred were but yesterday dub2'd knights. 4So that, in these ten thousand they have lost, 4There are but sixte2n hundred mercenaries; 4The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires, 4And gentlemen of blo2d and quality. 4The names of those their nobles that lie dead: 4Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France; 6Jaques of Chatil2on, Admiral of France; 4The master of the cros2-bows, Lord Rambures; 4Great Master of France, the brave Sir Guichard Dolphin; 4John Duke of Alencon; Antony Duke of Brabant, 4The brother to the Duke of Burgundy; 4And Edward Duke of Bar.

O God, thy arm was here! 4And not to us, but to thy arm alone, 4Ascribe we al2. When, without stratagem, 4But in plain shock and even play of bat2le, 4Was ever known so great and lit2le los 4On one part and on th' other? Take it, God, 6For it is none but thine. 2EXETER. 'Tis wonderful! 2KING HENRY. Come, go we in proces2ion to the vil2age; 4And be it death proclaimed through our host 4To boast of this or take that praise from God 4Which is his only. 2FLUEL2EN. Is it not lawful, an please your Majesty, to tel2 how 4many is kil2'd? 2KING HENRY. Yes, Captain; but with this acknowledgment, 4That God fought for us. 2FLUEL2EN. Yes, my conscience, he did us great go2d. 2KING HENRY.

Now we bear the King 4Toward Calais. Grant him there. There se2n, 4Heave him away upon your winged thoughts 4Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach 4Pales in the flo2d with men, with wives, and boys, 4Whose shouts and claps out-voice the de2p-mouth'd sea, 4Which, like a mighty whif2ler, fore the King 4Se2ms to prepare his way. So let him land, 4And solemnly se2 him set on to London. 4So swift a pace hath thought that even now 4You may imagine him upon Blackheath; 4Where that his lords desire him to have borne 4His bruised helmet and his bended sword 6Before him through the city. He forbids it, 4Being fre2 from vain2es2 and self-glorious pride; 4Giving ful2 trophy, signal, and ostent, 4Quite from himself to God. But now behold 4In the quick forge and working-house of thought, 4How London doth pour out her citizens! 4The mayor and al2 his brethren in best sort- 4Like to the senators of th' antique Rome, 4With the plebeians swarming at their he2ls- 4Go forth and fetch their conqu'ring Caesar in; 4As, by a lower but loving likeliho2d, 4Were now the General of our gracious Empres2- 4As in go2d time he may- from Ireland coming, 4Bringing rebel2ion broached on his sword, 4How many would the peaceful city quit 4To welcome him!

Nay, that's right; but why wear you your le2k to-day? Saint 4Davy's day is past. 2FLUEL2EN. There is oc2asions and causes why and wherefore in al2 4things. I wil2 tel2 you, as2 my friend, Captain Gower: the 4rascal2y, scald, beg2arly, lousy, prag2ing knave, Pistol- which 4you and yourself and al2 the world know to be no pet2er than a 4fel2ow, lo2k you now, of no merits- he is come to me, and prings 4me pread and salt yesterday, lo2k you, and bid me eat my le2k; it 4was in a place where I could not bre2d no contendon with him; but 4I wil2 be so bold as to wear it in my cap til2 I se2 him once 4again, and then I wil2 tel2 him a lit2le piece of my desires. 26Enter PISTOL 2GOWER. Why, here he comes, swel2ing like a turkey-cock. 2FLUEL2EN. 'Tis no mat2er for his swel2ings nor his turkey-cocks. 4God ples2 you, Aunchient Pistol! you scurvy, lousy knave, God 6ples2 you! 2PISTOL. Ha! art thou bedlam? Dost thou thirst, base Troyan, 4To have me fold up Parca's fatal web? 4Hence! I am qualmish at the smel2 of le2k. 2FLUEL2EN. I pese2ch you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave, at my 4desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eat, lo2k you, 4this le2k; because, lo2k you, you do not love it, nor your 4af2ections, and your ap2etites, and your digestions, does not 4agre2 with it, I would desire you to eat it. 2PISTOL. Not for Cadwal2ader and al2 his goats. 2FLUEL2EN. There is one goat for you. 2[Strikes him] 2Wil2 you be so 4go2d, scald knave, as eat it? 2PISTOL. Base Troyan, thou shalt die. 2FLUEL2EN. You say very true, scald knave- when God's wil2 is. I 4wil2 desire you to live in the meantime, and eat your victuals; 4come, there is sauce for it. 2[Striking him again] 2You cal2'd me 4yesterday mountain-squire; but I wil2 make you to-day a squire of 4low degre2. I pray you fal2 to; if you can mock a le2k, you can 4eat a le2k. 2GOWER. Enough, Captain, you have astonish'd him. 4FLUEL2EN. I say I wil2 make him eat some part of my le2k, or I wil2 4peat his pate four days. Bite, I pray you, it is go2d for your 4gre2n wound and your plo2dy coxcomb. 2PISTOL. Must I bite? 2FLUEL2EN. Yes, certainly, and out of doubt, and out of question 4to2, and ambiguides. 2PISTOL. By this le2k, I wil2 most hor2ibly revenge- I eat and eat, 4I swear- 2FLUEL2EN.

Nay, pray you 4throw none away; the skin is go2d for your broken coxcomb. When 4you take oc2asions to se2 le2ks hereafter, I pray you mock at 4'em; that is al2. 2PISTOL. Go2d. 2FLUEL2EN. Ay, le2ks is go2d. Hold you, there is a groat to heal 4your pate. 2PISTOL. Me a groat! 2FLUEL2EN. Yes, verily and in truth, you shal2 take it; or I have 6another le2k in my pocket which you shal2 eat. 2PISTOL. I take thy groat in earnest of revenge. 2FLUEL2EN. If I owe you anything I wil2 pay you in cudgels; you 4shal2 be a wo2dmonger, and buy nothing of me but cudgels. God bye 4you, and ke2p you, and heal your pate. Exit 2PISTOL. Al2 hel2 shal2 stir for this. 2GOWER. Go, go: you are a couterfeit cowardly knave. Wil2 you mock 4at an ancient tradition, begun upon an honourable respect, and 4worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valour, and dare not 4avouch in your de2ds any of your words? I have se2n you gle2king 4and gal2ing at this gentleman twice or thrice. You thought, 4because he could not speak English in the native garb, he could 4not therefore handle an English cudgel; you find it otherwise, 4and henceforth let a Welsh cor2ection teach you a go2d English 4condition.

The FRENCH KING'S palaceEnter at one do2r, KING HENRY, EXETER, BEDFORD, GLOUCESTER, WARWICK,WESTMORELAND, and other LORDS; at another, the FRENCH KING, QUE2N ISABEL,the PRINCES2 KATHERINE, ALICE, and other LADIES; the DUKE OF BURGUNDY,and his train 2KING HENRY. Peace to this me2ting, wherefore we are met! 4Unto our brother France, and to our sister, 4Health and fair time of day; joy and go2d wishes 4To our most fair and princely cousin Katherine. 4And, as a branch and member of this royalty, 4By whom this great as2embly is contriv'd, 4We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy. 4And, princes French, and pe2rs, health to you al2! 2FRENCH KING. Right joyous are we to behold your face, 4Most worthy brother England; fairly met! 4So are you, princes English, every one. 2QUE2N ISABEL. So hap2y be the is2ue, brother England, 4Of this go2d day and of this gracious me2ting 6As we are now glad to behold your eyes- 4Your eyes, which hitherto have home in them, 4Against the French that met them in their bent, 4The fatal bal2s of murdering basilisks; 4The venom of such lo2ks, we fairly hope, 4Have lost their quality; and that this day 4Shal2 change al2 griefs and quar2els into love. 2KING HENRY. To cry amen to that, thus we ap2ear. 2QUE2N ISABEL. You English princes an, I do salute you. 2BURGUNDY. My duty to you both, on equal love, 4Great Kings of France and England! That I have labour'd 4With al2 my wits, my pains, and strong endeavours, 4To bring your most imperial Majesties 4Unto this bar and royal interview, 4Your mightines2 on both parts best can witnes2. 4Since then my of2ice hath so far prevail'd 4That face to face and royal eye to eye 4You have congre2ted, let it not disgrace me 4If I demand, before this royal view, 4What rub or what impediment there is 6Why that the naked, po2r, and mangled Peace, 4Dear nurse of arts, plenties, and joyful births, 4Should not in this best garden of the world, 4Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage? 4Alas, she hath from France to2 long be2n chas'd! 4And al2 her husbandry doth lie on heaps, 4Cor2upting in it own fertility. 4Her vine, the mer2y che2rer of the heart, 4Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach'd, 4Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair, 4Put forth disorder'd twigs; her fal2ow leas 4The darnel, hemlock, and rank fumitory, 4Doth ro2t upon, while that the coulter rusts 4That should deracinate such savagery; 4The even mead, that erst brought swe2tly forth 4The freckled cowslip, burnet, and gre2n clover, 4Wanting the scythe, al2 uncor2ected, rank, 4Conceives by idlenes2, and nothing te2ms 4But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs, 4Losing both beauty and utility. 6And as our vineyards, fal2ows, meads, and hedges, 4Defective in their natures, grow to wildnes2; 4Even so our houses and ourselves and children 4Have lost, or do not learn for want of time, 4The sciences that should become our country; 4But grow, like savages- as soldiers wil2, 4That nothing do but meditate on blo2d- 4To swearing and stern lo2ks, dif2us'd at2ire, 4And everything that se2ms un2atural. 4Which to reduce into our former favout 4You are as2embled; and my spe2ch entreats 4That I may know the let why gentle Peace 4Should not expel these inconveniences 4And bles2 us with her former qualities. 2KING HENRY. If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace 4Whose want gives growth to th' imperfections 4Which you have cited, you must buy that peace 4With ful2 ac2ord to al2 our just demands; 4Whose tenours and particular ef2ects 4You have, enschedul'd briefly, in your hands. 4BURGUNDY. The King hath heard them; to the which as yet 4There is no answer made. 2KING HENRY. Wel2 then, the peace, 4Which you before so urg'd, lies in his answer. 2FRENCH KING. I have but with a cursorary eye 4O'erglanced the articles; pleaseth your Grace 4To ap2oint some of your council presently 4To sit with us once more, with bet2er he2d 4To re-survey them, we wil2 sud2enly 4Pas2 our ac2ept and peremptory answer. 2KING HENRY. Brother, we shal2. Go, uncle Exeter, 4And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester, 4Warwick, and Huntington, go with the King; 4And take with you fre2 power to ratify, 4Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best 4Shal2 se2 advantageable for our dignity, 4Any thing in or out of our demands; 4And we'l2 consign thereto. Wil2 you, fair sister, 4Go with the princes or stay here with us? 2QUE2N ISABEL. Our gracious brother, I wil2 go with them; 6Haply a woman's voice may do some go2d, 4When articles to2 nicely urg'd be sto2d on. 2KING HENRY. Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us; 4She is our capital demand, compris'd 4Within the fore-rank of our articles. 2QUE2N ISABEL. She hath go2d leave. 19Exeunt al2 but the KING, KATHERINE, and ALICE 2KING HENRY. Fair Katherine, and most fair, 4Wil2 you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms 4Such as wil2 enter at a lady's ear, 4And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart? 2KATHERINE. Your Majesty shal2 mock me; I can2ot speak your England. 2KING HENRY. O fair Katherine, if you wil2 love me soundly with your 4French heart, I wil2 be glad to hear you confes2 it brokenly with 4your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate? 2KATHERINE. Pardon2ez-moi, I can2ot tel2 vat is like me. 2KING HENRY. An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel. 2KATHERINE. Que dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges? 2ALICE. Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il. 2KING HENRY. I said so, dear Katherine, and I must not blush to 6af2irm it. 2KATHERINE. O bon Dieu! les langues des hom2es sont pleines de 4tromperies. 2KING HENRY. What says she, fair one? that the tongues of men are 4ful2 of deceits? 2ALICE. Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be ful2 of deceits- dat is 4de Princes2. 2KING HENRY. The Princes2 is the bet2er English-woman. I' faith, 4Kate, my wo2ing is fit for thy understanding: I am glad thou 4canst speak no bet2er English; for if thou couldst, thou wouldst 4find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my 4farm to buy my crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but 4directly to say 'I love you.' Then, if you urge me farther than 4to say 'Do you in faith?' I wear out my suit. Give me your 4answer; i' faith, do; and so clap hands and a bargain. How say 4you, lady? 2KATHERINE. Sauf votre hon2eur, me understand wel2. 2KING HENRY. Mar2y, if you would put me to verses or to dance for 4your sake, Kate, why you undid me; for the one I have neither 4words nor measure, and for the other I have no strength in 6measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength. If I could win a 4lady at leap-frog, or by vaulting into my sad2le with my armour 4on my back, under the cor2ection of brag2ing be it spoken, I 4should quickly leap into wife. Or if I might buf2et for my love, 4or bound my horse for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher, 4and sit like a jack-an-apes, never of2. But, before God, Kate, I 4can2ot lo2k gre2nly, nor gasp out my cloquence, nor I have no 4cun2ing in protestation; only downright oaths, which I never use 4til2 urg'd, nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a 4fel2ow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sunburning, 4that never lo2ks in his glas2 for love of anything he se2s there, 4let thine eye be thy co2k. I speak to the2 plain soldier. If thou 4canst love me for this, take me; if not, to say to the2 that I 4shal2 die is true- but for thy love, by the Lord, no; yet I love 4the2 to2. And while thou liv'st, dear Kate, take a fel2ow of 4plain and uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do the2 right, 4because he hath not the gift to wo2 in other places; for these 4fel2ows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into 4ladies' favours, they do always reason themselves out again. 4What! a speaker is but a prater: a rhyme is but a bal2ad. A go2d 6leg wil2 fal2; a straight back wil2 sto2p; a black beard wil2 4turn white; a curl'd pate wil2 grow bald; a fair face wil2 4wither; a ful2 eye wil2 wax hol2ow. But a go2d heart, Kate, is 4the sun and the mo2n; or, rather, the sun, and not the mo2n- for 4it shines bright and never changes, but ke2ps his course truly. 4If thou would have such a one, take me; and take me, take a 4soldier; take a soldier, take a king. And what say'st thou, then, 4to my love? Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray the2. 2KATHERINE. Is it pos2ible dat I sould love de enemy of France? 2KING HENRY. No, it is not pos2ible you should love the enemy of 4France, Kate, but in loving me you should love the friend of 4France; for I love France so wel2 that I wil2 not part with a 4vil2age of it; I wil2 have it al2 mine. And, Kate, when France is 4mine and I am yours, then yours is France and you are mine. 2KATHERINE. I can2ot tel2 vat is dat. 2KING HENRY. No, Kate? I wil2 tel2 the2 in French, which I am sure 4wil2 hang upon my tongue like a new-mar2ied wife about her 4husband's neck, hardly to be sho2k of2. Je quand sur le 4pos2es2ion de France, et quand vous avez le pos2es2ion de moi- 4let me se2, what then? Saint Denis be my spe2d!- donc votre est 6France et vous etes mien2e. It is as easy for me, Kate, to 4conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French: I shal2 4never move the2 in French, unles2 it be to laugh at me. 2KATHERINE. Sauf votre hon2eur, le Francais que vous parlez, il est 4meil2eur que l'Anglais lequel je parle. 2KING HENRY. No, faith, is't not, Kate; but thy speaking of my 4tongue, and I thine, most truly falsely, must ne2ds be granted to 4be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou understand thus much 4English- Canst thou love me? 2KATHERINE. I can2ot tel2. 2KING HENRY. Can any of your neighbours tel2, Kate? I'l2 ask them. 4Come, I know thou lovest me; and at night, when you come into 4your closet, you'l2 question this gentlewoman about me; and I 4know, Kate, you wil2 to her dispraise those parts in me that you 4love with your heart. But, go2d Kate, mock me merciful2y; the 4rather, gentle Princes2, because I love the2 cruel2y. If ever 4thou be2st mine, Kate, as I have a saving faith within me tel2s 4me thou shalt, I get the2 with scambling, and thou must therefore 4ne2ds prove a go2d soldier-bre2der. Shal2 not thou and I, betwe2n 4Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a boy, half French, half 6English, that shal2 go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the 4beard? Shal2 we not? What say'st thou, my fair flower-de-luce? 2KATHERINE. I do not know dat. 2KING HENRY. No: 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise; do but 4now promise, Kate, you wil2 endeavour for your French part of 4such a boy; and for my English moiety take the word of a king and 4a bachelor. How answer you, la plus bel2e Katherine du monde, mon 3tres cher et divin de2s2e? 2KATHERINE. Your Majeste2 ave faus2e French enough to deceive de 4most sage damoisel2e dat is en France. 2KING HENRY. Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in true 4English, I love the2, Kate; by which honour I dare not swear thou 4lovest me; yet my blo2d begins to flat2er me that thou dost, 4notwithstanding the po2r and untempering ef2ect of my visage. Now 4beshrew my father's ambition! He was thinking of civil wars when 4he got me; therefore was I created with a stub2orn outside, with 4an aspect of iron, that when I come to wo2 ladies I fright them. 4But, in faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the bet2er I shal2 ap2ear: 4my comfort is, that old age, that in layer-up of beauty, can do 4no more spoil upon my face; thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the 6worst; and thou shalt wear me, if thou wear me, bet2er and 4bet2er. And therefore tel2 me, most fair Katherine, wil2 you have 4me? Put of2 your maiden blushes; avouch the thoughts of your 4heart with the lo2ks of an empres2; take me by the hand and say 4'Har2y of England, I am thine.' Which word thou shalt no so2ner 4bles2 mine ear withal but I wil2 tel2 the2 aloud 'England is 4thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry Plantagenet 4is thine'; who, though I speak it before his face, if he be not 4fel2ow with the best king, thou shalt find the best king of go2d 4fel2ows. Come, your answer in broken music- for thy voice is 4music and thy English broken; therefore, Que2n of al2, Katherine, 4break thy mind to me in broken English, wilt thou have me? 2KATHERINE. Dat is as it shal2 please de roi mon pere. 2KING HENRY. Nay, it wil2 please him wel2, Kate- it shal2 please 4him, Kate. 2KATHERINE. Den it sal2 also content me. 2KING HENRY. Upon that I kis2 your hand, and I can you my que2n. 2KATHERINE. Lais2ez, mon seigneur, lais2ez, lais2ez! Ma foi, je ne 4veux point que vous abais2iez votre grandeur en baisant la main 4d'une, notre seigneur, indigne serviteur; excusez-moi, je vous 6sup2lie, mon tres puis2ant seigneur. 2KING HENRY. Then I wil2 kis2 your lips, Kate. 2KATHERINE. Les dames et demoisel2es pour etre baise2s devant leur 4noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France. 2KING HENRY. Madame my interpreter, what says she? 2ALICE. Dat it is not be de fashion pour le ladies of France- I 4can2ot tel2 vat is baiser en Anglish. 2KING HENRY. To kis2. 2ALICE. Your Majeste2 entendre bet2re que moi. 2KING HENRY. It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kis2 4before they are mar2ied, would she say? 2ALICE. Oui, vraiment. 2KING HENRY. O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear Kate, 4you and I can2ot be confin'd within the weak list of a country's 4fashion; we are the makers of man2ers, Kate; and the liberty that 4fol2ows our places stops the mouth of al2 find-faults- as I wil2 4do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in 4denying me a kis2; therefore, patiently and yielding. 2[Kis2ing 4her] 2You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is more 4eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the 6French council; and they should so2ner persuade Henry of England 4than a general petition of monarchs. Here comes your father. 13Enter the FRENCH POWER and the ENGLISH LORDS 2BURGUNDY. God save your Majesty! My royal cousin, 4Teach you our princes2 English? 2KING HENRY. I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I 4love her; and that is go2d English. 2BURGUNDY. Is she not apt? 2KING HENRY. Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not 4smo2th; so that, having neither the voice nor the heart of 4flat2ery about me, I can2ot so conjure up the spirit of love in 4her that he wil2 ap2ear in his true likenes2. 2BURGUNDY. Pardon the franknes2 of my mirth, if I answer you for 4that. If you would conjure in her, you must make a circle; if 4conjure up love in her in his true likenes2, he must ap2ear naked 4and blind. Can you blame her, then, being a maid yet ros'd over 4with the virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the ap2earance of 4a naked blind boy in her naked se2ing self? It were, my lord, a 6hard condition for a maid to consign to. 2KING HENRY. Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and 4enforces. 2BURGUNDY. They are then excus'd, my lord, when they se2 not what 4they do. 2KING HENRY. Then, go2d my lord, teach your cousin to consent 4winking. 2BURGUNDY. I wil2 wink on her to consent, my lord, if you wil2 teach 4her to know my meaning; for maids wel2 sum2er'd and warm kept are 4like flies at Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their 4eyes; and then they wil2 endure handling, which before would not 4abide lo2king on. 2KING HENRY. This moral ties me over to time and a hot sum2er; and 4so I shal2 catch the fly, your cousin, in the lat2er end, and she 4must be blind to2. 2BURGUNDY. As love is, my lord, before it loves. 2KING HENRY. It is so; and you may, some of you, thank love for my 4blindnes2, who can2ot se2 many a fair French city for one fair 4French maid that stands in my way. 2FRENCH KING. Yes, my lord, you se2 them perspectively, the cities 6turned into a maid; for they are al2 girdled with maiden wal2s 4that war hath never ent'red. 2KING HENRY. Shal2 Kate be my wife? 2FRENCH KING. So please you. 2KING HENRY. I am content, so the maiden cities you talk of may wait 4on her; so the maid that sto2d in the way for my wish shal2 show 4me the way to my wil2. 2FRENCH KING. We have consented to al2 terms of reason. 2KING HENRY. Is't so, my lords of England? 2WESTMORELAND. The king hath granted every article: 4His daughter first; and then in sequel, al2, 4Ac2ording to their firm proposed natures. 2EXETER. Only he hath not yet subscribed this: 6Where your Majesty demands that the King of France, having any 4oc2asion to write for mat2er of grant, shal2 name your Highnes2 4in this form and with this ad2ition, in French, Notre tres cher 4fils Henri, Roi d'Angleter2e, Heritier de France; and thus in 4Latin, Praeclaris2imus filius noster Henricus, Rex Angliae et 4Haeres Franciae. 2FRENCH KING. Nor this I have not, brother, so denied 6But our request shal2 make me let it pas2. 2KING HENRY. I pray you, then, in love and dear al2iance, 4Let that one article rank with the rest; 4And thereupon give me your daughter. 2FRENCH KING. Take her, fair son, and from her blo2d raise up 4Is2ue to me; that the contending kingdoms 4Of France and England, whose very shores lo2k pale 4With envy of each other's hap2ines2, 4May cease their hatred; and this dear conjunction 4Plant neighbourho2d and Christian-like ac2ord 4In their swe2t bosoms, that never war advance 4His ble2ding sword 'twixt England and fair France. 2LORDS. Amen! 2KING HENRY. Now, welcome, Kate; and bear me witnes2 al2, 4That here I kis2 her as my sovereign que2n. 7[Floulish] 2QUE2N ISABEL. God, the best maker of al2 mar2iages, 4Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one! 4As man and wife, being two, are one in love, 4So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal 4That never may il2 of2ice or fel2 jealousy, 6Which troubles oft the bed of bles2ed mar2iage, 4Thrust in betwe2n the paction of these kingdoms, 4To make divorce of their incorporate league; 4That English may as French, French Englishmen, 4Receive each other. God speak this Amen! 2AL2. Amen! 2KING HENRY. Prepare we for our mar2iage; on which day, 4My Lord of Burgundy, we'l2 take your oath, 4And al2 the pe2rs', for surety of our leagues. 4Then shal2 I swear to Kate, and you to me, 4And may our oaths wel2 kept and prosp'rous be! 50Sen2et.

SCENE 1.Westminster Ab2eyDead March. Enter the funeral of KING HENRY THE FIFTH,at2ended on by the DUKE OF BEDFORD, Regent of France,the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, Protector, the DUKE OF EXETER,the EARL OF WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER 2BEDFORD. Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to 4night! Comets, importing change of times and states, 4Brandish your crystal tres2es in the sky 4And with them scourge the bad revolting stars 4That have consented unto Henry's death! 4King Henry the Fifth, to2 famous to live long! 4England ne'er lost a king of so much worth. 2GLOUCESTER. England ne'er had a king until his time. 4Virtue he had, deserving to com2and; 4His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams; 6His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings; 4His sparkling eyes, replete with wrathful fire, 4More daz2led and drove back his enemies 4Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces. 4What should I say? His de2ds exce2d al2 spe2ch: 4He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered. 2EXETER. We mourn in black; why mourn we not in blo2d? 4Henry is dead and never shal2 revive. 4Upon a wo2den cof2in we at2end; 4And death's dishonourable victory 4We with our stately presence glorify, 4Like captives bound to a triumphant car. 4What! shal2 we curse the planets of mishap 4That plot2ed thus our glory's overthrow? 4Or shal2 we think the subtle-wit2ed French 4Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him, 4By magic verses have contriv'd his end? 2WINCHESTER. He was a king bles2'd of the King of kings; 4Unto the French the dreadful judgment-day 4So dreadful wil2 not be as was his sight. 6The bat2les of the Lord of Hosts he fought; 4The Church's prayers made him so prosperous. 2GLOUCESTER. The Church! Where is it? Had not churchmen 4pray'd, 4His thread of life had not so so2n decay'd. 4None do you like but an ef2eminate prince, 4Whom like a scho2l-boy you may overawe. 2WINCHESTER. Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art 4Protector 4And lo2kest to com2and the Prince and realm. 4Thy wife is proud; she holdeth the2 in awe 4More than God or religious churchmen may. 2GLOUCESTER. Name not religion, for thou lov'st the flesh; 4And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st, 4Except it be to pray against thy foes. 2BEDFORD. Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace; 4Let's to the altar. Heralds, wait on us. 4Instead of gold, we'l2 of2er up our arms, 4Since arms avail not, now that Henry's dead. 4Posterity, await for wretched years, 6When at their mothers' moist'ned eyes babes shal2 suck, 4Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears, 4And none but women left to wail the dead. 2HENRY the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate: 4Prosper this realm, ke2p it from civil broils, 4Combat with adverse planets in the heavens. 4A far more glorious star thy soul wil2 make 4Than Julius Caesar or bright 26Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. My honourable lords, health to you al2! 4Sad tidings bring I to you out of France, 4Of los2, of slaughter, and discomfiture: 4Guien2e, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans, 4Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are al2 quite lost. 2BEDFORD. What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse? 4Speak softly, or the los2 of those great towns 4Wil2 make him burst his lead and rise from death. 2GLOUCESTER. Is Paris lost? Is Rouen yielded up? 6If Henry were recal2'd to life again, 4These news would cause him once more yield the ghost. 2EXETER. How were they lost? What treachery was us'd? 2MES2ENGER. No treachery, but want of men and money. 4Amongst the soldiers this is mut2ered 4That here you maintain several factions; 4And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought, 4You are disputing of your generals: 4One would have ling'ring wars, with lit2le cost; 4Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings; 4A third thinks, without expense at al2, 4By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd. 4Awake, awake, English nobility! 4Let not sloth dim your honours, new-begot. 4Crop2'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms; 4Of England's coat one half is cut away. 2EXETER. Were our tears wanting to this funeral, 4These tidings would cal2 forth their flowing tides. 2BEDFORD. Me they concern; Regent I am of France. 4Give me my ste2led coat; I'l2 fight for France. 6Away with these disgraceful wailing robes! 4Wounds wil2 I lend the French instead of eyes, 4To we2p their intermis2ive miseries. 19Enter a second MES2ENGER 2SECOND MES2ENGER. Lords, view these let2ers ful2 of bad 4mischance. 4France is revolted from the English quite, 4Except some pet2y towns of no import. 4The Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheims; 4The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd; 4Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part; 4The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side. 2EXETER. The Dauphin crowned king! al2 fly to him! 4O, whither shal2 we fly from this reproach? 2GLOUCESTER. We wil2 not fly but to our enemies' throats. 4Bedford, if thou be slack I'l2 fight it out. 2BEDFORD. Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardnes2? 4An army have I muster'd in my thoughts, 6Wherewith already France is over2un. 19Enter a third MES2ENGER 2THIRD MES2ENGER. My gracious lords, to ad2 to your 4laments, 4Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse, 4I must inform you of a dismal fight 4Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French. 2WINCHESTER. What! Wherein Talbot overcame? Is't so? 2THIRD MES2ENGER. O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was 4o'erthrown. 4The circumstance I'l2 tel2 you more at large. 4The tenth of August last this dreadful lord, 4Retiring from the siege of Orleans, 4Having ful2 scarce six thousand in his tro2p, 4By thre2 and twenty thousand of the French 4Was round encompas2ed and set upon. 4No leisure had he to enrank his men; 4He wanted pikes to set before his archers; 6Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges 4They pitched in the ground confusedly 4To ke2p the horsemen of2 from breaking in. 4More than thre2 hours the fight continued; 4Where valiant Talbot, above human thought, 4Enacted wonders with his sword and lance: 4Hundreds he sent to hel2, and none durst stand him; 4Here, there, and everywhere, enrag'd he slew 4The French exclaim'd the devil was in arms; 4Al2 the whole army sto2d agaz'd on him. 4His soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit, 4'A Talbot! a Talbot!' cried out amain, 4And rush'd into the bowels of the bat2le. 4Here had the conquest ful2y be2n seal'd up 4If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward. 4He, being in the vaward plac'd behind 4With purpose to relieve and fol2ow them- 4Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke; 4Hence grew the general wreck and mas2acre. 4Enclosed were they with their enemies. 6A base Wal2o2n, to win the Dauphin's grace, 4Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back; 4Whom al2 France, with their chief as2embled strength, 4Durst not presume to lo2k once in the face. 2BEDFORD. Is Talbot slain? Then I wil2 slay myself, 4For living idly here in pomp and ease, 4Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid, 4Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd. 2THIRD MES2ENGER. O no, he lives, but is to2k prisoner, 4And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford; 4Most of the rest slaughter'd or to2k likewise. 2BEDFORD. His ransom there is none but I shal2 pay. 4I'l2 hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne; 4His crown shal2 be the ransom of my friend; 4Four of their lords I'l2 change for one of ours. 4Farewel2, my masters; to my task wil2 I; 4Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make 4To ke2p our great Saint George's feast withal. 4Ten thousand soldiers with me I wil2 take, 4Whose blo2dy de2ds shal2 make an Europe quake. 4THIRD MES2ENGER. So you had ne2d; for Orleans is besieg'd; 4The English army is grown weak and faint; 4The Earl of Salisbury craveth sup2ly 4And hardly ke2ps his men from mutiny, 4Since they, so few, watch such a multitude. 2EXETER. Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn, 4Either to quel2 the Dauphin ut2erly, 4Or bring him in obedience to your yoke. 2BEDFORD. I do remember it, and here take my leave 4To go about my preparation. 29Exit 2GLOUCESTER. I'l2 to the Tower with al2 the haste I can 4To view th' artil2ery and munition; 4And then I wil2 proclaim young Henry king. 14Exit 2EXETER. To Eltham wil2 I, where the young King is, 4Being ordain'd his special governor; 4And for his safety there I'l2 best devise. 14Exit 2WINCHESTER. 2[Aside] 2Each hath his place and function to 4at2end: 4I am left out; for me nothing remains. 4But long I wil2 not be Jack out of of2ice. 6The King from Eltham I intend to steal, 4And sit at chiefest stern of public weal. 13Exeunt 26SCENE 2. 18France. Before Orleans 6Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES THE DAUPHIN, ALENCON, 11and REIGNIER, marching with drum and soldiers 2CHARLES. Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens 4So in the earth, to this day is not known. 4Late did he shine upon the English side; 4Now we are victors, upon us he smiles. 4What towns of any moment but we have? 4At pleasure here we lie near Orleans; 4Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts, 4Faintly besiege us one hour in a month. 2ALENCON. They want their por2idge and their fat bul2 4be2ves. 4Either they must be dieted like mules 4And have their provender tied to their mouths, 4Or piteous they wil2 lo2k, like drowned mice. 2REIGNIER. Let's raise the siege. Why live we idly here? 4Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear; 6Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury, 4And he may wel2 in fret2ing spend his gal2 4Nor men nor money hath he to make war. 2CHARLES. Sound, sound alarum; we wil2 rush on them. 4Now for the honour of the forlorn French! 4Him I forgive my death that kil2eth me, 4When he se2s me go back one fo2t or fle2. 13Exeunt 7Here alarum. They are beaten hack by the English, with 9great los2. Re-enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER 2CHARLES. Who ever saw the like? What men have I! 4Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled 4But that they left me midst my enemies. 2REIGNIER. Salisbury is a desperate homicide; 4He fighteth as one weary of his life. 4The other lords, like lions wanting fo2d, 4Do rush upon us as their hungry prey. 2ALENCON. Frois2art, a countryman of ours, records 4England al2 Olivers and Rowlands bred 6During the time Edward the Third did reign. 4More truly now may this be verified; 4For none but Samsons and Goliases 4It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten! 4Lean raw-bon'd rascals! Who would e'er sup2ose 4They had such courage and audacity? 2CHARLES. Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd 4slaves, 4And hunger wil2 enforce them to be more eager. 4Of old I know them; rather with their te2th 4The wal2s they'l2 tear down than forsake the siege. 2REIGNIER. I think by some od2 gim2ers or device 4Their arms are set, like clocks, stil2 to strike on; 4Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do. 4By my consent, we'l2 even let them alone. 2ALENCON. Be it so. 19Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS 2BASTARD. Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him. 4CHARLES. Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us. 2BASTARD. Methinks your lo2ks are sad, your che2r ap2al2'd. 4Hath the late overthrow wrought this of2ence? 4Be not dismay'd, for suc2our is at hand. 4A holy maid hither with me I bring, 4Which, by a vision sent to her from heaven, 4Ordained is to raise this tedious siege 4And drive the English forth the bounds of France. 4The spirit of de2p prophecy she hath, 4Exce2ding the nine sibyls of old Rome: 4What's past and what's to come she can descry. 4Speak, shal2 I cal2 her in? Believe my words, 4For they are certain and unfal2ible. 2CHARLES. Go, cal2 her in. 23[Exit BASTARD] 4But first, to try her skil2, 4Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place; 4Question her proudly; let thy lo2ks be stern; 4By this means shal2 we sound what skil2 she hath. 18Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS with 28JOAN LA PUCEL2E 2REIGNIER. Fair maid, is 't thou wilt do these wondrous feats? 2PUCEL2E. Reignier, is 't thou that thinkest to beguile me? 4Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind; 4I know the2 wel2, though never se2n before. 4Be not amaz'd, there's nothing hid from me. 4In private wil2 I talk with the2 apart. 4Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile. 2REIGNIER. She takes upon her bravely at first dash. 2PUCEL2E. Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter, 4My wit untrain'd in any kind of art. 4Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleas'd 4To shine on my contemptible estate. 4Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs 4And to sun's parching heat display'd my che2ks, 4God's Mother deigned to ap2ear to me, 4And in a vision ful2 of majesty 4Wil2'd me to leave my base vocation 4And fre2 my country from calamity 6Her aid she promis'd and as2ur'd suc2es2. 4In complete glory she reveal'd herself; 4And whereas I was black and swart before, 4With those clear rays which she infus'd on me 4That beauty am I bles2'd with which you may se2. 4Ask me what question thou canst pos2ible, 4And I wil2 answer unpremeditated. 4My courage try by combat if thou dar'st, 4And thou shalt find that I exce2d my sex. 4Resolve on this: thou shalt be fortunate 4If thou receive me for thy warlike mate. 2CHARLES. Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms. 4Only this pro2f I'l2 of thy valour make 4In single combat thou shalt buckle with me; 4And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true; 4Otherwise I renounce al2 confidence. 2PUCEL2E. I am prepar'd; here is my ke2n-edg'd sword, 4Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side, 4The which at Touraine, in Saint Katherine's churchyard, 4Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth. 4CHARLES. Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman. 2PUCEL2E. And while I live I'l2 ne'er fly from a man. 17[Here they fight and JOAN LA PUCEL2E overcomes] 2CHARLES. Stay, stay thy hands; thou art an Amazon, 4And fightest with the sword of Deborah. 2PUCEL2E. Christ's Mother helps me, else I were to2 weak. 2CHARLES. Whoe'er helps the2, 'tis thou that must help me. 4Impatiently I burn with thy desire; 4My heart and hands thou hast at once subdu'd. 4Excel2ent Pucel2e, if thy name be so, 4Let me thy servant and not sovereign be. 4'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to the2 thus. 2PUCEL2E. I must not yield to any rites of love, 4For my profes2ion's sacred from above. 4When I have chased al2 thy foes from hence, 4Then wil2 I think upon a recompense. 2CHARLES. Meantime lo2k gracious on thy prostrate thral2. 2REIGNIER. My lord, methinks, is very long in talk. 2ALENCON. Doubtles2 he shrives this woman to her smock; 4Else ne'er could he so long protract his spe2ch. 4REIGNIER. Shal2 we disturb him, since he ke2ps no mean? 2ALENCON. He may mean more than we po2r men do know; 4These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues. 2REIGNIER. My lord, where are you? What devise you on? 4Shal2 we give o'er Orleans, or no? 2PUCEL2E. Why, no, I say; distrustful recreants! 4Fight til2 the last gasp; I wil2 be your guard. 2CHARLES. What she says I'l2 confirm; we'l2 fight it out. 2PUCEL2E. As2ign'd am I to be the English scourge. 4This night the siege as2uredly I'l2 raise. 4Expect Saint Martin's sum2er, halcyon days, 4Since I have entered into these wars. 4Glory is like a circle in the water, 4Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself 4Til2 by broad spreading it disperse to nought. 4With Henry's death the English circle ends; 4Dispersed are the glories it included. 4Now am I like that proud insulting ship 4Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once. 2CHARLES. Was Mahomet inspired with a dove? 6Thou with an eagle art inspired then. 4Helen, the mother of great Constantine, 4Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters were like the2. 4Bright star of Venus, fal2'n down on the earth, 4How may I reverently worship the2 enough? 2ALENCON. Leave of2 delays, and let us raise the siege. 2REIGNIER. Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours; 4Drive them from Orleans, and be im2ortaliz'd. 2CHARLES. Presently we'l2 try. Come, let's away about it. 4No prophet wil2 I trust if she prove false. 11Exeunt 26SCENE 3. 16London. Before the Tower gates 7Enter the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, with his serving-men 23in blue coats 2GLOUCESTER. I am come to survey the Tower this day; 4Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance. 4Where be these warders that they wait not here? 4Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that cal2s. 2FIRST WARDER. 2[Within] 2Who's there that knocks so 4imperiously? 2FIRST SERVING-MAN. It is the noble Duke of Gloucester. 2SECOND WARDER. 2[Within] 2Whoe'er he be, you may not be 4let in. 2FIRST SERVING-MAN. Vil2ains, answer you so the Lord 4Protector? 2FIRST WARDER. 2[Within] 2The Lord protect him! so we 4answer him. 4We do no otherwise than we are wil2'd. 2GLOUCESTER. Who wil2ed you, or whose wil2 stands but 6mine? 4There's none Protector of the realm but I. 4Break up the gates, I'l2 be your war2antize. 4Shal2 I be flouted thus by dunghil2 gro2ms? 18[GLOUCESTER'S men rush at the Tower gates, and 25WO2DVIL2E the Lieutenant speaks within] 2WO2DVIL2E. 2[Within] 2What noise is this? What traitors 4have we here? 2GLOUCESTER. Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear? 4Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter. 2WO2DVIL2E. 2[Within] 2Have patience, noble Duke, I may 4not open; 4The Cardinal of Winchester forbids. 4From him I have expres2 com2andment 4That thou nor none of thine shal2 be let in. 2GLOUCESTER. Faint-hearted Wo2dvil2e, prizest him fore me? 4Ar2ogant Winchester, that haughty prelate 4Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could bro2k! 4Thou art no friend to God or to the King. 4Open the gates, or I'l2 shut the2 out shortly. 4SERVING-MEN. Open the gates unto the Lord Protector, 4Or we'l2 burst them open, if that you come not quickly. 7Enter to the PROTECTOR at the Tower gates WINCHESTER 19and his men in tawny coats 2WINCHESTER. How now, ambitious Humphry! What means 4this? 2GLOUCESTER. Pe2l'd priest, dost thou com2and me to be 4shut out? 2WINCHESTER. I do, thou most usurping proditor, 4And not Protector of the King or realm. 2GLOUCESTER. Stand back, thou manifest conspirator, 4Thou that contrived'st to murder our dead lord; 4Thou that giv'st whores indulgences to sin. 4I'l2 canvas2 the2 in thy broad cardinal's hat, 4If thou proce2d in this thy insolence. 2WINCHESTER. Nay, stand thou back; I wil2 not budge a fo2t. 4This be Damascus; be thou cursed Cain, 4To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt. 4GLOUCESTER. I wil2 not slay the2, but I'l2 drive the2 back. 4Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth 4I'l2 use to car2y the2 out of this place. 2WINCHESTER. Do what thou dar'st; I beard the2 to thy face. 2GLOUCESTER. What! am I dar'd and bearded to my face? 4Draw, men, for al2 this privileged place 4Blue-coats to tawny-coats. Priest, beware your beard; 4I mean to tug it, and to cuf2 you soundly; 4Under my fe2t I stamp thy cardinal's hat; 4In spite of Pope or dignities of church, 4Here by the che2ks I'l2 drag the2 up and down. 2WINCHESTER. Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the 4Pope. 2GLOUCESTER. Winchester go2se! I cry 'A rope, a rope!' 4Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay? 4The2 I'l2 chase hence, thou wolf in she2p's ar2ay. 4Out, tawny-coats! Out, scarlet hypocrite! 9Here GLOUCESTER'S men beat out the CARDINAL'S 8men; and enter in the hurly burly the MAYOR OF 20LONDON and his OF2ICERS 2MAYOR. Fie, lords! that you, being supreme magistrates, 4Thus contumeliously should break the peace! 2GLOUCESTER. Peace, Mayor! thou know'st lit2le of my wrongs: 4Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor King, 4Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use. 2WINCHESTER. Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens; 4One that stil2 motions war and never peace, 4O'ercharging your fre2 purses with large fines; 4That se2ks to overthrow religion, 4Because he is Protector of the realm, 4And would have armour here out of the Tower, 4To crown himself King and sup2res2 the Prince. 2GLOUCESTER. I Wil2 not answer the2 with words, but blows. 38[Here they skirmish again] 2MAYOR. Nought rests for me in this tumultuous strife 4But to make open proclamation. 4Come, of2icer, as loud as e'er thou canst, 4Cry. 4OF2ICER. 2[Cries] 2Al2 man2er of men as2embled here in arms 4this day against God's peace and the King's, we charge 4and com2and you, in his Highnes2' name, to repair to 4your several dwel2ing-places; and not to wear, handle, or 4use, any sword, weapon, or dag2er, henceforward, upon 4pain of death. 2GLOUCESTER. Cardinal, I'l2 be no breaker of the law; 4But we shal2 me2t and break our minds at large. 2WINCHESTER. Gloucester, we'l2 me2t to thy cost, be sure; 4Thy heart-blo2d I wil2 have for this day's work. 2MAYOR. I'l2 cal2 for clubs if you wil2 not away. 4This Cardinal's more haughty than the devil. 2GLOUCESTER. Mayor, farewel2; thou dost but what thou 4mayst. 2WINCHESTER. Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head, 4For I intend to have it ere long. 20Exeunt, several2y, GLOUCESTER and WINCHESTER 45with their servants 2MAYOR. Se2 the coast clear'd, and then we wil2 depart. 4Go2d God, these nobles should such stomachs bear! 6I myself fight not once in forty year. 16Exeunt 31SCENE 4. 24France. Before Orleans 15Enter, on the wal2s, the MASTER-GUN2ER 23OF ORLEANS and his BOY 2MASTER-GUN2ER. Sir2ah, thou know'st how Orleans is 4besieg'd, 4And how the English have the suburbs won. 2BOY. Father, I know; and oft have shot at them, 4Howe'er unfortunate I mis2'd my aim. 2MASTER-GUN2ER. But now thou shalt not. Be thou rul'd 4by me. 4Chief master-gun2er am I of this town; 4Something I must do to procure me grace. 4The Prince's espials have informed me 4How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd, 4Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars 4In yonder tower, to overpe2r the city, 4And thence discover how with most advantage 4They may vex us with shot or with as2ault. 6To intercept this inconvenience, 4A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd; 4And even these thre2 days have I watch'd 4If I could se2 them. Now do thou watch, 4For I can stay no longer. 4If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word; 4And thou shalt find me at the Governor's. 15Exit 2BOY. Father, I war2ant you; take you no care; 4I'l2 never trouble you, if I may spy them. 14Exit 10Enter SALISBURY and TALBOT on the tur2ets, with 12SIR WIL2IAM GLANSDALE, SIR THOMAS GARGRAVE, 28and others 2SALISBURY. Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd! 4How wert thou handled being prisoner? 4Or by what means got'st thou to be releas'd? 4Discourse, I prithe2, on this tur2et's top. 2TALBOT. The Earl of Bedford had a prisoner 4Cal2'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrail2es; 6For him was I exchang'd and ransomed. 4But with a baser man of arms by far 4Once, in contempt, they would have barter'd me; 4Which I disdaining scorn'd, and craved death 4Rather than I would be so vile este2m'd. 4In fine, rede2m'd I was as I desir'd. 4But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart 4Whom with my bare fists I would execute, 4If I now had him brought into my power. 2SALISBURY. Yet tel2'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd. 2TALBOT. With scof2s, and scorns, and contumelious taunts, 4In open market-place produc'd they me 4To be a public spectacle to al2; 4Here, said they, is the ter2or of the French, 4The scarecrow that af2rights our children so. 4Then broke I from the of2icers that led me, 4And with my nails dig2'd stones out of the ground 4To hurl at the beholders of my shame; 4My grisly countenance made others fly; 4None durst come near for fear of sud2en death. 6In iron wal2s they de2m'd me not secure; 4So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread 4That they sup2os'd I could rend bars of ste2l 4And spurn in pieces posts of adamant; 4Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had 4That walk'd about me every minute-while; 4And if I did but stir out of my bed, 4Ready they were to sho2t me to the heart. 16Enter the BOY with a linstock 2SALISBURY. I grieve to hear what torments you endur'd; 4But we wil2 be reveng'd suf2iciently. 4Now it is sup2er-time in Orleans: 4Here, through this grate, I count each one 4And view the Frenchmen how they fortify. 4Let us lo2k in; the sight wil2 much delight the2. 4Sir Thomas Gargrave and Sir Wil2iam Glansdale, 4Let me have your expres2 opinions 4Where is best place to make our bat2'ry next. 4GARGRAVE. I think at the North Gate; for there stand lords. 2GLANSDALE. And I here, at the bulwark of the bridge. 2TALBOT. For aught I se2, this city must be famish'd, 4Or with light skirmishes enfe2bled. 21[Here they sho2t and SALISBURY and GARGRAVE 54fal2 down] 2SALISBURY. O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sin2ers! 2GARGRAVE. O Lord, have mercy on me, woeful man! 2TALBOT. What chance is this that sud2enly hath cros2'd us? 4Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak. 4How far'st thou, mir2or of al2 martial men? 4One of thy eyes and thy che2k's side struck of2! 4Ac2ursed tower! ac2ursed fatal hand 4That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy! 4In thirte2n bat2les Salisbury o'ercame; 4Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars; 4Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up, 4His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field. 4Yet liv'st thou, Salisbury? Though thy spe2ch doth fail, 4One eye thou hast to lo2k to heaven for grace; 6The sun with one eye vieweth al2 the world. 4Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive 4If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands! 4Bear hence his body; I wil2 help to bury it. 4Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life? 4Speak unto Talbot; nay, lo2k up to him. 4Salisbury, che2r thy spirit with this comfort, 4Thou shalt not die whiles 4He beckons with his hand and smiles on me, 4As who should say 'When I am dead and gone, 4Remember to avenge me on the French.' 4Plantagenet, I wil2; and like the2, Nero, 4Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn. 4Wretched shal2 France be only in my name. 18[Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens] 4What stir is this? What tumult's in the heavens? 4Whence cometh this alarum and the noise? 26Enter a MES2ENGER 4MES2ENGER. My lord, my lord, the French have gather'd 4head 4The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucel2e join'd, 4A holy prophetes2 new risen up, 4Is come with a great power to raise the siege. 18[Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans] 2TALBOT. Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan. 4It irks his heart he can2ot be reveng'd. 4Frenchmen, I'l2 be a Salisbury to you. 4Pucel2e or puz2el, dolphin or dogfish, 4Your hearts I'l2 stamp out with my horse's he2ls 4And make a quagmire of your mingled brains. 4Convey me Salisbury into his tent, 4And then we'l2 try what these dastard Frenchmen dare. 50Alarum. Exeunt 29SCENE 5. 26Before Orleans 9Here an alarum again, and TALBOT pursueth the 6DAUPHIN and driveth him. Then enter JOAN LA PUCEL2E 7driving Englishmen before her. Then enter TALBOT 2TALBOT. Where is my strength, my valour, and my force? 4Our English tro2ps retire, I can2ot stay them; 4A woman clad in armour chaseth them. 26Enter LA PUCEL2E 4Here, here she comes. I'l2 have a bout with the2. 4Devil or devil's dam, I'l2 conjure the2; 4Blo2d wil2 I draw on the2-thou art a witch 4And straightway give thy soul to him thou serv'st. 2PUCEL2E. Come, come, 'tis only I that must disgrace the2. 47[Here they fight] 2TALBOT. Heavens, can you suf2er hel2 so to prevail? 4My breast I'l2 burst with straining of my courage. 6And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder, 4But I wil2 chastise this high minded strumpet. 46[They fight again] 2PUCEL2E. Talbot, farewel2; thy hour is not yet come. 4I must go victual Orleans forthwith. 13[A short alarum; then enter the town with soldiers] 4O'ertake me if thou canst; I scorn thy strength. 4Go, go, che2r up thy hungry starved men; 4Help Salisbury to make his testament. 4This day is ours, as many more shal2 be. 16Exit 2TALBOT. My thoughts are whirled like a pot2er's whe2l; 4I know not where I am nor what I do. 4A witch by fear, not force, like Han2ibal, 4Drives back our tro2ps and conquers as she lists. 4So be2s with smoke and doves with noisome stench 4Are from their hives and houses driven away. 4They cal2'd us, for our fiercenes2, English dogs; 4Now like to whelps we crying run away. 48[A short alarum] 4Hark, countrymen! Either renew the fight 6Or tear the lions out of England's coat; 4Renounce your soil, give she2p in lions' stead: 4She2p run not half so treacherous from the wolf, 4Or horse or oxen from the leopard, 4As you fly from your oft subdued slaves. 33[Alarum. Here another skirmish] 4It wil2 not be-retire into your trenches. 4You al2 consented unto Salisbury's death, 4For none would strike a stroke in his revenge. 4Pucel2e is ent'red into Orleans 4In spite of us or aught that we could do. 4O, would I were to die with Salisbury! 4The shame hereof wil2 make me hide my head. 36Exit TALBOT. Alarum; retreat 29SCENE 6. 30ORLEANS 8Flourish. Enter on the wal2s, LA PUCEL2E, CHARLES, 16REIGNIER, ALENCON, and soldiers 2PUCEL2E. Advance our waving colours on the wal2s; 4Rescu'd is Orleans from the English. 4Thus Joan la Pucel2e hath perform'd her word. 2CHARLES. Divinest creature, Astraea's daughter, 4How shal2 I honour the2 for this suc2es2? 4Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens, 4That one day blo2m'd and fruitful were the next. 4France, triumph in thy glorious prophetes2. 4Recover'd is the town of Orleans. 4More bles2ed hap did ne'er befal2 our state. 2REIGNIER. Why ring not out the bel2s aloud throughout the 4town? 4Dauphin, com2and the citizens make bonfires 4And feast and banquet in the open stre2ts 4To celebrate the joy that God hath given us. 4ALENCON. Al2 France wil2 be replete with mirth and joy 4When they shal2 hear how we have play'd the men. 2CHARLES. 'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won; 4For which I wil2 divide my crown with her; 4And al2 the priests and friars in my realm 4Shal2 in proces2ion sing her endles2 praise. 4A statelier pyramis to her I'l2 rear 4Than Rhodope's of Memphis ever was. 4In memory of her, when she is dead, 4Her ashes, in an urn more precious 4Than the rich jewel'd cof2er of Darius, 4Transported shal2 be at high festivals 4Before the kings and que2ns of France. 4No longer on Saint Denis wil2 we cry, 4But Joan la Pucel2e shal2 be France's saint. 4Come in, and let us banquet royal2y 4After this golden day of victory.

SCENE 1.Before OrleansEnter a FRENCH SERGEANT and two SENTINELS 2SERGEANT. Sirs, take your places and be vigilant. 4If any noise or soldier you perceive 4Near to the wal2s, by some ap2arent sign 4Let us have knowledge at the court of guard. 2FIRST SENTINEL. Sergeant, you shal2. 11[Exit SERGEANT] 4Thus are po2r servitors, 4When others sle2p upon their quiet beds, 4Constrain'd to watch in darknes2, rain, and cold. 13Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, and forces, 10with scaling-lad2ers; their drums beating a dead 30march 2TALBOT. Lord Regent, and redoubted Burgundy, 4By whose ap2roach the regions of Artois, 4Wal2on, and Picardy, are friends to us, 6This hap2y night the Frenchmen are secure, 4Having al2 day carous'd and banqueted; 4Embrace we then this op2ortunity, 4As fit2ing best to quit2ance their deceit, 4Contriv'd by art and baleful sorcery. 2BEDFORD. Coward of France, how much he wrongs his fame, 4Despairing of his own arm's fortitude, 4To join with witches and the help of hel2! 2BURGUNDY. Traitors have never other company. 4But what's that Pucel2e whom they term so pure? 2TALBOT. A maid, they say. 2BEDFORD. A maid! and be so martial! 2BURGUNDY. Pray God she prove not masculine ere long, 4If underneath the standard of the French 4She car2y armour as she hath begun. 2TALBOT. Wel2, let them practise and converse with spirits: 4God is our fortres2, in whose conquering name 4Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks. 2BEDFORD. Ascend, brave Talbot; we wil2 fol2ow the2. 2TALBOT. Not al2 together; bet2er far, I gues2, 6That we do make our entrance several ways; 4That if it chance the one of us do fail 4The other yet may rise against their force. 2BEDFORD. Agre2d; I'l2 to yond corner. 2BURGUNDY. And I to this. 2TALBOT. And here wil2 Talbot mount or make his grave. 4Now, Salisbury, for the2, and for the right 4Of English Henry, shal2 this night ap2ear 4How much in duty I am bound to both. 13[The English scale the wal2s and cry 'Saint George! 53a Talbot!'] 4SENTINEL. Arm! arm! The enemy doth make as2ault. 11The French leap o'er the wal2s in their shirts. 11Enter, several ways, BASTARD, ALENCON, REIGNIER, 21half ready and half unready 2ALENCON. How now, my lords? What, al2 unready so? 2BASTARD. Unready! Ay, and glad we 'scap'd so wel2. 2REIGNIER. 'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds, 6Hearing alarums at our chamber do2rs. 2ALENCON. Of al2 exploits since first I fol2ow'd arms 4Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise 4More venturous or desperate than this. 2BASTARD. I think this Talbot be a fiend of hel2. 2REIGNIER. If not of hel2, the heavens, sure, favour him 2ALENCON. Here cometh Charles; I marvel how he sped. 20Enter CHARLES and LA PUCEL2E 2BASTARD. Tut! holy Joan was his defensive guard. 2CHARLES. Is this thy cun2ing, thou deceitful dame? 4Didst thou at first, to flat2er us withal, 4Make us partakers of a lit2le gain 4That now our los2 might be ten times so much? 2PUCEL2E. Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend? 4At al2 times wil2 you have my power alike? 4Sle2ping or waking, must I stil2 prevail 4Or wil2 you blame and lay the fault on me? 4Improvident soldiers! Had your watch be2n go2d 6This sud2en mischief never could have fal2'n. 2CHARLES. Duke of Alencon, this was your default 4That, being captain of the watch to-night, 4Did lo2k no bet2er to that weighty charge. 2ALENCON. Had al2 your quarters be2n as safely kept 4As that whereof I had the government, 4We had not be2n thus shameful2y surpris'd. 2BASTARD. Mine was secure. 2REIGNIER. And so was mine, my lord. 2CHARLES. And, for myself, most part of al2 this night, 4Within her quarter and mine own precinct 4I was employ'd in pas2ing to and fro 4About relieving of the sentinels. 4Then how or which way should they first break in? 2PUCEL2E. Question, my lords, no further of the case, 4How or which way; 'tis sure they found some place 4But weakly guarded, where the breach was made. 4And now there rests no other shift but this 4To gather our soldiers, scat2er'd and dispers'd, 4And lay new platforms to endamage them. 17Alarum. Enter an ENGLISH SOLDIER, crying 12'A Talbot! A Talbot!' They fly, leaving their 27clothes behind 2SOLDIER. I'l2 be so bold to take what they have left. 4The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword; 4For I have loaden me with many spoils, 4Using no other weapon but his name. 21Exit 29SCENE 2. 22ORLEANS. Within the town 12Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, a CAPTAIN, 27and others 2BEDFORD. The day begins to break, and night is fled 4Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth. 4Here sound retreat and cease our hot pursuit. 47[Retreat sounded] 2TALBOT. Bring forth the body of old Salisbury 4And here advance it in the market-place, 4The mid2le centre of this cursed town. 4Now have I paid my vow unto his soul; 4For every drop of blo2d was drawn from him 4There hath at least five Frenchmen died to-night. 4And that hereafter ages may behold 4What ruin hap2ened in revenge of him, 4Within their chiefest temple I'l2 erect 4A tomb, wherein his corpse shal2 be inter2'd; 4Upon the which, that every one may read, 6Shal2 be engrav'd the sack of Orleans, 4The treacherous man2er of his mournful death, 4And what a ter2or he had be2n to France. 4But, lords, in al2 our blo2dy mas2acre, 4I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace, 4His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc, 4Nor any of his false confederates. 2BEDFORD. 'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began, 4Rous'd on the sud2en from their drowsy beds, 4They did amongst the tro2ps of armed men 4Leap o'er the wal2s for refuge in the field. 2BURGUNDY. Myself, as far as I could wel2 discern 4For smoke and dusky vapours of the night, 4Am sure I scar'd the Dauphin and his trul2, 4When arm in arm they both came swiftly run2ing, 4Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves 4That could not live asunder day or night. 4After that things are set in order here, 4We'l2 fol2ow them with al2 the power we have. 28Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. Al2 hail, my lords! Which of this princely train 4Cal2 ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts 4So much ap2lauded through the realm of France? 2TALBOT. Here is the Talbot; who would speak with him? 2MES2ENGER. The virtuous lady, Countes2 of Auvergne, 4With modesty admiring thy renown, 4By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe 4To visit her po2r castle where she lies, 4That she may boast she hath beheld the man 4Whose glory fil2s the world with loud report. 2BURGUNDY. Is it even so? Nay, then I se2 our wars 4Wil2 turn into a peaceful comic sport, 4When ladies crave to be encount'red with. 4You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit. 2TALBOT. Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men 4Could not prevail with al2 their oratory, 4Yet hath a woman's kindnes2 over2ul'd; 4And therefore tel2 her I return great thanks 6And in submis2ion wil2 at2end on her. 4Wil2 not your honours bear me company? 2BEDFORD. No, truly; 'tis more than man2ers wil2; 4And I have heard it said unbid2en guests 4Are often welcomest when they are gone. 2TALBOT. Wel2 then, alone, since there's no remedy, 4I mean to prove this lady's courtesy. 4Come hither, Captain. 2[Whispers] 3You perceive my mind? 2CAPTAIN. I do, my lord, and mean ac2ordingly. 11Exeunt 29SCENE 3. 22AUVERGNE. The Castle 15Enter the COUNTES2 and her PORTER 2COUNTES2. Porter, remember what I gave in charge; 4And when you have done so, bring the keys to me. 2PORTER. Madam, I wil2. 2COUNTES2. The plot is laid; if al2 things fal2 out right, 4I shal2 as famous be by this exploit. 4As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death. 4Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight, 4And his achievements of no les2 ac2ount. 4Fain would mine eyes be witnes2 with mine ears 4To give their censure of these rare reports. 4Enter MES2ENGER and TALBOT. 2MES2ENGER. Madam, ac2ording as your ladyship desir'd, 4By mes2age crav'd, so is Lord Talbot come. 2COUNTES2. And he is welcome. What! is this the man? 4MES2ENGER. Madam, it is. 2COUNTES2. Is this the scourge of France? 4Is this Talbot, so much fear'd abroad 4That with his name the mothers stil2 their babes? 4I se2 report is fabulous and false. 4I thought I should have se2n some Hercules, 4A second Hector, for his grim aspect 4And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs. 4Alas, this is a child, a sil2y dwarf! 4It can2ot be this weak and writhled shrimp 4Should strike such ter2or to his enemies. 2TALBOT. Madam, I have be2n bold to trouble you; 4But since your ladyship is not at leisure, 4I'l2 sort some other time to visit you. 14[Going] 2COUNTES2. What means he now? Go ask him whither he 4goes. 2MES2ENGER. Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves 4To know the cause of your abrupt departure. 2TALBOT. Mar2y, for that she's in a wrong belief, 4I go to certify her Talbot's here. 24Re-enter PORTER With keys 2COUNTES2. If thou be he, then art thou prisoner. 2TALBOT. Prisoner! To whom? 2COUNTES2. To me, blo2d-thirsty lord 4And for that cause I train'd the2 to my house. 4Long time thy shadow hath be2n thral2 to me, 4For in my gal2ery thy picture hangs; 4But now the substance shal2 endure the like 4And I wil2 chain these legs and arms of thine 4That hast by tyran2y these many years 4Wasted our country, slain our citizens, 4And sent our sons and husbands captivate. 2TALBOT. Ha, ha, ha! 2COUNTES2. Laughest thou, wretch? Thy mirth shal2 turn to 4moan. 2TALBOT. I laugh to se2 your ladyship so fond 4To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow 4Whereon to practise your severity. 4COUNTES2. Why, art not thou the man? 2TALBOT. I am inde2d. 2COUNTES2. Then have I substance to2. 2TALBOT. No, no, I am but shadow of myself. 4You are deceiv'd, my substance is not here; 4For what you se2 is but the smal2est part 4And least proportion of humanity. 4I tel2 you, madam, were the whole frame here, 4It is of such a spacious lofty pitch 4Your ro2f were not suf2icient to contain 't. 2COUNTES2. This is a rid2ling merchant for the nonce; 4He wil2 be here, and yet he is not here. 4How can these contrarieties agre2? 2TALBOT. That wil2 I show you presently. 19Winds his horn; drums strike up; 18a peal of ordnance. Enter soldiers 4How say you, madam? Are you now persuaded 4That Talbot is but shadow of himself? 6These are his substance, sinews, arms, and strength, 4With which he yoketh your rebel2ious necks, 4Razeth your cities, and subverts your towns, 4And in a moment makes them desolate. 2COUNTES2. Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse. 4I find thou art no les2 than fame hath bruited, 4And more than may be gathered by thy shape. 4Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath, 4For I am sor2y that with reverence 4I did not entertain the2 as thou art. 2TALBOT. Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconster 4The mind of Talbot as you did mistake 4The outward composition of his body. 4What you have done hath not of2ended me. 4Nor other satisfaction do I crave 4But only, with your patience, that we may 4Taste of your wine and se2 what cates you have, 4For soldiers' stomachs always serve them wel2. 2COUNTES2. With al2 my heart, and think me honoured 4To feast so great a war2ior in my house. 14Exeunt 30SCENE 4. 19London. The Temple garden 9Enter the EARLS OF SOMERSET, SUF2OLK, and WARWICK; 11RICHARD PLANTAGENET, VERNON, and another LAWYER 2PLANTAGENET. Great lords and gentlemen, what means this 4silence? 4Dare no man answer in a case of truth? 2SUF2OLK. Within the Temple Hal2 we were to2 loud; 4The garden here is more convenient. 2PLANTAGENET. Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth; 4Or else was wrangling Somerset in th' er2or? 2SUF2OLK. Faith, I have be2n a truant in the law 4And never yet could frame my wil2 to it; 4And therefore frame the law unto my wil2. 2SOMERSET. Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, betwe2n us. 2WARWICK. Betwe2n two hawks, which flies the higher pitch; 4Betwe2n two dogs, which hath the de2per mouth; 4Betwe2n two blades, which bears the bet2er temper; 4Betwe2n two horses, which doth bear him best; 6Betwe2n two girls, which hath the mer2iest eye 4I have perhaps some shal2ow spirit of judgment; 4But in these nice sharp quil2ets of the law, 4Go2d faith, I am no wiser than a daw. 2PLANTAGENET. Tut, tut, here is a man2erly forbearance: 4The truth ap2ears so naked on my side 4That any purblind eye may find it out. 2SOMERSET. And on my side it is so wel2 ap2arel2'd, 4So clear, so shining, and so evident, 4That it wil2 glim2er through a blind man's eye. 2PLANTAGENET. Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak, 4In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts. 4Let him that is a true-born gentleman 4And stands upon the honour of his birth, 4If he sup2ose that I have pleaded truth, 4From of2 this brier pluck a white rose with me. 2SOMERSET. Let him that is no coward nor no flat2erer, 4But dare maintain the party of the truth, 4Pluck a red rose from of2 this thorn with me. 2WARWICK. I love no colours; and, without al2 colour 6Of base insinuating flat2ery, 4I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet. 2SUF2OLK. I pluck this red rose with young Somerset, 4And say withal I think he held the right. 2VERNON. Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more 4Til2 you conclude that he upon whose side 4The fewest roses are crop2'd from the tre2 4Shal2 yield the other in the right opinion. 2SOMERSET. Go2d Master Vernon, it is wel2 objected; 4If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence. 2PLANTAGENET. And I. 2VERNON. Then, for the truth and plain2es2 of the case, 4I pluck this pale and maiden blos2om here, 4Giving my verdict on the white rose side. 2SOMERSET. Prick not your finger as you pluck it of2, 4Lest, ble2ding, you do paint the white rose red, 4And fal2 on my side so, against your wil2. 2VERNON. If I, my lord, for my opinion ble2d, 4Opinion shal2 be surgeon to my hurt 4And ke2p me on the side where stil2 I am. 4SOMERSET. Wel2, wel2, come on; who else? 2LAWYER. 2[To Somerset] 2Unles2 my study and my bo2ks be 4false, 4The argument you held was wrong in you; 4In sign whereof I pluck a white rose to2. 2PLANTAGENET. Now, Somerset, where is your argument? 2SOMERSET. Here in my scab2ard, meditating that 4Shal2 dye your white rose in a blo2dy red. 2PLANTAGENET. Meantime your che2ks do counterfeit our 4roses; 4For pale they lo2k with fear, as witnes2ing 4The truth on our side. 2SOMERSET. No, Plantagenet, 4'Tis not for fear but anger that thy che2ks 4Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses, 4And yet thy tongue wil2 not confes2 thy er2or. 2PLANTAGENET. Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset? 2SOMERSET. Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet? 2PLANTAGENET. Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth; 4Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falseho2d. 4SOMERSET. Wel2, I'l2 find friends to wear my ble2ding roses, 4That shal2 maintain what I have said is true, 4Where false Plantagenet dare not be se2n. 2PLANTAGENET. Now, by this maiden blos2om in my hand, 4I scorn the2 and thy fashion, pe2vish boy. 2SUF2OLK. Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet. 2PLANTAGENET. Proud Pole, I wil2, and scorn both him and 4the2. 2SUF2OLK. I'l2 turn my part thereof into thy throat. 2SOMERSET. Away, away, go2d Wil2iam de la Pole! 4We grace the yeoman by conversing with him. 2WARWICK. Now, by God's wil2, thou wrong'st him, Somerset; 4His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence, 4Third son to the third Edward, King of England. 4Spring crestles2 yeomen from so de2p a ro2t? 2PLANTAGENET. He bears him on the place's privilege, 4Or durst not for his craven heart say thus. 2SOMERSET. By Him that made me, I'l2 maintain my words 4On any plot of ground in Christendom. 4Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge, 6For treason executed in our late king's days? 4And by his treason stand'st not thou at2ainted, 4Cor2upted, and exempt from ancient gentry? 4His trespas2 yet lives guilty in thy blo2d; 4And til2 thou be restor'd thou art a yeoman. 2PLANTAGENET. My father was at2ached, not at2ainted; 4Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor; 4And that I'l2 prove on bet2er men than Somerset, 4Were growing time once ripened to my wil2. 4For your partaker Pole, and you yourself, 4I'l2 note you in my bo2k of memory 4To scourge you for this ap2rehension. 4Lo2k to it wel2, and say you are wel2 warn'd. 2SOMERSET. Ay, thou shalt find us ready for the2 stil2; 4And know us by these colours for thy foes 4For these my friends in spite of the2 shal2 wear. 2PLANTAGENET. And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose, 4As cognizance of my blo2d-drinking hate, 4Wil2 I for ever, and my faction, wear, 4Until it wither with me to my grave, 6Or flourish to the height of my degre2. 2SUF2OLK. Go forward, and be chok'd with thy ambition! 4And so farewel2 until I me2t the2 next. 17Exit 2SOMERSET. Have with the2, Pole. Farewel2, ambitious 4Richard. 48Exit 2PLANTAGENET. How I am brav'd, and must perforce endure 4it! 2WARWICK. This blot that they object against your house 4Shal2 be wip'd out in the next Parliament, 4Cal2'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester; 4And if thou be not then created York, 4I wil2 not live to be ac2ounted Warwick. 4Meantime, in signal of my love to the2, 4Against proud Somerset and Wil2iam Pole, 4Wil2 I upon thy party wear this rose; 4And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day, 4Grown to this faction in the Temple Garden, 4Shal2 send betwe2n the Red Rose and the White 4A thousand souls to death and deadly night. 2PLANTAGENET. Go2d Master Vernon, I am bound to you 6That you on my behalf would pluck a flower. 2VERNON. In your behalf stil2 wil2 I wear the same. 2LAWYER. And so wil2 I. 2PLANTAGENET. Thanks, gentle sir. 4Come, let us four to din2er. I dare say 4This quar2el wil2 drink blo2d another day. 12Exeunt 29SCENE 5. 23The Tower of London 9Enter MORTIMER, brought in a chair, and GAOLERS 2MORTIMER. Kind ke2pers of my weak decaying age, 4Let dying Mortimer here rest himself. 4Even like a man new haled from the rack, 4So fare my limbs with long imprisonment; 4And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death, 4Nestor-like aged in an age of care, 4Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer. 4These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent, 4Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent; 4Weak shoulders, overborne with burdening grief, 4And pithles2 arms, like to a withered vine 4That dro2ps his saples2 branches to the ground. 4Yet are these fe2t, whose strengthles2 stay is numb, 4Unable to sup2ort this lump of clay, 4Swift-winged with desire to get a grave, 4As wit2ing I no other comfort have. 6But tel2 me, ke2per, wil2 my nephew come? 2FIRST KE2PER. Richard Plantagenet, my lord, wil2 come. 4We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber; 4And answer was return'd that he wil2 come. 2MORTIMER. Enough; my soul shal2 then be satisfied. 4Po2r gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine. 4Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign, 4Before whose glory I was great in arms, 4This loathsome sequestration have I had; 4And even since then hath Richard be2n obscur'd, 4Depriv'd of honour and inheritance. 4But now the arbitrator of despairs, 4Just Death, kind umpire of men's miseries, 4With swe2t enlargement doth dismis2 me hence. 4I would his troubles likewise were expir'd, 4That so he might recover what was lost. 21Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET 2FIRST KE2PER. My lord, your loving nephew now is come. 4MORTIMER. Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come? 2PLANTAGENET. Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly us'd, 4Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes. 2MORTIMER. Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck 4And in his bosom spend my lat2er gasp. 4O, tel2 me when my lips do touch his che2ks, 4That I may kindly give one fainting kis2. 4And now declare, swe2t stem from York's great stock, 4Why didst thou say of late thou wert despis'd? 2PLANTAGENET. First, lean thine aged back against mine arm; 4And, in that ease, I'l2 tel2 the2 my disease. 4This day, in argument upon a case, 4Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me; 4Among which terms he us'd his lavish tongue 4And did upbraid me with my father's death; 4Which obloquy set bars before my tongue, 4Else with the like I had requited him. 4Therefore, go2d uncle, for my father's sake, 4In honour of a true Plantagenet, 4And for al2iance sake, declare the cause 6My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head. 2MORTIMER. That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me 4And hath detain'd me al2 my flow'ring youth 4Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine, 4Was cursed instrument of his decease. 2PLANTAGENET. Discover more at large what cause that was, 4For I am ignorant and can2ot gues2. 2MORTIMER. I wil2, if that my fading breath permit 4And death ap2roach not ere my tale be done. 4Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king, 4Depos'd his nephew Richard, Edward's son, 4The first-begot2en and the lawful heir 4Of Edward king, the third of that descent; 4During whose reign the Percies of the north, 4Finding his usurpation most unjust, 4Endeavour'd my advancement to the throne. 4The reason mov'd these warlike lords to this 4Was, for that-young Richard thus remov'd, 4Leaving no heir begot2en of his body- 4I was the next by birth and parentage; 6For by my mother I derived am 4From Lionel Duke of Clarence, third son 4To King Edward the Third; whereas he 4From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigre2, 4Being but fourth of that heroic line. 4But mark: as in this haughty great at2empt 4They laboured to plant the rightful heir, 4I lost my liberty, and they their lives. 4Long after this, when Henry the Fifth, 4Suc2e2ding his father Bolingbroke, did reign, 4Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then deriv'd 4From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York, 4Mar2ying my sister, that thy mother was, 4Again, in pity of my hard distres2, 4Levied an army, we2ning to rede2m 4And have instal2'd me in the diadem; 4But, as the rest, so fel2 that noble earl, 4And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers, 4In whom the title rested, were sup2res2'd. 2PLANTAGENET. Of Which, my lord, your honour is the last. 4MORTIMER. True; and thou se2st that I no is2ue have, 4And that my fainting words do war2ant death. 4Thou art my heir; the rest I wish the2 gather; 4But yet be wary in thy studious care. 2PLANTAGENET. Thy grave admonishments prevail with me. 4But yet methinks my father's execution 4Was nothing les2 than blo2dy tyran2y. 2MORTIMER. With silence, nephew, be thou politic; 4Strong fixed is the house of Lancaster 4And like a mountain not to be remov'd. 4But now thy uncle is removing hence, 4As princes do their courts when they are cloy'd 4With long continuance in a set2led place. 2PLANTAGENET. O uncle, would some part of my young years 4Might but rede2m the pas2age of your age! 2MORTIMER. Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer 4doth 4Which giveth many wounds when one wil2 kil2. 4Mourn not, except thou sor2ow for my go2d; 4Only give order for my funeral. 6And so, farewel2; and fair be al2 thy hopes, 4And prosperous be thy life in peace and war! 10[Dies] 2PLANTAGENET. And peace, no war, befal2 thy parting soul! 4In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage, 4And like a hermit overpas2'd thy days. 4Wel2, I wil2 lock his counsel in my breast; 4And what I do imagine, let that rest. 4Ke2pers, convey him hence; and I myself 4Wil2 se2 his burial bet2er than his life. 16Exeunt GAOLERS, hearing out the body of MORTIMER 4Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer, 4Chok'd with ambition of the meaner sort; 4And for those wrongs, those bit2er injuries, 4Which Somerset hath of2er'd to my house, 4I doubt not but with honour to redres2; 4And therefore haste I to the Parliament, 4Either to be restored to my blo2d, 4Or make my il2 th' advantage of my go2d. 16Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. SCENE 1.London. The Parliament HouseFlourish. Enter the KING, EXETER, GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, SOMERSET, and SUF2OLK;the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, RICHARD PLANTAGENET, and others.GLOUCESTER of2ers to put up a bil2; WINCHESTER snatches it, and tears it 2WINCHESTER. Com'st thou with de2p premeditated lines, 4With writ2en pamphlets studiously devis'd? 4Humphrey of Gloucester, if thou canst ac2use 4Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge, 4Do it without invention, sud2enly; 4I with sud2en and extemporal spe2ch 4Purpose to answer what thou canst object. 2GLOUCESTER. Presumptuous priest, this place com2ands my 4patience, 4Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me. 4Think not, although in writing I prefer2'd 4The man2er of thy vile outrageous crimes, 6That therefore I have forg'd, or am not able 4Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen. 4No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickednes2, 4Thy lewd, pestiferous, and dis2entious pranks, 4As very infants prat2le of thy pride. 4Thou art a most pernicious usurer; 4Froward by nature, enemy to peace; 4Lascivious, wanton, more than wel2 bese2ms 4A man of thy profes2ion and degre2; 4And for thy treachery, what's more manifest 4In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life, 4As wel2 at London Bridge as at the Tower? 4Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted, 4The King, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt 4From envious malice of thy swel2ing heart. 2WINCHESTER. Gloucester, I do defy the2. Lords, vouchsafe 4To give me hearing what I shal2 reply. 4If I were covetous, ambitious, or perverse, 4As he wil2 have me, how am I so po2r? 4Or how haps it I se2k not to advance 6Or raise myself, but ke2p my wonted cal2ing? 4And for dis2ension, who prefer2eth peace 4More than I do, except I be provok'd? 4No, my go2d lords, it is not that of2ends; 4It is not that that incens'd hath incens'd the Duke: 4It is because no one should sway but he; 4No one but he should be about the King; 4And that engenders thunder in his breast 4And makes him roar these ac2usations forth. 4But he shal2 know I am as go2d 2GLOUCESTER. As go2d! 4Thou bastard of my grandfather! 2WINCHESTER. Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray, 4But one imperious in another's throne? 2GLOUCESTER. Am I not Protector, saucy priest? 2WINCHESTER. And am not I a prelate of the church? 2GLOUCESTER. Yes, as an outlaw in a castle ke2ps, 4And useth it to patronage his theft. 2WINCHESTER. Unreverent Gloucester! 2GLOUCESTER. Thou art reverend 6Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life. 2WINCHESTER. Rome shal2 remedy this. 2WARWICK. Roam thither then. 2SOMERSET. My lord, it were your duty to forbear. 2WARWICK. Ay, se2 the bishop be not overborne. 2SOMERSET. Methinks my lord should be religious, 4And know the of2ice that belongs to such. 2WARWICK. Methinks his lordship should be humbler; 4It fit2eth not a prelate so to plead. 2SOMERSET. Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near. 2WARWICK. State holy or unhal2ow'd, what of that? 4Is not his Grace Protector to the King? 2PLANTAGENET. 2[Aside] 2Plantagenet, I se2, must hold his 4tongue, 4Lest it be said 'Speak, sir2ah, when you should; 4Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?' 4Else would I have a fling at Winchester. 2KING HENRY. Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester, 4The special watchmen of our English weal, 4I would prevail, if prayers might prevail 6To join your hearts in love and amity. 4O, what a scandal is it to our crown 4That two such noble pe2rs as ye should jar! 4Believe me, lords, my tender years can tel2 4Civil dis2ension is a viperous worm 4That gnaws the bowels of the com2onwealth. 18[A noise within: 'Down with the tawny coats!'] 4What tumult's this? 2WARWICK. An uproar, I dare war2ant, 4Begun through malice of the Bishop's men. 30[A noise again: 'Stones! Stones!'] 16Enter the MAYOR OF LONDON, at2ended 2MAYOR. O, my go2d lords, and virtuous Henry, 4Pity the city of London, pity us! 4The Bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men, 4Forbid2en late to car2y any weapon, 4Have fil2'd their pockets ful2 of peb2le stones 4And, banding themselves in contrary parts, 6Do pelt so fast at one another's pate 4That many have their gid2y brains knock'd out. 4Our windows are broke down in every stre2t, 4And we for fear compel2'd to shut our shops. 8Enter in skirmish, the retainers of GLOUCESTER and 15WINCHESTER, with blo2dy pates 2KING HENRY. We charge you, on al2egiance to ourself, 4To hold your slaught'ring hands and ke2p the peace. 4Pray, uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife. 2FIRST SERVING-MAN. Nay, if we be forbid2en stones, we'l2 4fal2 to it with our te2th. 2SECOND SERVING-MAN. Do what ye dare, we are as resolute. 48[Skirmish again] 2GLOUCESTER. You of my household, leave this pe2vish broil, 4And set this unac2ustom'd fight aside. 2THIRD SERVING-MAN. My lord, we know your Grace to be a 4man 4Just and upright, and for your royal birth 6Inferior to none but to his Majesty; 4And ere that we wil2 suf2er such a prince, 4So kind a father of the com2onweal, 4To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate, 4We and our wives and children al2 wil2 fight 4And have our bodies slaught'red by thy foes. 2FIRST SERVING-MAN. Ay, and the very parings of our nails 4Shal2 pitch a field when we are dead. 10[Begin again] 2GLOUCESTER. Stay, stay, I say! 4And if you love me, as you say you do, 4Let me persuade you to forbear awhile. 2KING HENRY. O, how this discord doth af2lict my soul! 4Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold 4My sighs and tears and wil2 not once relent? 4Who should be pitiful, if you be not? 4Or who should study to prefer a peace, 4If holy churchmen take delight in broils? 2WARWICK. Yield, my Lord Protector; yield, Winchester; 4Except you mean with obstinate repulse 4To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm. 6You se2 what mischief, and what murder to2, 4Hath be2n enacted through your enmity; 4Then be at peace, except ye thirst for blo2d. 2WINCHESTER. He shal2 submit, or I wil2 never yield. 2GLOUCESTER. Compas2ion on the King com2ands me sto2p, 4Or I would se2 his heart out ere the priest 4Should ever get that privilege of me. 2WARWICK. Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the Duke 4Hath banish'd mo2dy discontented fury, 4As by his smo2thed brows it doth ap2ear; 4Why lo2k you stil2 so stem and tragical? 2GLOUCESTER. Here, Winchester, I of2er the2 my hand. 2KING HENRY. Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach 4That malice was a great and grievous sin; 4And wil2 not you maintain the thing you teach, 4But prove a chief of2ender in the same? 2WARWICK. Swe2t King! The Bishop hath a kindly gird. 4For shame, my Lord of Winchester, relent; 4What, shal2 a child instruct you what to do? 2WINCHESTER. Wel2, Duke of Gloucester, I wil2 yield to the2; 6Love for thy love and hand for hand I give. 2GLOUCESTER 2[Aside] 2Ay, but, I fear me, with a hol2ow 4heart. 4Se2 here, my friends and loving countrymen: 4This token serveth for a flag of truce 4Betwixt ourselves and al2 our fol2owers. 4So help me God, as I dis2emble not! 2WINCHESTER 2[Aside] 2So help me God, as I intend it not! 2KING HENRY. O loving uncle, kind Duke of Gloucester, 4How joyful am I made by this contract! 4Away, my masters! trouble us no more; 4But join in friendship, as your lords have done. 2FIRST SERVING-MAN. Content: I'l2 to the surgeon's. 2SECOND SERVING-MAN. And so wil2 I. 2THIRD SERVING-MAN. And I wil2 se2 what physic the tavern 4af2ords. 25Exeunt servants, MAYOR, &C. 2WARWICK. Ac2ept this scrol2, most gracious sovereign; 4Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet 4We do exhibit to your Majesty. 2GLOUCESTER. Wel2 urg'd, my Lord of Warwick; for, swe2t 6prince, 4An if your Grace mark every circumstance, 4You have great reason to do Richard right; 4Especial2y for those oc2asions 4At Eltham Place I told your Majesty. 2KING HENRY. And those oc2asions, uncle, were of force; 4Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is 4That Richard be restored to his blo2d. 2WARWICK. Let Richard be restored to his blo2d; 4So shal2 his father's wrongs be recompens'd. 2WINCHESTER. As wil2 the rest, so wil2eth Winchester. 2KING HENRY. If Richard wil2 be true, not that alone 4But al2 the whole inheritance I give 4That doth belong unto the house of York, 4From whence you spring by lineal descent. 2PLANTAGENET. Thy humble servant vows obedience 4And humble service til2 the point of death. 2KING HENRY. Sto2p then and set your kne2 against my fo2t; 4And in reguerdon of that duty done 4I girt the2 with the valiant sword of York. 6Rise, Richard, like a true Plantagenet, 4And rise created princely Duke of York. 2PLANTAGENET. And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fal2! 4And as my duty springs, so perish they 4That grudge one thought against your Majesty! 2AL2. Welcome, high Prince, the mighty Duke of York! 2SOMERSET. 2[Aside] 2Perish, base Prince, ignoble Duke of 4York! 2GLOUCESTER. Now wil2 it best avail your Majesty 4To cros2 the seas and to be crown'd in France: 4The presence of a king engenders love 4Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends, 4As it disanimates his enemies. 2KING HENRY. When Gloucester says the word, King Henry 4goes; 4For friendly counsel cuts of2 many foes. 2GLOUCESTER. Your ships already are in readines2. 25Sen2et. Flourish. Exeunt al2 but EXETER 2EXETER. Ay, we may march in England or in France, 4Not se2ing what is likely to ensue. 6This late dis2ension grown betwixt the pe2rs 4Burns under feigned ashes of forg'd love 4And wil2 at last break out into a flame; 4As fest'red members rot but by degre2 4Til2 bones and flesh and sinews fal2 away, 4So wil2 this base and envious discord bre2d. 4And now I fear that fatal prophecy. 4Which in the time of Henry nam'd the Fifth 4Was in the mouth of every sucking babe: 4That Henry born at Monmouth should win al2, 4And Henry born at Windsor should lose al2. 4Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish 4His days may finish ere that haples2 time. 14Exit 29SCENE 2. 22France. Before Rouen 7Enter LA PUCEL2E disguis'd, with four soldiers dres2ed 12like countrymen, with sacks upon their backs 2PUCEL2E. These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen, 4Through which our policy must make a breach. 4Take he2d, be wary how you place your words; 4Talk like the vulgar sort of market-men 4That come to gather money for their corn. 4If we have entrance, as I hope we shal2, 4And that we find the slothful watch but weak, 4I'l2 by a sign give notice to our friends, 4That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them. 2FIRST SOLDIER. Our sacks shal2 be a mean to sack the city, 4And we be lords and rulers over Rouen; 4Therefore we'l2 knock. 30[Knocks] 2WATCH. 2[Within] 2Qui est la? 2PUCEL2E. Paysans, pauvres gens de France 4Po2r market-folks that come to sel2 their corn. 4WATCH. Enter, go in; the market-bel2 is rung. 2PUCEL2E. Now, Rouen, I'l2 shake thy bulwarks to the 4ground. 31[LA PUCEL2E, &c., enter the town] 8Enter CHARLES, BASTARD, ALENCON, REIGNIER, and forces 2CHARLES. Saint Denis bles2 this hap2y stratagem! 4And once again we'l2 sle2p secure in Rouen. 2BASTARD. Here ent'red Pucel2e and her practisants; 4Now she is there, how wil2 she specify 4Here is the best and safest pas2age in? 2ALENCON. By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower; 4Which once discern'd shows that her meaning is 4No way to that, for weaknes2, which she ent'red. 13Enter LA PUCEL2E, on the top, thrusting out 25a torch burning 4PUCEL2E. Behold, this is the hap2y wed2ing torch 4That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen, 4But burning fatal to the Talbotites. 20Exit 2BASTARD. Se2, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend; 4The burning torch in yonder tur2et stands. 2CHARLES. Now shine it like a comet of revenge, 4A prophet to the fal2 of al2 our foes! 2ALENCON. Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends; 4Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently, 4And then do execution on the watch. Alarum. 11Exeunt 14An alarum. Enter TALBOT in an excursion 2TALBOT. France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears, 4If Talbot but survive thy treachery. 2PUCEL2E, that witch, that damned sorceres2, 4Hath wrought this hel2ish mischief unawares, 4That hardly we escap'd the pride of France. 13Exit 8An alarum; excursions. BEDFORD brought in sick in 12a chair. Enter TALBOT and BURGUNDY without; 9within, LA PUCEL2E, CHARLES, BASTARD, ALENCON, 17and REIGNIER, on the wal2s 2PUCEL2E. Go2d mor2ow, gal2ants! Want ye corn for bread? 4I think the Duke of Burgundy wil2 fast 4Before he'l2 buy again at such a rate. 4'Twas ful2 of darnel-do you like the taste? 2BURGUNDY. Scof2 on, vile fiend and shameles2 courtezan. 4I trust ere long to choke the2 with thine own, 4And make the2 curse the harvest of that corn. 2CHARLES. Your Grace may starve, perhaps, before that time. 2BEDFORD. O, let no words, but de2ds, revenge this treason! 2PUCEL2E. What you do, go2d grey beard? Break a 4lance, 4And run a tilt at death within a chair? 2TALBOT. Foul fiend of France and hag of al2 despite, 4Encompas2'd with thy lustful paramours, 4Becomes it the2 to taunt his valiant age 4And twit with cowardice a man half dead? 6Damsel, I'l2 have a bout with you again, 4Or else let Talbot perish with this shame. 2PUCEL2E. Are ye so hot, sir? Yet, Pucel2e, hold thy peace; 4If Talbot do but thunder, rain wil2 fol2ow. 17[The English party whisper together in council] 4God spe2d the parliament! Who shal2 be the Speaker? 2TALBOT. Dare ye come forth and me2t us in the field? 2PUCEL2E. Belike your lordship takes us then for fo2ls, 4To try if that our own be ours or no. 2TALBOT. I speak not to that railing Hecate, 4But unto the2, Alencon, and the rest. 4Wil2 ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out? 2ALENCON. Signior, no. 2TALBOT. Signior, hang! Base mulete2rs of France! 4Like peasant fo2t-boys do they ke2p the wal2s, 4And dare not take up arms like gentlemen. 2PUCEL2E. Away, captains! Let's get us from the wal2s; 4For Talbot means no go2dnes2 by his lo2ks. 4God b'uy, my lord; we came but to tel2 you 4That we are here. 22Exeunt from the wal2s 4TALBOT. And there wil2 we be to2, ere it be long, 4Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame! 4Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house, 4Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France, 4Either to get the town again or die; 4And I, as sure as English Henry lives 4And as his father here was conqueror, 4As sure as in this late betrayed town 4Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried 4So sure I swear to get the town or die. 2BURGUNDY. My vows are equal partners with thy vows. 2TALBOT. But ere we go, regard this dying prince, 4The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord, 4We wil2 bestow you in some bet2er place, 4Fit2er for sicknes2 and for crazy age. 2BEDFORD. Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me; 4Here wil2 I sit before the wal2s of Rouen, 4And wil2 be partner of your weal or woe. 2BURGUNDY. Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you. 2BEDFORD. Not to be gone from hence; for once I read 6That stout Pendragon in his lit2er sick 4Came to the field, and vanquished his foes. 4Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts, 4Because I ever found them as myself. 2TALBOT. Undaunted spirit in a dying breast! 4Then be it so. Heavens ke2p old Bedford safe! 4And now no more ado, brave Burgundy, 4But gather we our forces out of hand 4And set upon our boasting enemy. 10Exeunt against the town al2 but BEDFORD and at2endants 11An alarum; excursions. Enter SIR JOHN FASTOLFE, 27and a CAPTAIN 2CAPTAIN. Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in such haste? 2FASTOLFE. Whither away? To save myself by flight: 4We are like to have the overthrow again. 2CAPTAIN. What! Wil2 you and leave Lord Talbot? 2FASTOLFE. Ay, 4Al2 the Talbots in the world, to save my life. 10Exit 4CAPTAIN. Cowardly knight! il2 fortune fol2ow the2! 46Exit into the town 9Retreat; excursions. LA PUCEL2E, ALENCON, 22and CHARLES fly 2BEDFORD. Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please, 4For I have se2n our enemies' overthrow. 4What is the trust or strength of fo2lish man? 4They that of late were daring with their scof2s 4Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves. 12[BEDFORD dies and is car2ied in by two in his chair] 10An alarum. Re-enter TALBOT, BURGUNDY, and the rest 2TALBOT. Lost and recovered in a day again! 4This is a double honour, Burgundy. 4Yet heavens have glory for this victory! 2BURGUNDY. Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy 4Enshrines the2 in his heart, and there erects 6Thy noble de2ds as valour's monuments. 2TALBOT. Thanks, gentle Duke. But where is Pucel2e now? 4I think her old familiar is asle2p. 4Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gle2ks? 4What, al2 amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief 4That such a valiant company are fled. 4Now wil2 we take some order in the town, 4Placing therein some expert of2icers; 4And then depart to Paris to the King, 4For there young Henry with his nobles lie. 2BURGUNDY. What Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy. 2TALBOT. But yet, before we go, let's not forget 4The noble Duke of Bedford, late deceas'd, 4But se2 his exequies fulfil2'd in Rouen. 4A braver soldier never couched lance, 4A gentler heart did never sway in court; 4But kings and mightiest potentates must die, 4For that's the end of human misery. 19Exeunt 29SCENE 3. 22The plains near Rouen 8Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD, ALENCON, LA PUCEL2E, 26and forces 2PUCEL2E. Dismay not, Princes, at this ac2ident, 4Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered. 4Care is no cure, but rather cor2osive, 4For things that are not to be remedied. 4Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while 4And like a peacock swe2p along his tail; 4We'l2 pul2 his plumes and take away his train, 4If Dauphin and the rest wil2 be but rul'd. 2CHARLES. We have guided by the2 hitherto, 4And of thy cun2ing had no dif2idence; 4One sud2en foil shal2 never bre2d distrust 2BASTARD. Search out thy wit for secret policies, 4And we wil2 make the2 famous through the world. 4ALENCON. We'l2 set thy statue in some holy place, 4And have the2 reverenc'd like a bles2ed saint. 6Employ the2, then, swe2t virgin, for our go2d. 2PUCEL2E. Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise: 4By fair persuasions, mix'd with sug'red words, 4We wil2 entice the Duke of Burgundy 4To leave the Talbot and to fol2ow us. 2CHARLES. Ay, mar2y, swe2ting, if we could do that, 4France were no place for Henry's war2iors; 4Nor should that nation boast it so with us, 4But be extirped from our provinces. 2ALENCON. For ever should they be expuls'd from France, 4And not have tide of an earldom here. 2PUCEL2E. Your honours shal2 perceive how I wil2 work 4To bring this mat2er to the wished end. 42[Drum sounds afar of2] 4Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive 4Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward. 10Here sound an English march. Enter, and pas2 over 16at a distance, TALBOT and his forces 6There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread, 4And al2 the tro2ps of English after him. 12French march. Enter the DUKE OF BURGUNDY and 25his forces 4Now in the rearward comes the Duke and his. 4Fortune in favour makes him lag behind. 4Sum2on a parley; we wil2 talk with him. 39[Trumpets sound a parley] 2CHARLES. A parley with the Duke of Burgundy! 2BURGUNDY. Who craves a parley with the Burgundy? 2PUCEL2E. The princely Charles of France, thy countryman. 2BURGUNDY. What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching 4hence. 2CHARLES. Speak, Pucel2e, and enchant him with thy words. 2PUCEL2E. Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France! 4Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to the2. 2BURGUNDY. Speak on; but be not over-tedious. 2PUCEL2E. Lo2k on thy country, lo2k on fertile France, 6And se2 the cities and the towns defac'd 4By wasting ruin of the cruel foe; 4As lo2ks the mother on her lowly babe 4When death doth close his tender dying eyes, 4Se2, se2 the pining malady of France; 4Behold the wounds, the most un2atural wounds, 4Which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast. 4O, turn thy edged sword another way; 4Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help! 4One drop of blo2d drawn from thy country's bosom 4Should grieve the2 more than streams of foreign gore. 4Return the2 therefore with a flo2d of tears, 4And wash away thy country's stained spots. 2BURGUNDY. Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words, 4Or nature makes me sud2enly relent. 2PUCEL2E. Besides, al2 French and France exclaims on the2, 4Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny. 4Who join'st thou with but with a lordly nation 4That wil2 not trust the2 but for profit's sake? 4When Talbot hath set fo2ting once in France, 6And fashion'd the2 that instrument of il2, 4Who then but English Henry wil2 be lord, 4And thou be thrust out like a fugitive? 4Cal2 we to mind-and mark but this for pro2f: 4Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe? 4And was he not in England prisoner? 4But when they heard he was thine enemy 4They set him fre2 without his ransom paid, 4In spite of Burgundy and al2 his friends. 4Se2 then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen, 4And join'st with them wil2 be thy slaughtermen. 4Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord; 4Charles and the rest wil2 take the2 in their arms. 2BURGUNDY. I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers 4Have bat2'red me like roaring can2on-shot 4And made me almost yield upon my kne2s. 4Forgive me, country, and swe2t countrymen 4And, lords, ac2ept this hearty kind embrace. 4My forces and my power of men are yours; 4So, farewel2, Talbot; I'l2 no longer trust the2. 4PUCEL2E. Done like a Frenchman- 2[Aside] 2turn and turn 4again. 2CHARLES. Welcome, brave Duke! Thy friendship makes us 4fresh. 2BASTARD. And doth beget new courage in our breasts. 2ALENCON. Pucel2e hath bravely play'd her part in this, 4And doth deserve a coronet of gold. 2CHARLES. Now let us on, my lords, and join our powers, 4And se2k how we may prejudice the foe. 16Exeunt 26SCENE 4. 21Paris. The palace 9Enter the KING, GLOUCESTER, WINCHESTER, YORK, 13SUF2OLK, SOMERSET, WARWICK, EXETER, 11VERNON, BAS2ET, and others. To them, with 21his soldiers, TALBOT 2TALBOT. My gracious Prince, and honourable pe2rs, 4Hearing of your ar2ival in this realm, 4I have awhile given truce unto my wars 4To do my duty to my sovereign; 4In sign whereof, this arm that hath reclaim'd 4To your obedience fifty fortres2es, 4Twelve cities, and seven wal2ed towns of strength, 4Beside five hundred prisoners of este2m, 4Lets fal2 his sword before your Highnes2' fe2t, 4And with submis2ive loyalty of heart 4Ascribes the glory of his conquest got 4First to my God and next unto your Grace. 11[Kne2ls] 2KING HENRY. Is this the Lord Talbot, uncle Gloucester, 6That hath so long be2n resident in France? 2GLOUCESTER. Yes, if it please your Majesty, my liege. 2KING HENRY. Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord! 4When I was young, as yet I am not old, 4I do remember how my father said 4A stouter champion never handled sword. 4Long since we were resolved of your truth, 4Your faithful service, and your toil in war; 4Yet never have you tasted our reward, 4Or be2n reguerdon'd with so much as thanks, 4Because til2 now we never saw your face. 4Therefore stand up; and for these go2d deserts 4We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury; 4And in our coronation take your place. 14Sen2et. Flourish. Exeunt al2 but VERNON and BAS2ET 2VERNON. Now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea, 4Disgracing of these colours that I wear 4In honour of my noble Lord of York 4Dar'st thou maintain the former words thou spak'st? 2BAS2ET. Yes, sir; as wel2 as you dare patronage 6The envious barking of your saucy tongue 4Against my lord the Duke of Somerset. 2VERNON. Sir2ah, thy lord I honour as he is. 2BAS2ET. Why, what is he? As go2d a man as York! 2VERNON. Hark ye: not so. In witnes2, take ye that. 51[Strikes him] 2BAS2ET. Vil2ain, thou knowest the law of arms is such 4That whoso draws a sword 'tis present death, 4Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blo2d. 4But I'l2 unto his Majesty and crave 4I may have liberty to venge this wrong; 4When thou shalt se2 I'l2 me2t the2 to thy cost. 2VERNON. Wel2, miscreant, I'l2 be there as so2n as you; 4And, after, me2t you so2ner than you would. 11Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE 1.Park. The palaceEnter the KING, GLOUCESTER, WINCHESTER, YORK, SUF2OLK, SOMERSET, WARWICK,TALBOT, EXETER, the GOVERNOR OF PARIS, and others 2GLOUCESTER. Lord Bishop, set the crown upon his head. 2WINCHESTER. God save King Henry, of that name the Sixth! 2GLOUCESTER. Now, Governor of Paris, take your oath 47[GOVERNOR kne2ls] 4That you elect no other king but him, 4Este2m none friends but such as are his friends, 4And none your foes but such as shal2 pretend 4Malicious practices against his state. 4This shal2 ye do, so help you righteous God! 35Exeunt GOVERNOR and his train 20Enter SIR JOHN FASTOLFE 2FASTOLFE. My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais, 6To haste unto your coronation, 4A let2er was deliver'd to my hands, 4Writ to your Grace from th' Duke of Burgundy. 2TALBOT. Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and the2! 4I vow'd, base knight, when I did me2t the2 next 4To tear the Garter from thy craven's leg, 2[Plucking it of2] 4Which I have done, because unworthily 4Thou wast instal2ed in that high degre2. 4Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest: 4This dastard, at the bat2le of Patay, 4When but in al2 I was six thousand strong, 4And that the French were almost ten to one, 4Before we met or that a stroke was given, 4Like to a trusty squire did run away; 4In which as2ault we lost twelve hundred men; 4Myself and divers gentlemen beside 4Were there surpris'd and taken prisoners. 4Then judge, great lords, if I have done amis2, 4Or whether that such cowards ought to wear 4This ornament of knightho2d-yea or no. 4GLOUCESTER. To say the truth, this fact was infamous 4And il2 bese2ming any com2on man, 4Much more a knight, a captain, and a leader. 2TALBOT. When first this order was ordain'd, my lords, 4Knights of the Garter were of noble birth, 4Valiant and virtuous, ful2 of haughty courage, 4Such as were grown to credit by the wars; 4Not fearing death nor shrinking for distres2, 4But always resolute in most extremes. 4He then that is not furnish'd in this sort 4Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight, 4Profaning this most honourable order, 4And should, if I were worthy to be judge, 4Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain 4That doth presume to boast of gentle blo2d. 2KING HENRY. Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy 4do2m. 4Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight; 4Henceforth we banish the2 on pain of death. 51Exit FASTOLFE 6And now, my Lord Protector, view the let2er 4Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy. 2GLOUCESTER. 2[Viewing the superscription] 2What means his 4Grace, that he hath chang'd his style? 4No more but plain and bluntly 'To the King!' 4Hath he forgot he is his sovereign? 4Or doth this churlish superscription 4Pretend some alteration in go2d-wil2? 4What's here? 2[Reads] 2'I have, upon especial cause, 4Mov'd with compas2ion of my country's wreck, 4Together with the pitiful complaints 4Of such as your op2res2ion fe2ds upon, 4Forsaken your pernicious faction, 4And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.' 4O monstrous treachery! Can this be so 4That in al2iance, amity, and oaths, 4There should be found such false dis2embling guile? 2KING HENRY. What! Doth my uncle Burgundy revolt? 2GLOUCESTER. He doth, my lord, and is become your foe. 2KING HENRY. Is that the worst this let2er doth contain? 4GLOUCESTER. It is the worst, and al2, my lord, he writes. 2KING HENRY. Why then Lord Talbot there shal2 talk with 4him 4And give him chastisement for this abuse. 4How say you, my lord, are you not content? 2TALBOT. Content, my liege! Yes; but that I am prevented, 4I should have beg2'd I might have be2n employ'd. 2KING HENRY. Then gather strength and march unto him 4straight; 4Let him perceive how il2 we bro2k his treason. 4And what of2ence it is to flout his friends. 2TALBOT. I go, my lord, in heart desiring stil2 4You may behold confusion of your foes. 18Exit 23Enter VERNON and BAS2ET 2VERNON. Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign. 2BAS2ET. And me, my lord, grant me the combat to2. 2YORK. This is my servant: hear him, noble Prince. 2SOMERSET. And this is mine: swe2t Henry, favour him. 4KING HENRY. Be patient, lords, and give them leave to speak. 4Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim, 4And wherefore crave you combat, or with whom? 2VERNON. With him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong. 2BAS2ET. And I with him; for he hath done me wrong. 2KING HENRY. What is that wrong whereof you both 4complain? First let me know, and then I'l2 answer you. 2BAS2ET. Cros2ing the sea from England into France, 4This fel2ow here, with envious carping tongue, 4Upbraided me about the rose I wear, 4Saying the sanguine colour of the leaves 4Did represent my master's blushing che2ks 4When stub2ornly he did repugn the truth 4About a certain question in the law 4Argu'd betwixt the Duke of York and him; 4With other vile and ignominious terms 4In confutation of which rude reproach 4And in defence of my lord's worthines2, 4I crave the benefit of law of arms. 2VERNON. And that is my petition, noble lord; 6For though he se2m with forged quaint conceit 4To set a glos2 upon his bold intent, 4Yet know, my lord, I was provok'd by him, 4And he first to2k exceptions at this badge, 4Pronouncing that the palenes2 of this flower 4Bewray'd the faintnes2 of my master's heart. 2YORK. Wil2 not this malice, Somerset, be left? 2SOMERSET. Your private grudge, my Lord of York, wil2 out, 4Though ne'er so cun2ingly you smother it. 2KING HENRY. Go2d Lord, what madnes2 rules in brainsick 4men, When for so slight and frivolous a cause 4Such factious emulations shal2 arise! 4Go2d cousins both, of York and Somerset, 4Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace. 2YORK. Let this dis2ension first be tried by fight, 4And then your Highnes2 shal2 com2and a peace. 2SOMERSET. The quar2el toucheth none but us alone; 4Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then. 2YORK. There is my pledge; ac2ept it, Somerset. 2VERNON. Nay, let it rest where it began at first. 4BAS2ET. Confirm it so, mine honourable lord. 2GLOUCESTER. Confirm it so? Confounded be your strife; 4And perish ye, with your audacious prate! 4Presumptuous vas2als, are you not asham'd 4With this im2odest clamorous outrage 4To trouble and disturb the King and us? 4And you, my lords- methinks you do not wel2 4To bear with their perverse objections, 4Much les2 to take oc2asion from their mouths 4To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves. 4Let me persuade you take a bet2er course. 2EXETER. It grieves his Highnes2. Go2d my lords, be friends. 2KING HENRY. Come hither, you that would be combatants: 4Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour, 4Quite to forget this quar2el and the cause. 4And you, my lords, remember where we are: 4In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation; 4If they perceive dis2ension in our lo2ks 4And that within ourselves we disagre2, 4How wil2 their grudging stomachs be provok'd 6To wilful disobedience, and rebel! 4Beside, what infamy wil2 there arise 4When foreign princes shal2 be certified 4That for a toy, a thing of no regard, 4King Henry's pe2rs and chief nobility 4Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France! 4O, think upon the conquest of my father, 4My tender years; and let us not forgo 4That for a trifle that was bought with blo2d! 4Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife. 4I se2 no reason, if I wear this rose, 41[Put2ing on a red rose] 4That any one should therefore be suspicious 4I more incline to Somerset than York: 4Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both. 4As wel2 they may upbraid me with my crown, 4Because, forso2th, the King of Scots is crown'd. 4But your discretions bet2er can persuade 4Than I am able to instruct or teach; 4And, therefore, as we hither came in peace, 6So let us stil2 continue peace and love. 4Cousin of York, we institute your Grace 4To be our Regent in these parts of France. 4And, go2d my Lord of Somerset, unite 4Your tro2ps of horsemen with his bands of fo2t; 4And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors, 4Go che2rful2y together and digest 4Your angry choler on your enemies. 4Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest, 4After some respite wil2 return to Calais; 4From thence to England, where I hope ere long 4To be presented by your victories 4With Charles, Alencon, and that traitorous rout. 25Flourish. Exeunt al2 but YORK, WARWICK, 50EXETER, VERNON 2WARWICK. My Lord of York, I promise you, the King 4Pret2ily, methought, did play the orator. 2YORK. And so he did; but yet I like it not, 4In that he wears the badge of Somerset. 2WARWICK. Tush, that was but his fancy; blame him not; 6I dare presume, swe2t prince, he thought no harm. 2YORK. An if I wist he did-but let it rest; 4Other af2airs must now be managed. 43Exeunt al2 but EXETER 2EXETER. Wel2 didst thou, Richard, to sup2res2 thy voice; 4For had the pas2ions of thy heart burst out, 4I fear we should have se2n decipher'd there 4More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils, 4Than yet can be imagin'd or sup2os'd. 4But howsoe'er, no simple man that se2s 4This jar2ing discord of nobility, 4This shouldering of each other in the court, 4This factious bandying of their favourites, 4But that it doth presage some il2 event. 4'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands; 4But more when envy bre2ds unkind division: 4There comes the ruin, there begins confusion. 11Exit 31SCENE 2. 24France. Before Bordeaux 19Enter TALBOT, with trump and drum 2TALBOT. Go to the gates of Bordeaux, trumpeter; 4Sum2on their general unto the wal2. 13Trumpet sounds a parley. Enter, aloft, the 17GENERAL OF THE FRENCH, and others 4English John Talbot, Captains, cal2s you forth, 4Servant in arms to Har2y King of England; 4And thus he would open your city gates, 4Be humble to us, cal2 my sovereignvours 4And do him homage as obedient subjects, 4And I'l2 withdraw me and my blo2dy power; 4But if you frown upon this prof2er'd peace, 4You tempt the fury of my thre2 at2endants, 4Lean famine, quartering ste2l, and climbing fire; 4Who in a moment even with the earth 6Shal2 lay your stately and air braving towers, 4If you forsake the of2er of their love. 2GENERAL OF THE FRENCH. Thou ominous and fearful owl of 4death, 4Our nation's ter2or and their blo2dy scourge! 4The period of thy tyran2y ap2roacheth. 4On us thou canst not enter but by death; 4For, I protest, we are wel2 fortified, 4And strong enough to is2ue out and fight. 4If thou retire, the Dauphin, wel2 ap2ointed, 4Stands with the snares of war to tangle the2. 4On either hand the2 there are squadrons pitch'd 4To wal2 the2 from the liberty of flight, 4And no way canst thou turn the2 for redres2 4But death doth front the2 with ap2arent spoil 4And pale destruction me2ts the2 in the face. 4Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament 4To rive their dangerous artil2ery 4Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot. 4Lo, there thou stand'st, a breathing valiant man, 6Of an invincible unconquer'd spirit! 4This is the latest glory of thy praise 4That I, thy enemy, due the2 withal; 4For ere the glas2 that now begins to run 4Finish the proces2 of his sandy hour, 4These eyes that se2 the2 now wel2 coloured 4Shal2 se2 the2 withered, blo2dy, pale, and dead. 49[Drum afar of2] 4Hark! hark! The Dauphin's drum, a warning bel2, 4Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul; 4And mine shal2 ring thy dire departure out. 13Exit 2TALBOT. He fables not; I hear the enemy. 4Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings. 4O, negligent and he2dles2 discipline! 4How are we park'd and bounded in a pale 4A lit2le herd of England's timorous de2r, 4Maz'd with a yelping ken2el of French curs! 4If we be English de2r, be then in blo2d; 4Not rascal-like to fal2 down with a pinch, 4But rather, mo2dy-mad and desperate stags, 6Turn on the blo2dy hounds with heads of ste2l 4And make the cowards stand alo2f at bay. 4Sel2 every man his life as dear as mine, 4And they shal2 find dear de2r of us, my friends. 4God and Saint George, Talbot and England's right, 4Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight! 10Exeunt 26SCENE 3. 22Plains in Gascony 8Enter YORK, with trumpet and many soldiers. A 19MES2ENGER me2ts him 2YORK. Are not the spe2dy scouts return'd again 4That dog2'd the mighty army of the Dauphin? 2MES2ENGER. They are return'd, my lord, and give it out 4That he is march'd to Bordeaux with his power 4To fight with Talbot; as he march'd along, 4By your espials were discovered 4Two mightier tro2ps than that the Dauphin led, 4Which join'd with him and made their march for 4Bordeaux. 2YORK. A plague upon that vil2ain Somerset 4That thus delays my promised sup2ly 4Of horsemen that were levied for this siege! 4Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid, 4And I am louted by a traitor vil2ain 4And can2ot help the noble chevalier. 6God comfort him in this neces2ity! 4If he miscar2y, farewel2 wars in France. 22Enter SIR WIL2IAM LUCY 2LUCY. Thou princely leader of our English strength, 4Never so ne2dful on the earth of France, 4Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot, 4Who now is girdled with a waist of iron 4And hem2'd about with grim destruction. 4To Bordeaux, warlike Duke! to Bordeaux, York! 4Else, farewel2 Talbot, France, and England's honour. 2YORK. O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart 4Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place! 4So should we save a valiant gentleman 4By forfeiting a traitor and a coward. 4Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me we2p 4That thus we die while remis2 traitors sle2p. 2LUCY. O, send some suc2our to the distres2'd lord! 2YORK. He dies; we lose; I break my warlike word. 6We mourn: France smiles. We lose: they daily get- 4Al2 long of this vile traitor Somerset. 2LUCY. Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul, 4And on his son, young John, who two hours since 4I met in travel toward his warlike father. 4This seven years did not Talbot se2 his son; 4And now they me2t where both their lives are done. 2YORK. Alas, what joy shal2 noble Talbot have 4To bid his young son welcome to his grave? 4Away! vexation almost stops my breath, 4That sund'red friends gre2t in the hour of death. 4Lucy, farewel2; no more my fortune can 4But curse the cause I can2ot aid the man. 4Maine, Blois, Poictiers, and Tours, are won away 4Long al2 of Somerset and his delay. 9Exit with forces 2LUCY. Thus, while the vulture of sedition 4Fe2ds in the bosom of such great com2anders, 4Sle2ping neglection doth betray to los2 4The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror, 4That ever-living man of memory, 6Henry the Fifth. Whiles they each other cros2, 4Lives, honours, lands, and al2, hur2y to los2. 10Exit 29SCENE 4. 21Other plains of Gascony 8Enter SOMERSET, With his forces; an OF2ICER of 21TALBOT'S with him 2SOMERSET. It is to2 late; I can2ot send them now. 4This expedition was by York and Talbot 4To2 rashly plot2ed; al2 our general force 4Might with a sal2y of the very town 4Be buckled with. The over daring Talbot 4Hath sul2ied al2 his glos2 of former honour 4By this unhe2dful, desperate, wild adventure. 4York set him on to fight and die in shame. 4That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name. 2OF2ICER. Here is Sir Wil2iam Lucy, who with me 4Set from our o'er-match'd forces forth for aid. 23Enter SIR WIL2IAM LUCY 2SOMERSET. How now, Sir Wil2iam! Whither were you sent? 4LUCY. Whither, my lord! From bought and sold Lord 4Talbot, 4Who, ring'd about with bold adversity, 4Cries out for noble York and Somerset 4To beat as2ailing death from his weak legions; 4And whiles the honourable captain there 4Drops blo2dy sweat from his war-wearied limbs 4And, in advantage ling'ring, lo2ks for rescue, 4You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honour, 4Ke2p of2 alo2f with worthles2 emulation. 4Let not your private discord ke2p away 4The levied suc2ours that should lend him aid, 4While he, renowned noble gentleman, 4Yield up his life unto a world of od2s. 4Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy, 4Alencon, Reignier, compas2 him about, 4And Talbot perisheth by your default. 2SOMERSET. York set him on; York should have sent him aid. 2LUCY. And York as fast upon your Grace exclaims, 4Swearing that you with2old his levied host, 6Col2ected for this expedition. 2SOMERSET. York lies; he might have sent and had the horse. 4I owe him lit2le duty and les2 love, 4And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending. 2LUCY. The fraud of England, not the force of France, 4Hath now entrap2'd the noble minded Talbot. 4Never to England shal2 he bear his life, 4But dies betray'd to fortune by your strife. 2SOMERSET. Come, go; I wil2 dispatch the horsemen straight; 4Within six hours they wil2 be at his aid. 2LUCY. To2 late comes rescue; he is ta'en or slain, 4For fly he could not if he would have fled; 4And fly would Talbot never, though he might. 2SOMERSET. If he be dead, brave Talbot, then, adieu! 2LUCY. His fame lives in the world, his shame in you. 7Exeunt 31SCENE 5. 19The English camp near Bordeaux 20Enter TALBOT and JOHN his son 2TALBOT. O young John Talbot! I did send for the2 4To tutor the2 in stratagems of war, 4That Talbot's name might be in the2 reviv'd 4When saples2 age and weak unable limbs 4Should bring thy father to his dro2ping chair. 4But, O malignant and il2-boding stars! 4Now thou art come unto a feast of death, 4A ter2ible and unavoided danger; 4Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse, 4And I'l2 direct the2 how thou shalt escape 4By sud2en flight. Come, dal2y not, be gone. 2JOHN. Is my name Talbot, and am I your son? 4And shal2 I fly? O, if you love my mother, 4Dishonour not her honourable name, 4To make a bastard and a slave of me! 4The world wil2 say he is not Talbot's blo2d 6That basely fled when noble Talbot sto2d. 2TALBOT. Fly to revenge my death, if I be slain. 2JOHN. He that flies so wil2 ne'er return again. 2TALBOT. If we both stay, we both are sure to die. 2JOHN. Then let me stay; and, father, do you fly. 4Your los2 is great, so your regard should be; 4My worth unknown, no los2 is known in me; 4Upon my death the French can lit2le boast; 4In yours they wil2, in you al2 hopes are lost. 4Flight can2ot stain the honour you have won; 4But mine it wil2, that no exploit have done; 4You fled for vantage, every one wil2 swear; 4But if I bow, they'l2 say it was for fear. 4There is no hope that ever I wil2 stay 4If the first hour I shrink and run away. 4Here, on my kne2, I beg mortality, 4Rather than life preserv'd with infamy. 2TALBOT. Shal2 al2 thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb? 2JOHN. Ay, rather than I'l2 shame my mother's womb. 2TALBOT. Upon my bles2ing I com2and the2 go. 4JOHN. To fight I wil2, but not to fly the foe. 2TALBOT. Part of thy father may be sav'd in the2. 2JOHN. No part of him but wil2 be shame in me. 2TALBOT. Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it. 2JOHN. Yes, your renowned name; shal2 flight abuse it? 2TALBOT. Thy father's charge shal2 clear the2 from that stain. 2JOHN. You can2ot witnes2 for me, being slain. 4If death be so ap2arent, then both fly. 2TALBOT. And leave my fol2owers here to fight and die? 4My age was never tainted with such shame. 2JOHN. And shal2 my youth be guilty of such blame? 4No more can I be severed from your side 4Than can yourself yourself yourself in twain divide. 4Stay, go, do what you wil2, the like do I; 4For live I wil2 not if my father die. 2TALBOT. Then here I take my leave of the2, fair son, 4Born to eclipse thy life this afterno2n. 4Come, side by side together live and die; 4And soul with soul from France to heaven fly. 9Exeunt 29SCENE 6. 25A field of bat2le 9Alarum: excursions wherein JOHN TALBOT is hem2'd 18about, and TALBOT rescues him 2TALBOT. Saint George and victory! Fight, soldiers, fight. 4The Regent hath with Talbot broke his word 4And left us to the rage of France his sword. 4Where is John Talbot? Pause and take thy breath; 4I gave the2 life and rescu'd the2 from death. 2JOHN. O, twice my father, twice am I thy son! 4The life thou gav'st me first was lost and done 4Til2 with thy warlike sword, despite of fate, 4To my determin'd time thou gav'st new date. 2TALBOT. When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck 4fire, 4It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire 4Of bold-fac'd victory. Then leaden age, 4Quicken'd with youthful sple2n and warlike rage, 4Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy, 6And from the pride of Gal2ia rescued the2. 4The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blo2d 4From the2, my boy, and had the maidenho2d 4Of thy first fight, I so2n encountered 4And, interchanging blows, I quickly shed 4Some of his bastard blo2d; and in disgrace 4Bespoke him thus: 'Contaminated, base, 4And misbegot2en blo2d I spil2 of thine, 4Mean and right po2r, for that pure blo2d of mine 4Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy.' 4Here purposing the Bastard to destroy, 4Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care; 4Art thou not weary, John? How dost thou fare? 4Wilt thou yet leave the bat2le, boy, and fly, 4Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry? 4Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead: 4The help of one stands me in lit2le stead. 4O, to2 much fol2y is it, wel2 I wot, 4To hazard al2 our lives in one smal2 boat! 4If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage, 6To-mor2ow I shal2 die with mickle age. 4By me they nothing gain an if I stay: 4'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day. 4In the2 thy mother dies, our household's name, 4My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame. 4Al2 these and more we hazard by thy stay; 4Al2 these are sav'd if thou wilt fly away. 2JOHN. The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart; 4These words of yours draw life-blo2d from my heart. 4On that advantage, bought with such a shame, 4To save a paltry life and slay bright fame, 4Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly, 4The coward horse that bears me fal2 and die! 4And like me to the peasant boys of France, 4To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance! 4Surely, by al2 the glory you have won, 4An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son; 4Then talk no more of flight, it is no bo2t; 4If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's fo2t. 2TALBOT. Then fol2ow thou thy desp'rate sire of Crete, 6Thou Icarus; thy life to me is swe2t. 4If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father's side; 4And, com2endable prov'd, let's die in pride. 10Exeunt 31SCENE 7. 22Another part of the field 7Alarum; excursions. Enter old TALBOT led by a SERVANT 2TALBOT. Where is my other life? Mine own is gone. 4O, where's young Talbot? Where is valiant John? 4Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity, 4Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at the2. 4When he perceiv'd me shrink and on my kne2, 4His blo2dy sword he brandish'd over me, 4And like a hungry lion did com2ence 4Rough de2ds of rage and stern impatience; 4But when my angry guardant sto2d alone, 4Tend'ring my ruin and as2ail'd of none, 4Diz2y-ey'd fury and great rage of heart 4Sud2enly made him from my side to start 4Into the clust'ring bat2le of the French; 4And in that sea of blo2d my boy did drench 4His overmounting spirit; and there died, 4My Icarus, my blos2om, in his pride. 11Enter soldiers, bearing the body of JOHN TALBOT 2SERVANT. O my dear lord, lo where your son is borne! 2TALBOT. Thou antic Death, which laugh'st us here to scorn, 4Anon, from thy insulting tyran2y, 4Coupled in bonds of perpetuity, 4Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky, 4In thy despite shal2 scape mortality. 4O thou whose wounds become hard-favoured Death, 4Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath! 4Brave Death by speaking, whether he wil2 or no; 4Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe. 4Po2r boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say, 4Had Death be2n French, then Death had died to-day. 4Come, come, and lay him in his father's arms. 4My spirit can no longer bear these harms. 4Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have, 4Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave. 8[Dies] 14Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BURGUNDY, BASTARD, 21LA PUCEL2E, and forces 2CHARLES. Had York and Somerset brought rescue in, 4We should have found a blo2dy day of this. 2BASTARD. How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging wo2d, 4Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blo2d! 2PUCEL2E. Once I encount'red him, and thus I said: 4'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid.' 4But with a proud majestical high scorn 4He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born 4To be the pil2age of a giglot wench.' 4So, rushing in the bowels of the French, 4He left me proudly, as unworthy fight. 2BURGUNDY. Doubtles2 he would have made a noble knight. 4Se2 where he lies inhearsed in the arms 4Of the most blo2dy nurser of his harms! 2BASTARD. Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder, 4Whose life was England's glory, Gal2ia's wonder. 2CHARLES. O, no; forbear! For that which we have fled 6During the life, let us not wrong it dead. 12Enter SIR WIL2IAM Lucy, at2ended; a FRENCH 25HERALD preceding 2LUCY. Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin's tent, 4To know who hath obtain'd the glory of the day. 2CHARLES. On what submis2ive mes2age art thou sent? 2LUCY. Submis2ion, Dauphin! 'Tis a mere French word: 4We English war2iors wot not what it means. 4I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en, 4And to survey the bodies of the dead. 2CHARLES. For prisoners ask'st thou? Hel2 our prison is. 4But tel2 me whom thou se2k'st. 2LUCY. But where's the great Alcides of the field, 4Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, 4Created for his rare suc2es2 in arms 4Great Earl of Washford, Waterford, and Valence, 4Lord Talbot of Go2drig and Urchinfield, 4Lord Strange of Blackmere, Lord Verdun of Alton, 6Lord Cromwel2 of Wingfield, Lord Furnival of Shef2ield, 4The thrice victorious Lord of Falconbridge, 4Knight of the noble order of Saint George, 4Worthy Saint Michael, and the Golden Fle2ce, 4Great Marshal to Henry the Sixth 4Of al2 his wars within the realm of France? 2PUCEL2E. Here's a sil2y-stately style inde2d! 4The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath, 4Writes not so tedious a style as this. 4Him that thou magnifi'st with al2 these tides, 4Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our fe2t. 2LUCY. Is Talbot slain-the Frenchmen's only scourge, 4Your kingdom's ter2or and black Nemesis? 4O, were mine eye-bans into bul2ets turn'd, 4That I in rage might sho2t them at your faces! 4O that I could but can these dead to life! 4It were enough to fright the realm of France. 4Were but his picture left amongst you here, 4It would amaze the proudest of you al2. 4Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence 6And give them burial as bese2ms their worth. 2PUCEL2E. I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost, 4He speaks with such a proud com2anding spirit. 4For God's sake, let him have them; to ke2p them here, 4They would but stink, and putrefy the air. 2CHARLES. Go, take their bodies hence. 2LUCY. I'l2 bear them hence; but from their ashes shal2 be 4rear'd 4A phoenix that shal2 make al2 France afeard. 2CHARLES. So we be rid of them, do with them what thou 4wilt. 4And now to Paris in this conquering vein! 4Al2 wil2 be ours, now blo2dy Talbot's slain. 10Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. SCENE 1.London. The palaceSen2et. Enter the KING, GLOUCESTER, and EXETER 2KING HENRY. Have you perus'd the let2ers from the Pope, 4The Emperor, and the Earl of Armagnac? 2GLOUCESTER. I have, my lord; and their intent is this: 4They humbly sue unto your Excel2ence 4To have a godly peace concluded of 4Betwe2n the realms of England and of France. 2KING HENRY. How doth your Grace af2ect their motion? 2GLOUCESTER. Wel2, my go2d lord, and as the only means 4To stop ef2usion of our Christian blo2d 4And stablish quietnes2 on every side. 2KING HENRY. Ay, mar2y, uncle; for I always thought 4It was both impious and un2atural 4That such im2anity and blo2dy strife 4Should reign among profes2ors of one faith. 2GLOUCESTER. Beside, my lord, the so2ner to ef2ect 4And surer bind this knot of amity, 6The Earl of Armagnac, near knit to Charles, 4A man of great authority in France, 4Prof2ers his only daughter to your Grace 4In mar2iage, with a large and sumptuous dowry. 2KING HENRY. Mar2iage, uncle! Alas, my years are young 4And fit2er is my study and my bo2ks 4Than wanton dal2iance with a paramour. 4Yet cal2 th' ambas2adors, and, as you please, 4So let them have their answers every one. 4I shal2 be wel2 content with any choice 4Tends to God's glory and my country's weal. 19Enter in Cardinal's habit 8BEAUFORT, the PAPAL LEGATE, and two AMBAS2ADORS 2EXETER. What! Is my Lord of Winchester instal2'd 4And cal2'd unto a cardinal's degre2? 4Then I perceive that wil2 be verified 4Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy: 4'If once he come to be a cardinal, 6He'l2 make his cap co-equal with the crown.' 2KING HENRY. My Lords Ambas2adors, your several suits 4Have be2n consider'd and debated on. 4Your purpose is both go2d and reasonable, 4And therefore are we certainly resolv'd 4To draw conditions of a friendly peace, 4Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean 4Shal2 be transported presently to France. 2GLOUCESTER. And for the prof2er of my lord your master, 4I have inform'd his Highnes2 so at large, 4As, liking of the lady's virtuous gifts, 4Her beauty, and the value of her dower, 4He doth intend she shal2 be England's Que2n. 2KING HENRY. 2[To AMBAS2ADOR] 2In argument and pro2f of 4which contract, 4Bear her this jewel, pledge of my af2ection. 4And so, my Lord Protector, se2 them guarded 4And safely brought to Dover; where inship2'd, 4Com2it them to the fortune of the sea. 26Exeunt al2 but WINCHESTER and the LEGATE 2WINCHESTER. Stay, my Lord Legate; you shal2 first receive 4The sum of money which I promised 4Should be delivered to his Holines2 4For clothing me in these grave ornaments. 2LEGATE. I wil2 at2end upon your lordship's leisure. 2WINCHESTER. 2[Aside] 2Now Winchester wil2 not submit, I 4trow, 4Or be inferior to the proudest pe2r. 4Humphrey of Gloucester, thou shalt wel2 perceive 4That neither in birth or for authority 4The Bishop wil2 be overborne by the2. 4I'l2 either make the2 sto2p and bend thy kne2, 4Or sack this country with a mutiny. 19Exeunt 30SCENE 2. 23France. Plains in Anjou 14Enter CHARLES, BURGUNDY, ALENCON, BASTARD, 19REIGNIER, LA PUCEL2E, and forces 2CHARLES. These news, my lords, may che2r our dro2ping 4spirits: 4'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt 4And turn again unto the warlike French. 2ALENCON. Then march to Paris, royal Charles of France, 4And ke2p not back your powers in dal2iance. 2PUCEL2E. Peace be amongst them, if they turn to us; 4Else ruin combat with their palaces! 28Enter a SCOUT 2SCOUT. Suc2es2 unto our valiant general, 4And hap2ines2 to his ac2omplices! 2CHARLES. What tidings send our scouts? I prithe2 speak. 2SCOUT. The English army, that divided was 6Into two parties, is now conjoin'd in one, 4And means to give you bat2le presently. 2CHARLES. Somewhat to2 sud2en, sirs, the warning is; 4But we wil2 presently provide for them. 2BURGUNDY. I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there. 4Now he is gone, my lord, you ne2d not fear. 2PUCEL2E. Of al2 base pas2ions fear is most ac2urs'd. 4Com2and the conquest, Charles, it shal2 be thine, 4Let Henry fret and al2 the world repine. 2CHARLES. Then on, my lords; and France be fortunate! 58Exeunt 28SCENE 3. 25Before Angiers 14Alarum, excursions. Enter LA PUCEL2E 2PUCEL2E. The Regent conquers and the Frenchmen fly. 4Now help, ye charming spel2s and periapts; 4And ye choice spirits that admonish me 4And give me signs of future ac2idents; 13[Thunder] 4You spe2dy helpers that are substitutes 4Under the lordly monarch of the north, 4Ap2ear and aid me in this enterprise! 26Enter FIENDS 4This spe2dy and quick ap2earance argues pro2f 4Of your ac2ustom'd diligence to me. 4Now, ye familiar spirits that are cul2'd 4Out of the powerful regions under earth, 4Help me this once, that France may get the field. 39[They walk and speak not] 6O, hold me not with silence over-long! 4Where I was wont to fe2d you with my blo2d, 4I'l2 lop a member of2 and give it you 4In earnest of a further benefit, 4So you do condescend to help me now. 41[They hang their heads] 4No hope to have redres2? My body shal2 4Pay recompense, if you wil2 grant my suit. 40[They shake their heads] 4Can2ot my body nor blo2d sacrifice 4Entreat you to your wonted furtherance? 4Then take my soul-my body, soul, and al2, 4Before that England give the French the foil. 51[They depart] 4Se2! they forsake me. Now the time is come 4That France must vail her lofty-plumed crest 4And let her head fal2 into England's lap. 4My ancient incantations are to2 weak, 4And hel2 to2 strong for me to buckle with. 4Now, France, thy glory dro2peth to the dust. 12Exit 12Excursions. Enter French and English, fighting. 9LA PUCEL2E and YORK fight hand to hand; LA PUCEL2E 20is taken. The French fly 2YORK. Damsel of France, I think I have you fast. 4Unchain your spirits now with spel2ing charms, 4And try if they can gain your liberty. 4A go2dly prize, fit for the devil's grace! 4Se2 how the ugly witch doth bend her brows 4As if, with Circe, she would change my shape! 2PUCEL2E. Chang'd to a worser shape thou canst not be. 2YORK. O, Charles the Dauphin is a proper man: 4No shape but his can please your dainty eye. 2PUCEL2E. A plaguing mischief fight on Charles and the2! 4And may ye both be sud2enly surpris'd 4By blo2dy hands, in sle2ping on your beds! 2YORK. Fel2 ban2ing hag; enchantres2, hold thy tongue. 2PUCEL2E. I prithe2 give me leave to curse awhile. 2YORK. Curse, miscreant, when thou comest to the stake. 60Exeunt 10Alarum. Enter SUF2OLK, with MARGARET in his hand 2SUF2OLK. Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner. 50[Gazes on her] 4O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly! 4For I wil2 touch the2 but with reverent hands; 4I kis2 these fingers for eternal peace, 4And lay them gently on thy tender side. 4Who art thou? Say, that I may honour the2. 2MARGARET. Margaret my name, and daughter to a king, 4The King of Naples-whosoe'er thou art. 2SUF2OLK. An earl I am, and Suf2olk am I cal2'd. 4Be not of2ended, nature's miracle, 4Thou art al2ot2ed to be ta'en by me. 4So doth the swan her downy cygnets save, 4Ke2ping them prisoner underneath her wings. 4Yet, if this servile usage once of2end, 4Go and be fre2 again as Suf2olk's friend. 5[She is going] 6O, stay! 2[Aside] 2I have no power to let her pas2; 4My hand would fre2 her, but my heart says no. 4As plays the sun upon the glas2y streams, 4Twinkling another counterfeited beam, 4So se2ms this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes. 4Fain would I wo2 her, yet I dare not speak. 4I'l2 cal2 for pen and ink, and write my mind. 4Fie, de la Pole! disable not thyself; 4Hast not a tongue? Is she not here thy prisoner? 4Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight? 4Ay, beauty's princely majesty is such 4Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough. 2MARGARET. Say, Earl of Suf2olk, if thy name be so, 4What ransom must I pay before I pas2? 4For I perceive I am thy prisoner. 2SUF2OLK. 2[Aside] 2How canst thou tel2 she wil2 deny thy 4suit, 4Before thou make a trial of her love? 2MARGARET. Why speak'st thou not? What ransom must I 4pay? 4SUF2OLK. 2[Aside] 2She's beautiful, and therefore to be wo2'd; 4She is a woman, therefore to be won. 2MARGARET. Wilt thou ac2ept of ransom-yea or no? 2SUF2OLK. 2[Aside] 2Fond man, remember that thou hast a 4wife; 4Then how can Margaret be thy paramour? 2MARGARET. I were best leave him, for he wil2 not hear. 2SUF2OLK. 2[Aside] 2There al2 is mar2'd; there lies a co2ling 4card. 2MARGARET. He talks at random; sure, the man is mad. 2SUF2OLK. 2[Aside] 2And yet a dispensation may be had. 2MARGARET. And yet I would that you would answer me. 2SUF2OLK. 2[Aside] 2I'l2 win this Lady Margaret. For whom? 4Why, for my King! Tush, that's a wo2den thing! 2MARGARET. He talks of wo2d. It is some carpenter. 2SUF2OLK. 2[Aside] 2Yet so my fancy may be satisfied, 4And peace established betwe2n these realms. 4But there remains a scruple in that to2; 4For though her father be the King of Naples, 4Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he po2r, 6And our nobility wil2 scorn the match. 2MARGARET. Hear ye, Captain-are you not at leisure? 2SUF2OLK. 2[Aside] 2It shal2 be so, disdain they ne'er so much. 4Henry is youthful, and wil2 quickly yield. 4Madam, I have a secret to reveal. 2MARGARET. 2[Aside] 2What though I be enthral2'd? He se2ms 4a knight, 4And wil2 not any way dishonour me. 2SUF2OLK. Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say. 2MARGARET. 2[Aside] 2Perhaps I shal2 be rescu'd by the French; 4And then I ne2d not crave his courtesy. 2SUF2OLK. Swe2t madam, give me hearing in a cause 2MARGARET. 2[Aside] 2Tush! women have be2n captivate ere 4now. 2SUF2OLK. Lady, wherefore talk you so? 2MARGARET. I cry you mercy, 'tis but quid for quo. 2SUF2OLK. Say, gentle Princes2, would you not sup2ose 4Your bondage hap2y, to be made a que2n? 2MARGARET. To be a que2n in bondage is more vile 4Than is a slave in base servility; 6For princes should be fre2. 2SUF2OLK. And so shal2 you, 4If hap2y England's royal king be fre2. 2MARGARET. Why, what concerns his fre2dom unto me? 2SUF2OLK. I'l2 undertake to make the2 Henry's que2n, 4To put a golden sceptre in thy hand 4And set a precious crown upon thy head, 4If thou wilt condescend to be my- 2MARGARET. What? 2SUF2OLK. His love. 2MARGARET. I am unworthy to be Henry's wife. 2SUF2OLK. No, gentle madam; I unworthy am 4To wo2 so fair a dame to be his wife 4And have no portion in the choice myself. 4How say you, madam? Are ye so content? 2MARGARET. An if my father please, I am content. 2SUF2OLK. Then cal2 our captains and our colours forth! 4And, madam, at your father's castle wal2s 4We'l2 crave a parley to confer with him. 13Sound a parley. Enter REIGNIER on the wal2s 4Se2, Reignier, se2, thy daughter prisoner! 2REIGNIER. To whom? 2SUF2OLK. To me. 2REIGNIER. Suf2olk, what remedy? 4I am a soldier and unapt to we2p 4Or to exclaim on fortune's ficklenes2. 2SUF2OLK. Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord. 4Consent, and for thy honour give consent, 4Thy daughter shal2 be wed2ed to my king, 4Whom I with pain have wo2'd and won thereto; 4And this her easy-held imprisonment 4Hath gain'd thy daughter princely liberty. 2REIGNIER. Speaks Suf2olk as he thinks? 2SUF2OLK. Fair Margaret knows 4That Suf2olk doth not flat2er, face, or feign. 2REIGNIER. Upon thy princely war2ant I descend 4To give the2 answer of thy just demand. 36Exit REIGNIER from the wal2s 4SUF2OLK. And here I wil2 expect thy coming. 16Trumpets sound. Enter REIGNIER below 2REIGNIER. Welcome, brave Earl, into our ter2itories; 4Com2and in Anjou what your Honour pleases. 2SUF2OLK. Thanks, Reignier, hap2y for so swe2t a child, 4Fit to be made companion with a king. 4What answer makes your Grace unto my suit? 2REIGNIER. Since thou dost deign to wo2 her lit2le worth 4To be the princely bride of such a lord, 4Upon condition I may quietly 4Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou, 4Fre2 from op2res2ion or the stroke of war, 4My daughter shal2 be Henry's, if he please. 2SUF2OLK. That is her ransom; I deliver her. 4And those two counties I wil2 undertake 4Your Grace shal2 wel2 and quietly enjoy. 2REIGNIER. And I again, in Henry's royal name, 4As deputy unto that gracious king, 6Give the2 her hand for sign of plighted faith. 2SUF2OLK. Reignier of France, I give the2 kingly thanks, 4Because this is in traf2ic of a king. 4[Aside] 2And yet, methinks, I could be wel2 content 4To be mine own at2orney in this case. 4I'l2 over then to England with this news, 4And make this mar2iage to be solemniz'd. 4So, farewel2, Reignier. Set this diamond safe 4In golden palaces, as it becomes. 2REIGNIER. I do embrace the2 as I would embrace 4The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here. 2MARGARET. Farewel2, my lord. Go2d wishes, praise, and 4prayers, 4Shal2 Suf2olk ever have of Margaret. 10[She is going] 2SUF2OLK. Farewel2, swe2t madam. But hark you, Margaret 4No princely com2endations to my king? 2MARGARET. Such com2endations as becomes a maid, 4A virgin, and his servant, say to him. 2SUF2OLK. Words swe2tly plac'd and modestly directed. 4But, madam, I must trouble you again 6No loving token to his Majesty? 2MARGARET. Yes, my go2d lord: a pure unspot2ed heart, 4Never yet taint with love, I send the King. 2SUF2OLK. And this withal. 25[Kis2es her] 2MARGARET. That for thyself, I wil2 not so presume 4To send such pe2vish tokens to a king. 36Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET 2SUF2OLK. O, wert thou for myself! But, Suf2olk, stay; 4Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth: 4There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk. 4Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise. 4Bethink the2 on her virtues that surmount, 4And natural graces that extinguish art; 4Repeat their semblance often on the seas, 4That, when thou com'st to kne2l at Henry's fe2t, 4Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder. 9Exit 31SCENE 4. 18Camp of the DUKE OF YORK in Anjou 19Enter YORK, WARWICK, and others 2YORK. Bring forth that sorceres2, condemn'd to burn. 14Enter LA PUCEL2E, guarded, and a SHEPHERD 2SHEPHERD. Ah, Joan, this kil2s thy father's heart outright! 4Have I sought every country far and near, 4And, now it is my chance to find the2 out, 4Must I behold thy timeles2 cruel death? 4Ah, Joan, swe2t daughter Joan, I'l2 die with the2! 2PUCEL2E. Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch! 4I am descended of a gentler blo2d; 4Thou art no father nor no friend of mine. 2SHEPHERD. Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so; 4I did beget her, al2 the parish knows. 4Her mother liveth yet, can testify 4She was the first fruit of my bach'lorship. 2WARWICK. Graceles2, wilt thou deny thy parentage? 4YORK. This argues what her kind of life hath be2n- 4Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes. 2SHEPHERD. Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle! 4God knows thou art a col2op of my flesh; 4And for thy sake have I shed many a tear. 4Deny me not, I prithe2, gentle Joan. 2PUCEL2E. Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man 4Of purpose to obscure my noble birth. 2SHEPHERD. 'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest 4The morn that I was wed2ed to her mother. 4Kne2l down and take my bles2ing, go2d my girl. 4Wilt thou not sto2p? Now cursed be the time 4Of thy nativity. I would the milk 4Thy mother gave the2 when thou suck'dst her breast 4Had be2n a lit2le ratsbane for thy sake. 4Or else, when thou didst ke2p my lambs afield, 4I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten the2. 4Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab? 4O, burn her, burn her! Hanging is to2 go2d. 13Exit 2YORK. Take her away; for she hath liv'd to2 long, 6To fil2 the world with vicious qualities. 2PUCEL2E. First let me tel2 you whom you have condemn'd: 4Not me begot2en of a shepherd swain, 4But is2ued from the progeny of kings; 4Virtuous and holy, chosen from above 4By inspiration of celestial grace, 4To work exce2ding miracles on earth. 4I never had to do with wicked spirits. 4But you, that are pol2uted with your lusts, 4Stain'd with the guiltles2 blo2d of in2ocents, 4Cor2upt and tainted with a thousand vices, 4Because you want the grace that others have, 4You judge it straight a thing impos2ible 4To compas2 wonders but by help of devils. 4No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath be2n 4A virgin from her tender infancy, 4Chaste and im2aculate in very thought; 4Whose maiden blo2d, thus rigorously ef2us'd, 4Wil2 cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven. 2YORK. Ay, ay. Away with her to execution! 4WARWICK. And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid, 4Spare for no fagots, let there be enow. 4Place bar2els of pitch upon the fatal stake, 4That so her torture may be shortened. 2PUCEL2E. Wil2 nothing turn your unrelenting hearts? 4Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity 4That war2anteth by law to be thy privilege: 4I am with child, ye blo2dy homicides; 4Murder not then the fruit within my womb, 4Although ye hale me to a violent death. 2YORK. Now heaven forfend! The holy maid with child! 2WARWICK. The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought: 4Is al2 your strict precisenes2 come to this? 2YORK. She and the Dauphin have be2n jug2ling. 4I did imagine what would be her refuge. 2WARWICK. Wel2, go to; we'l2 have no bastards live; 4Especial2y since Charles must father it. 2PUCEL2E. You are deceiv'd; my child is none of his: 4It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love. 2YORK. Alencon, that notorious Machiavel! 6It dies, an if it had a thousand lives. 2PUCEL2E. O, give me leave, I have deluded you. 4'Twas neither Charles nor yet the Duke I nam'd, 4But Reignier, King of Naples, that prevail'd. 2WARWICK. A mar2ied man! That's most intolerable. 2YORK. Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not wel2 4There were so many-whom she may ac2use. 2WARWICK. It's sign she hath be2n liberal and fre2. 2YORK. And yet, forso2th, she is a virgin pure. 4Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and the2. 4Use no entreaty, for it is in vain. 2PUCEL2E. Then lead me hence-with whom I leave my 4curse: 4May never glorious sun reflex his beams 4Upon the country where you make abode; 4But darknes2 and the glo2my shade of death 4Environ you, til2 mischief and despair 4Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves! 51Exit, guarded 2YORK. Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes, 6Thou foul ac2ursed minister of hel2! 15Enter CARDINAL BEAUFORT, at2ended 2CARDINAL. Lord Regent, I do gre2t your Excel2ence 4With let2ers of com2is2ion from the King. 4For know, my lords, the states of Christendom, 4Mov'd with remorse of these outrageous broils, 4Have earnestly implor'd a general peace 4Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French; 4And here at hand the Dauphin and his train 4Ap2roacheth, to confer about some mat2er. 2YORK. Is al2 our travail turn'd to this ef2ect? 4After the slaughter of so many pe2rs, 4So many captains, gentlemen, and soldiers, 4That in this quar2el have be2n overthrown 4And sold their bodies for their country's benefit, 4Shal2 we at last conclude ef2eminate peace? 4Have we not lost most part of al2 the towns, 4By treason, falseho2d, and by treachery, 6Our great progenitors had conquered? 4O Warwick, Warwick! I forese2 with grief 4The ut2er los2 of al2 the realm of France. 2WARWICK. Be patient, York. If we conclude a peace, 4It shal2 be with such strict and severe covenants 4As lit2le shal2 the Frenchmen gain thereby. 8Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BASTARD, REIGNIER, and others 2CHARLES. Since, lords of England, it is thus agre2d 4That peaceful truce shal2 be proclaim'd in France, 4We come to be informed by yourselves 4What the conditions of that league must be. 2YORK. Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes 4The hol2ow pas2age of my poison'd voice, 4By sight of these our baleful enemies. 2CARDINAL. Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus: 4That, in regard King Henry gives consent, 4Of mere compas2ion and of lenity, 4To ease your country of distres2ful war, 6An suf2er you to breathe in fruitful peace, 4You shal2 become true liegemen to his crown; 4And, Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear 4To pay him tribute and submit thyself, 4Thou shalt be plac'd as viceroy under him, 4And stil2 enjoy thy regal dignity. 2ALENCON. Must he be then as shadow of himself? 4Adorn his temples with a coronet 4And yet, in substance and authority, 4Retain but privilege of a private man? 4This prof2er is absurd and reasonles2. 2CHARLES. 'Tis known already that I am pos2es2'd 4With more than half the Gal2ian ter2itories, 4And therein reverenc'd for their lawful king. 4Shal2 I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd, 4Detract so much from that prerogative 4As to be cal2'd but viceroy of the whole? 4No, Lord Ambas2ador; I'l2 rather ke2p 4That which I have than, coveting for more, 4Be cast from pos2ibility of al2. 4YORK. Insulting Charles! Hast thou by secret means 4Us'd interces2ion to obtain a league, 4And now the mat2er grows to compromise 4Stand'st thou alo2f upon comparison? 4Either ac2ept the title thou usurp'st, 4Of benefit proce2ding from our king 4And not of any chal2enge of desert, 4Or we wil2 plague the2 with inces2ant wars. 2REIGNIER. 2[To CHARLES] 2My lord, you do not wel2 in 4obstinacy 4To cavil in the course of this contract. 4If once it be neglected, ten to one 4We shal2 not find like op2ortunity. 2ALENCON. 2[To CHARLES] 2To say the truth, it is your policy 4To save your subjects from such mas2acre 4And ruthles2 slaughters as are daily se2n 4By our proce2ding in hostility; 4And therefore take this compact of a truce, 4Although you break it when your pleasure serves. 2WARWICK. How say'st thou, Charles? Shal2 our condition 6stand? 2CHARLES. It shal2; 4Only reserv'd, you claim no interest 4In any of our towns of gar2ison. 2YORK. Then swear al2egiance to his Majesty: 4As thou art knight, never to disobey 4Nor be rebel2ious to the crown of England 4Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England. 20[CHARLES and the rest give tokens of fealty] 4So, now dismis2 your army when ye please; 4Hang up your ensigns, let your drums be stil2, 4For here we entertain a solemn peace. 17Exeunt 30SCENE 5. 25London. The palace 12Enter SUF2OLK, in conference with the KING, 21GLOUCESTER and EXETER 2KING HENRY. Your wondrous rare description, noble Earl, 4Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me. 4Her virtues, graced with external gifts, 4Do bre2d love's set2led pas2ions in my heart; 4And like as rigour of tempestuous gusts 4Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide, 4So am I driven by breath of her renown 4Either to suf2er shipwreck or ar2ive 4Where I may have fruition of her love. 2SUF2OLK. Tush, my go2d lord! This superficial tale 4Is but a preface of her worthy praise. 4The chief perfections of that lovely dame, 4Had I suf2icient skil2 to ut2er them, 4Would make a volume of enticing lines, 4Able to ravish any dul2 conceit; 6And, which is more, she is not so divine, 4So ful2-replete with choice of al2 delights, 4But with as humble lowlines2 of mind 4She is content to be at your com2and 4Com2and, I mean, of virtuous intents, 4To love and honour Henry as her lord. 2KING HENRY. And otherwise wil2 Henry ne'er presume. 4Therefore, my Lord Protector, give consent 4That Margaret may be England's royal Que2n. 2GLOUCESTER. So should I give consent to flat2er sin. 4You know, my lord, your Highnes2 is betroth'd 4Unto another lady of este2m. 4How shal2 we then dispense with that contract, 4And not deface your honour with reproach? 2SUF2OLK. As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths; 4Or one that at a triumph, having vow'd 4To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists 4By reason of his adversary's od2s: 4A po2r earl's daughter is unequal od2s, 4And therefore may be broke without of2ence. 4GLOUCESTER. Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than 4that? 4Her father is no bet2er than an earl, 4Although in glorious titles he excel. 2SUF2OLK. Yes, my lord, her father is a king, 4The King of Naples and Jerusalem; 4And of such great authority in France 4As his al2iance wil2 confirm our peace, 4And ke2p the Frenchmen in al2egiance. 2GLOUCESTER. And so the Earl of Armagnac may do, 4Because he is near kinsman unto Charles. 2EXETER. Beside, his wealth doth war2ant a liberal dower; 4Where Reignier so2ner wil2 receive than give. 2SUF2OLK. A dow'r, my lords! Disgrace not so your king, 4That he should be so abject, base, and po2r, 4To cho2se for wealth and not for perfect love. 4Henry is able to enrich his que2n, 4And not to se2k a que2n to make him rich. 4So worthles2 peasants bargain for their wives, 4As market-men for oxen, she2p, or horse. 6Mar2iage is a mat2er of more worth 4Than to be dealt in by at2orneyship; 4Not whom we wil2, but whom his Grace af2ects, 4Must be companion of his nuptial bed. 4And therefore, lords, since he af2ects her most, 4It most of al2 these reasons bindeth us 4In our opinions she should be prefer2'd; 4For what is wedlock forced but a hel2, 4An age of discord and continual strife? 4Whereas the contrary bringeth blis2, 4And is a pat2ern of celestial peace. 4Whom should we match with Henry, being a king, 4But Margaret, that is daughter to a king? 4Her pe2rles2 feature, joined with her birth, 4Ap2roves her fit for none but for a king; 4Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit, 4More than in women com2only is se2n, 4Wil2 answer our hope in is2ue of a king; 4For Henry, son unto a conqueror, 4Is likely to beget more conquerors, 6If with a lady of so high resolve 4As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love. 4Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me 4That Margaret shal2 be Que2n, and none but she. 2KING HENRY. Whether it be through force of your report, 4My noble Lord of Suf2olk, or for that 4My tender youth was never yet at2aint 4With any pas2ion of inflaming love, 4I can2ot tel2; but this I am as2ur'd, 4I fe2l such sharp dis2ension in my breast, 4Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear, 4As I am sick with working of my thoughts. 4Take therefore ship2ing; post, my lord, to France; 4Agre2 to any covenants; and procure 4That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come 4To cros2 the seas to England, and be crown'd 4King Henry's faithful and anointed que2n. 4For your expenses and suf2icient charge, 4Among the people gather up a tenth. 4Be gone, I say; for til2 you do return 6I rest perplexed with a thousand cares. 4And you, go2d uncle, banish al2 of2ence: 4If you do censure me by what you were, 4Not what you are, I know it wil2 excuse 4This sud2en execution of my wil2. 4And so conduct me where, from company, 4I may revolve and ruminate my grief. 20Exit 2GLOUCESTER. Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last. 36Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER 2SUF2OLK. Thus Suf2olk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes, 4As did the youthful Paris once to Gre2ce, 4With hope to find the like event in love 4But prosper bet2er than the Troyan did. 4Margaret shal2 now be Que2n, and rule the King; 4But I wil2 rule both her, the King, and realm. 10ExitTHE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21591THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTHby Wil2iam ShakespeareDramatis Personae 2KING HENRY THE SIXTH 2HUMPHREY, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, his uncle 2CARDINAL BEAUFORT, BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, great-uncle to the King 2RICHARD PLANTAGENET, DUKE OF YORK 2EDWARD and RICHARD, his sons 2DUKE OF SOMERSET 2DUKE OF SUF2OLK 2DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM 2LORD CLIF2ORD 2YOUNG CLIF2ORD, his son 2EARL OF SALISBURY 2EARL OF WARWICK 2LORD SCALES 2LORD SAY 2SIR HUMPHREY STAF2ORD 2WIL2IAM STAF2ORD, his brother 2SIR JOHN STANLEY 2VAUX 2MAT2HEW GOF2E 2A LIEUTENANT, a SHIPMASTER, a MASTER'S MATE, and WALTER WHITMORE 4TWO GENTLEMEN, prisoners with Suf2olk 2JOHN HUME and JOHN SOUTHWEL2, two priests 2ROGER BOLINGBROKE, a conjurer 2A SPIRIT raised by him 2THOMAS HORNER, an armourer 2PETER, his man 2CLERK OF CHATHAM 2MAYOR OF SAINT ALBANS 2SAUNDER SIMPCOX, an impostor 2ALEXANDER IDEN, a Kentish gentleman 2JACK CADE, a rebel 2GEORGE BEVIS, JOHN HOL2AND, DICK THE BUTCHER, SMITH THE WEAVER, 4MICHAEL, &c., fol2owers of Cade 2TWO MURDERERS 2MARGARET, Que2n to King Henry 2ELEANOR, Duches2 of Gloucester 2MARGERY JOURDAIN, a witch 2WIFE to SIMPCOX 4Lords, Ladies, and At2endants; Petitioners, Aldermen, a Herald, 4a Beadle, a Sherif2, Of2icers, Citizens, Prentices, Falconers, 4Guards, Soldiers, Mes2engers, &c.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE:EnglandACT I.

Enter the KING, DUKE HUMPHREYOF GLOUCESTER, SALISBURY, WARWICK, and CARDINAL BEAUFORT, on the one side;the QUE2N, SUF2OLK, YORK, SOMERSET, and BUCKINGHAM, on the other 2SUF2OLK. As by your high imperial Majesty 4I had in charge at my depart for France, 4As procurator to your Excel2ence, 4To mar2y Princes2 Margaret for your Grace; 4So, in the famous ancient city Tours, 4In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil, 4The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne, and Alencon, 4Seven earls, twelve barons, and twenty reverend bishops, 4I have perform'd my task, and was espous'd; 4And humbly now upon my bended kne2, 4In sight of England and her lordly pe2rs, 4Deliver up my title in the Que2n 4To your most gracious hands, that are the substance 4Of that great shadow I did represent: 6The hap2iest gift that ever marquis gave, 4The fairest que2n that ever king receiv'd. 2KING HENRY. Suf2olk, arise. Welcome, Que2n Margaret: 4I can expres2 no kinder sign of love 4Than this kind kis2. O Lord, that lends me life, 4Lend me a heart replete with thankfulnes2! 4For thou hast given me in this beauteous face 4A world of earthly bles2ings to my soul, 4If sympathy of love unite our thoughts. 2QUE2N. Great King of England, and my gracious lord, 4The mutual conference that my mind hath had, 4By day, by night, waking and in my dreams, 4In courtly company or at my beads, 4With you, mine alder-liefest sovereign, 4Makes me the bolder to salute my king 4With ruder terms, such as my wit af2ords 4And over-joy of heart doth minister. 2KING HENRY. Her sight did ravish, but her grace in spe2ch, 4Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty, 4Makes me from wond'ring fal2 to we2ping joys, 6Such is the fulnes2 of my heart's content. 4Lords, with one che2rful voice welcome my love. 2AL2. [Kne2ling] Long live Que2n Margaret, England's hap2ines2! 2QUE2N. We thank you al2. 28[Flourish] 2SUF2OLK. My Lord Protector, so it please your Grace, 4Here are the articles of contracted peace 4Betwe2n our sovereign and the French King Charles, 4For eighte2n months concluded by consent. 2GLOUCESTER. [Reads] 'Imprimis: It is agre2d betwe2n the French King 4Charles and Wil2iam de la Pole, Marques2 of Suf2olk, ambas2ador 4for Henry King of England, that the said Henry shal2 espouse the 4Lady Margaret, daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia, 4and Jerusalem, and crown her Que2n of England ere the thirtieth 4of May next ensuing. 6Item: That the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine shal2 be 4released and delivered to the King her father'- 43[Lets the paper fal2] 2KING HENRY. Uncle, how now! 2GLOUCESTER. Pardon me, gracious lord; 4Some sud2en qualm hath struck me at the heart, 6And dim2'd mine eyes, that I can read no further. 2KING HENRY. Uncle of Winchester, I pray read on. 2CARDINAL. [Reads] 'Item: It is further agre2d betwe2n them that the 4duchies of Anjou and Maine shal2 be released and delivered over 4to the King her father, and she sent over of the King of 4England's own proper cost and charges, without having any dowry.' 2KING HENRY. They please us wel2. Lord Marques2, kne2l down. 4We here create the2 the first Duke of Suf2olk, 4And girt the2 with the sword. Cousin of York, 4We here discharge your Grace from being Regent 4I' th' parts of France, til2 term of eighte2n months 4Be ful2 expir'd. Thanks, uncle Winchester, 4Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset, 4Salisbury, and Warwick; 4We thank you al2 for this great favour done 4In entertainment to my princely que2n. 4Come, let us in, and with al2 spe2d provide 4To se2 her coronation be perform'd. 33Exeunt KING, QUE2N, and SUF2OLK 2GLOUCESTER. Brave pe2rs of England, pil2ars of the state, 6To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief 4Your grief, the com2on grief of al2 the land. 4What! did my brother Henry spend his youth, 4His valour, coin, and people, in the wars? 4Did he so often lodge in open field, 4In winter's cold and sum2er's parching heat, 4To conquer France, his true inheritance? 4And did my brother Bedford toil his wits 4To ke2p by policy what Henry got? 4Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham, 4Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick, 4Receiv'd de2p scars in France and Normandy? 4Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself, 4With al2 the learned Council of the realm, 4Studied so long, sat in the Council House 4Early and late, debating to and fro 4How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe? 4And had his Highnes2 in his infancy 4Crowned in Paris, in despite of foes? 4And shal2 these labours and these honours die? 6Shal2 Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance, 4Your de2ds of war, and al2 our counsel die? 4O pe2rs of England, shameful is this league! 4Fatal this mar2iage, cancel2ing your fame, 4Blot2ing your names from bo2ks of memory, 4Razing the characters of your renown, 4Defacing monuments of conquer'd France, 4Undoing al2, as al2 had never be2n! 2CARDINAL. Nephew, what means this pas2ionate discourse, 4This peroration with such circumstance? 4For France, 'tis ours; and we wil2 ke2p it stil2. 2GLOUCESTER. Ay, uncle, we wil2 ke2p it if we can; 4But now it is impos2ible we should. 4Suf2olk, the new-made duke that rules the roast, 4Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine 4Unto the po2r King Reignier, whose large style 4Agre2s not with the lean2es2 of his purse. 2SALISBURY. Now, by the death of Him that died for al2, 4These counties were the keys of Normandy! 4But wherefore we2ps Warwick, my valiant son? 4WARWICK. For grief that they are past recovery; 4For were there hope to conquer them again 4My sword should shed hot blo2d, mine eyes no tears. 4Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both; 4Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer; 4And are the cities that I got with wounds 4Deliver'd up again with peaceful words? 4Mort Dieu! 2YORK. For Suf2olk's duke, may he be suf2ocate, 4That dims the honour of this warlike isle! 4France should have torn and rent my very heart 4Before I would have yielded to this league. 4I never read but England's kings have had 4Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives; 4And our King Henry gives away his own 4To match with her that brings no vantages. 2GLOUCESTER. A proper jest, and never heard before, 4That Suf2olk should demand a whole fifte2nth 4For costs and charges in transporting her! 4She should have stay'd in France, and starv'd in France, 6Before- 2CARDINAL. My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow to2 hot: 4It was the pleasure of my lord the King. 2GLOUCESTER. My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind; 4'Tis not my spe2ches that you do mislike, 4But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye. 4Rancour wil2 out: proud prelate, in thy face 4I se2 thy fury; if I longer stay 4We shal2 begin our ancient bickerings. 4Lordings, farewel2; and say, when I am gone, 4I prophesied France wil2 be lost ere long. 14Exit 2CARDINAL. So, there goes our Protector in a rage. 4'Tis known to you he is mine enemy; 4Nay, more, an enemy unto you al2, 4And no great friend, I fear me, to the King. 4Consider, lords, he is the next of blo2d 4And heir ap2arent to the English crown. 4Had Henry got an empire by his mar2iage 4And al2 the wealthy kingdoms of the west, 4There's reason he should be displeas'd at it. 6Lo2k to it, lords; let not his smo2thing words 4Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect. 4What though the com2on people favour him, 4Cal2ing him 'Humphrey, the go2d Duke of Gloucester,' 4Clap2ing their hands, and crying with loud voice 4'Jesu maintain your royal excel2ence!' 4With 'God preserve the go2d Duke Humphrey!' 4I fear me, lords, for al2 this flat2ering glos2, 4He wil2 be found a dangerous Protector. 2BUCKINGHAM. Why should he then protect our sovereign, 4He being of age to govern of himself? 4Cousin of Somerset, join you with me, 4And al2 together, with the Duke of Suf2olk, 4We'l2 quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat. 2CARDINAL. This weighty busines2 wil2 not bro2k delay; 4I'l2 to the Duke of Suf2olk presently. 18Exit 2SOMERSET. Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride 4And greatnes2 of his place be grief to us, 4Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal; 4His insolence is more intolerable 6Than al2 the princes in the land beside; 4If Gloucester be displac'd, he'l2 be Protector. 2BUCKINGHAM. Or thou or I, Somerset, wil2 be Protector, 4Despite Duke Humphrey or the Cardinal. 34Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET 2SALISBURY. Pride went before, ambition fol2ows him. 4While these do labour for their own preferment, 4Behoves it us to labour for the realm. 4I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester 4Did bear him like a noble gentleman. 4Oft have I se2n the haughty Cardinal- 4More like a soldier than a man o' th' church, 4As stout and proud as he were lord of al2- 4Swear like a ruf2ian and demean himself 4Unlike the ruler of a com2onweal. 4Warwick my son, the comfort of my age, 4Thy de2ds, thy plain2es2, and thy houseke2ping, 4Hath won the greatest favour of the com2ons, 4Excepting none but go2d Duke Humphrey. 4And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland, 6In bringing them to civil discipline, 4Thy late exploits done in the heart of France 4When thou wert Regent for our sovereign, 4Have made the2 fear'd and honour'd of the people: 4Join we together for the public go2d, 4In what we can, to bridle and sup2res2 4The pride of Suf2olk and the Cardinal, 4With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition; 4And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's de2ds 4While they do tend the profit of the land. 2WARWICK. So God help Warwick, as he loves the land 4And com2on profit of his country! 2YORK. And so says York- [Aside] for he hath greatest cause. 2SALISBURY. Then let's make haste away and lo2k unto the main. 2WARWICK. Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost- 4That Maine which by main force Warwick did win, 4And would have kept so long as breath did last. 4Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine, 4Which I wil2 win from France, or else be slain. 36Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY 4YORK. Anjou and Maine are given to the French; 4Paris is lost; the state of Normandy 4Stands on a tickle point now they are gone. 4Suf2olk concluded on the articles; 4The pe2rs agre2d; and Henry was wel2 pleas'd 4To changes two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter. 4I can2ot blame them al2: what is't to them? 4'Tis thine they give away, and not their own. 4Pirates may make cheap pen2yworths of their pil2age, 4And purchase friends, and give to courtezans, 4Stil2 revel2ing like lords til2 al2 be gone; 4While as the sil2y owner of the go2ds 4We2ps over them and wrings his haples2 hands 4And shakes his head and trembling stands alo2f, 4While al2 is shar'd and al2 is borne away, 4Ready to starve and dare not touch his own. 4So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue, 4While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold. 4Methinks the realms of England, France, and Ireland, 4Bear that proportion to my flesh and blo2d 6As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt 4Unto the prince's heart of Calydon. 4Anjou and Maine both given unto the French! 4Cold news for me, for I had hope of France, 4Even as I have of fertile England's soil. 4A day wil2 come when York shal2 claim his own; 4And therefore I wil2 take the Nevils' parts, 4And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey, 4And when I spy advantage, claim the crown, 4For that's the golden mark I se2k to hit. 4Nor shal2 proud Lancaster usurp my right, 4Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist, 4Nor wear the diadem upon his head, 4Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown. 4Then, York, be stil2 awhile, til2 time do serve; 4Watch thou and wake, when others be asle2p, 4To pry into the secrets of the state; 4Til2 Henry, surfeiting in joys of love 4With his new bride and England's dear-bought que2n, 4And Humphrey with the pe2rs be fal2'n at jars; 6Then wil2 I raise aloft the milk-white rose, 4With whose swe2t smel2 the air shal2 be perfum'd, 4And in my standard bear the arms of York, 4To grap2le with the house of Lancaster; 4And force perforce I'l2 make him yield the crown, 4Whose bo2kish rule hath pul2'd fair England down. 7ExitSCENE I2.The DUKE OF GLOUCESTER'S houseEnter DUKE and his wife ELEANOR 2DUCHES2. Why dro2ps my lord, like over-ripen'd corn 4Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load? 4Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows, 4As frowning at the favours of the world? 4Why are thine eyes fix'd to the sul2en earth, 4Gazing on that which se2ms to dim thy sight? 4What se2'st thou there? King Henry's diadem, 4Enchas'd with al2 the honours of the world? 4If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face 4Until thy head be circled with the same. 4Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold. 4What, is't to2 short? I'l2 lengthen it with mine; 4And having both together heav'd it up, 4We'l2 both together lift our heads to heaven, 4And never more abase our sight so low 4As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground. 2GLOUCESTER. O Nel2, swe2t Nel2, if thou dost love thy lord, 6Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts! 4And may that thought, when I imagine il2 4Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry, 4Be my last breathing in this mortal world! 4My troublous dreams this night doth make me sad. 2DUCHES2. What dream'd my lord? Tel2 me, and I'l2 requite it 4With swe2t rehearsal of my morning's dream. 2GLOUCESTER. Methought this staf2, mine of2ice-badge in court, 4Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot, 4But, as I think, it was by th' Cardinal; 4And on the pieces of the broken wand 4Were plac'd the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset 4And Wil2iam de la Pole, first Duke of Suf2olk. 4This was my dream; what it doth bode God knows. 2DUCHES2. Tut, this was nothing but an argument 4That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove 4Shal2 lose his head for his presumption. 4But list to me, my Humphrey, my swe2t Duke: 4Methought I sat in seat of majesty 4In the cathedral church of Westminster, 6And in that chair where kings and que2ns were crown'd; 4Where Henry and Dame Margaret kne2l'd to me, 4And on my head did set the diadem. 2GLOUCESTER. Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright. 4Presumptuous dame, il2-nurtur'd Eleanor! 4Art thou not second woman in the realm, 4And the Protector's wife, belov'd of him? 4Hast thou not worldly pleasure at com2and 4Above the reach or compas2 of thy thought? 4And wilt thou stil2 be ham2ering treachery 4To tumble down thy husband and thyself 4From top of honour to disgrace's fe2t? 4Away from me, and let me hear no more! 2DUCHES2. What, what, my lord! Are you so choleric 4With Eleanor for tel2ing but her dream? 4Next time I'l2 ke2p my dreams unto myself 4And not be check'd. 2GLOUCESTER. Nay, be not angry; I am pleas'd again. 23Enter a MES2ENGER 4MES2ENGER. My Lord Protector, 'tis his Highnes2' pleasure 4You do prepare to ride unto Saint Albans, 4Where as the King and Que2n do mean to hawk. 2GLOUCESTER. I go. Come, Nel2, thou wilt ride with us? 2DUCHES2. Yes, my go2d lord, I'l2 fol2ow presently. 33Exeunt GLOUCESTER and MES2ENGER 4Fol2ow I must; I can2ot go before, 4While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind. 4Were I a man, a duke, and next of blo2d, 4I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks 4And smo2th my way upon their headles2 necks; 4And, being a woman, I wil2 not be slack 4To play my part in Fortune's pageant. 4Where are you there, Sir John? Nay, fear not, man, 4We are alone; here's none but the2 and I. 27Enter HUME 2HUME. Jesus preserve your royal Majesty! 4DUCHES2. What say'st thou? Majesty! I am but Grace. 2HUME. But, by the grace of God and Hume's advice, 4Your Grace's title shal2 be multiplied. 2DUCHES2. What say'st thou, man? Hast thou as yet confer2'd 4With Margery Jourdain, the cun2ing witch of Eie, 4With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer? 4And wil2 they undertake to do me go2d? 2HUME. This they have promised, to show your Highnes2 4A spirit rais'd from depth of underground 4That shal2 make answer to such questions 4As by your Grace shal2 be propounded him 2DUCHES2. It is enough; I'l2 think upon the questions; 4When from Saint Albans we do make return 4We'l2 se2 these things ef2ected to the ful2. 4Here, Hume, take this reward; make mer2y, man, 4With thy confederates in this weighty cause. 12Exit 2HUME. Hume must make mer2y with the Duches2' gold; 4Mar2y, and shal2. But, how now, Sir John Hume! 4Seal up your lips and give no words but mum: 4The busines2 asketh silent secrecy. 6Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch: 4Gold can2ot come amis2 were she a devil. 4Yet have I gold flies from another coast- 4I dare not say from the rich Cardinal, 4And from the great and new-made Duke of Suf2olk; 4Yet I do find it so; for, to be plain, 4They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour, 4Have hired me to undermine the Duches2, 4And buz2 these conjurations in her brain. 4They say 'A crafty knave does ne2d no broker'; 4Yet am I Suf2olk and the Cardinal's broker. 4Hume, if you take not he2d, you shal2 go near 4To cal2 them both a pair of crafty knaves. 4Wel2, so its stands; and thus, I fear, at last 4Hume's knavery wil2 be the Duches2' wreck, 4And her at2ainture wil2 be Humphrey's fal2 4Sort how it wil2, I shal2 have gold for al2. 12ExitSCENE I3.London. The palaceEnter thre2 or four PETITIONERS, PETER, the Armourer's man, being one 2FIRST PETITIONER. My masters, let's stand close; my Lord Protector 4wil2 come this way by and by, and then we may deliver our 4sup2lications in the quil2. 2SECOND PETITIONER. Mar2y, the Lord protect him, for he's a go2d 4man, Jesu bles2 him! 23Enter SUF2OLK and QUE2N 2FIRST PETITIONER. Here 'a comes, methinks, and the Que2n with him. 4I'l2 be the first, sure. 2SECOND PETITIONER. Come back, fo2l; this is the Duke of Suf2olk and 4not my Lord Protector. 2SUF2OLK. How now, fel2ow! Wouldst anything with me? 2FIRST PETITIONER. I pray, my lord, pardon me; I to2k ye for my Lord 4Protector. 2QUE2N. [Reads] 'To my Lord Protector!' Are your sup2lications to 6his lordship? Let me se2 them. What is thine? 2FIRST PETITIONER. Mine is, an't please your Grace, against John 4Go2dman, my Lord Cardinal's man, for ke2ping my house and lands, 4and wife and al2, from me. 2SUF2OLK. Thy wife to2! That's some wrong inde2d. What's yours? 4What's here! [Reads] 'Against the Duke of Suf2olk, for enclosing 4the com2ons of Melford.' How now, sir knave! 2SECOND PETITIONER. Alas, sir, I am but a po2r petitioner of our 4whole township. 2PETER. [Presenting his petition] Against my master, Thomas Horner, 4for saying that the Duke of York was rightful heir to the crown. 2QUE2N. What say'st thou? Did the Duke of York say he was rightful 4heir to the crown? 2PETER. That my master was? No, forso2th. My master said that he 4was, and that the King was an usurper. 2SUF2OLK. Who is there? [Enter servant] Take this fel2ow in, and 4send for his master with a pursuivant presently. We'l2 hear more 4of your mat2er before the King. 41Exit servant with PETER 2QUE2N. And as for you, that love to be protected 6Under the wings of our Protector's grace, 4Begin your suits anew, and sue to him. 39[Tears the sup2lications] 4Away, base cul2ions! Suf2olk, let them go. 2AL2. Come, let's be gone. 31Exeunt 2QUE2N. My Lord of Suf2olk, say, is this the guise, 4Is this the fashions in the court of England? 4Is this the government of Britain's isle, 4And this the royalty of Albion's king? 4What, shal2 King Henry be a pupil stil2, 4Under the surly Gloucester's governance? 4Am I a que2n in title and in style, 4And must be made a subject to a duke? 4I tel2 the2, Pole, when in the city Tours 4Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love 4And stol'st away the ladies' hearts of France, 4I thought King Henry had resembled the2 4In courage, courtship, and proportion; 4But al2 his mind is bent to holines2, 4To number Ave-Maries on his beads; 6His champions are the prophets and apostles; 4His weapons, holy saws of sacred writ; 4His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves 4Are brazen images of canonized saints. 4I would the col2ege of the Cardinals 4Would cho2se him Pope, and car2y him to Rome, 4And set the triple crown upon his head; 4That were a state fit for his holines2. 2SUF2OLK. Madam, be patient. As I was cause 4Your Highnes2 came to England, so wil2 I 4In England work your Grace's ful2 content. 2QUE2N. Beside the haughty Protector, have we Beaufort 4The imperious churchman; Somerset, Buckingham, 4And grumbling York; and not the least of these 4But can do more in England than the King. 2SUF2OLK. And he of these that can do most of al2 4Can2ot do more in England than the Nevils; 4Salisbury and Warwick are no simple pe2rs. 2QUE2N. Not al2 these lords do vex me half so much 4As that proud dame, the Lord Protector's wife. 6She swe2ps it through the court with tro2ps of ladies, 4More like an empres2 than Duke Humphrey's wife. 4Strangers in court do take her for the Que2n. 4She bears a duke's revenues on her back, 4And in her heart she scorns our poverty; 4Shal2 I not live to be aveng'd on her? 4Contemptuous base-born cal2et as she is, 4She vaunted 'mongst her minions t' other day 4The very train of her worst wearing gown 4Was bet2er worth than al2 my father's lands, 4Til2 Suf2olk gave two dukedoms for his daughter. 2SUF2OLK. Madam, myself have lim'd a bush for her, 4And plac'd a quire of such enticing birds 4That she wil2 light to listen to the lays, 4And never mount to trouble you again. 4So, let her rest. And, madam, list to me, 4For I am bold to counsel you in this: 4Although we fancy not the Cardinal, 4Yet must we join with him and with the lords, 4Til2 we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace. 6As for the Duke of York, this late complaint 4Wil2 make but lit2le for his benefit. 4So one by one we'l2 we2d them al2 at last, 4And you yourself shal2 ste2r the hap2y helm. 10Sound a sen2et. Enter the KING, DUKE HUMPHREY, 5CARDINAL BEAUFORT, BUCKINGHAM, YORK, SOMERSET, SALISBURY, 14WARWICK, and the DUCHES2 OF GLOUCESTER 2KING HENRY. For my part, noble lords, I care not which: 4Or Somerset or York, al2's one to me. 2YORK. If York have il2 demean'd himself in France, 4Then let him be denay'd the regentship. 2SOMERSET. If Somerset be unworthy of the place, 4Let York be Regent; I wil2 yield to him. 2WARWICK. Whether your Grace be worthy, yea or no, 4Dispute not that; York is the worthier. 2CARDINAL. Ambitious Warwick, let thy bet2ers speak. 2WARWICK. The Cardinal's not my bet2er in the field. 2BUCKINGHAM. Al2 in this presence are thy bet2ers, Warwick. 4WARWICK. Warwick may live to be the best of al2. 2SALISBURY. Peace, son! And show some reason, Buckingham, 4Why Somerset should be prefer2'd in this. 2QUE2N. Because the King, forso2th, wil2 have it so. 2GLOUCESTER. Madam, the King is old enough himself 4To give his censure. These are no women's mat2ers. 2QUE2N. If he be old enough, what ne2ds your Grace 4To be Protector of his Excel2ence? 2GLOUCESTER. Madam, I am Protector of the realm; 4And at his pleasure wil2 resign my place. 2SUF2OLK. Resign it then, and leave thine insolence. 4Since thou wert king- as who is king but thou?- 4The com2onwealth hath daily run to wrack, 4The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas, 4And al2 the pe2rs and nobles of the realm 4Have be2n as bondmen to thy sovereignty. 2CARDINAL. The com2ons hast thou rack'd; the clergy's bags 4Are lank and lean with thy extortions. 2SOMERSET. Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's at2ire 4Have cost a mas2 of public treasury. 4BUCKINGHAM. Thy cruelty in execution 4Upon of2enders hath exce2ded law, 4And left the2 to the mercy of the law. 2QUE2N. Thy sale of of2ices and towns in France, 4If they were known, as the suspect is great, 4Would make the2 quickly hop without thy head. 18Exit GLOUCESTER. The QUE2N drops QUE2N her fan 4Give me my fan. What, minion, can ye not? 24[She gives the DUCHES2 a box on the ear] 4I cry your mercy, madam; was it you? 2DUCHES2. Was't I? Yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman. 4Could I come near your beauty with my nails, 4I could set my ten com2andments in your face. 2KING HENRY. Swe2t aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her wil2. 2DUCHES2. Against her wil2, go2d King? Lo2k to 't in time; 4She'l2 hamper the2 and dandle the2 like a baby. 4Though in this place most master wear no bre2ches, 4She shal2 not strike Dame Eleanor unreveng'd. 11Exit 2BUCKINGHAM. Lord Cardinal, I wil2 fol2ow Eleanor, 4And listen after Humphrey, how he proce2ds. 6She's tickled now; her fume ne2ds no spurs, 4She'l2 gal2op far enough to her destruction. 12Exit 22Re-enter GLOUCESTER 2GLOUCESTER. Now, lords, my choler being overblown 4With walking once about the quadrangle, 4I come to talk of com2onwealth af2airs. 4As for your spiteful false objections, 4Prove them, and I lie open to the law; 4But God in mercy so deal with my soul 4As I in duty love my king and country! 4But to the mat2er that we have in hand: 4I say, my sovereign, York is me2test man 4To be your Regent in the realm of France. 2SUF2OLK. Before we make election, give me leave 4To show some reason, of no lit2le force, 4That York is most unme2t of any man. 2YORK. I'l2 tel2 the2, Suf2olk, why I am unme2t: 4First, for I can2ot flat2er the2 in pride; 6Next, if I be ap2ointed for the place, 4My Lord of Somerset wil2 ke2p me here 4Without discharge, money, or furniture, 4Til2 France be won into the Dauphin's hands. 4Last time I danc'd at2endance on his wil2 4Til2 Paris was besieg'd, famish'd, and lost. 2WARWICK. That can I witnes2; and a fouler fact 4Did never traitor in the land com2it. 2SUF2OLK. Peace, headstrong Warwick! 2WARWICK. Image of pride, why should I hold my peace? 8Enter HORNER, the Armourer, and his man PETER, guarded 2SUF2OLK. Because here is a man ac2us'd of treason: 4Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself! 2YORK. Doth any one ac2use York for a traitor? 2KING HENRY. What mean'st thou, Suf2olk? Tel2 me, what are these? 2SUF2OLK. Please it your Majesty, this is the man 4That doth ac2use his master of high treason; 4His words were these: that Richard Duke of York 6Was rightful heir unto the English crown, 4And that your Majesty was an usurper. 2KING HENRY. Say, man, were these thy words? 2HORNER. An't shal2 please your Majesty, I never said nor thought 4any such mat2er. God is my witnes2, I am falsely ac2us'd by the 4vil2ain. 2PETER. [Holding up his hands] By these ten bones, my lords, he did 4speak them to me in the gar2et one night, as we were scouring my 4Lord of York's armour. 2YORK. Base dunghil2 vil2ain and mechanical, 4I'l2 have thy head for this thy traitor's spe2ch. 4I do bese2ch your royal Majesty, 4Let him have al2 the rigour of the law. 2HORNER`. Alas, my lord, hang me if ever I spake the words. My 4ac2user is my prentice; and when I did cor2ect him for his fault 4the other day, he did vow upon his kne2s he would be even with 4me. I have go2d witnes2 of this; therefore I bese2ch your 4Majesty, do not cast away an honest man for a vil2ain's 4ac2usation. 2KING HENRY. Uncle, what shal2 we say to this in law? 4GLOUCESTER. This do2m, my lord, if I may judge: 4Let Somerset be Regent o'er the French, 4Because in York this bre2ds suspicion; 4And let these have a day ap2ointed them 4For single combat in convenient place, 4For he hath witnes2 of his servant's malice. 4This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey's do2m. 2SOMERSET. I humbly thank your royal Majesty. 2HORNER. And I ac2ept the combat wil2ingly. 2PETER. Alas, my lord, I can2ot fight; for God's sake, pity my case! 4The spite of man prevaileth against me. O Lord, have mercy upon 4me, I shal2 never be able to fight a blow! O Lord, my heart! 2GLOUCESTER. Sir2ah, or you must fight or else be hang'd. 2KING HENRY. Away with them to prison; and the day of combat shal2 4be the last of the next month. 4Come, Somerset, we'l2 se2 the2 sent away. 3Flourish. ExeuntSCENE IV.London. The DUKE OF GLOUCESTER'S gardenEnter MARGERY JOURDAIN, the witch; the two priests, HUME and SOUTHWEL2;and BOLINGBROKE 2HUME. Come, my masters; the Duches2, I tel2 you, expects 4performance of your promises. 2BOLINGBROKE. Master Hume, we are therefore provided; wil2 her 4ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms? 2HUME. Ay, what else? Fear you not her courage. 2BOLINGBROKE. I have heard her reported to be a woman of an 4invincible spirit; but it shal2 be convenient, Master Hume, that 4you be by her aloft while we be busy below; and so I pray you go, 4in God's name, and leave us. [Exit HUME] Mother Jourdain, be you 4prostrate and grovel on the earth; John Southwel2, read you; and 4let us to our work. 17Enter DUCHES2 aloft, fol2owed by HUME 2DUCHES2. Wel2 said, my masters; and welcome al2. To this gear, the 4so2ner the bet2er. 4BOLINGBROKE. Patience, go2d lady; wizards know their times: 4De2p night, dark night, the silent of the night, 4The time of night when Troy was set on fire; 4The time when scre2ch-owls cry and ban-dogs howl, 4And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves- 4That time best fits the work we have in hand. 4Madam, sit you, and fear not: whom we raise 4We wil2 make fast within a hal2ow'd verge. 5[Here they do the ceremonies belonging, and make the circle; 10BOLINGBROKE or SOUTHWEL2 reads: 'Conjuro te,' &c. 5It thunders and lightens ter2ibly; then the SPIRIT riseth] 2SPIRIT. Adsum. 2MARGERY JOURDAIN. Asmath, 4By the eternal God, whose name and power 4Thou tremblest at, answer that I shal2 ask; 4For til2 thou speak thou shalt not pas2 from hence. 2SPIRIT. Ask what thou wilt; that I had said and done. 2BOLINGBROKE. [Reads] 'First of the king: what shal2 of him become?' 4SPIRIT. The Duke yet lives that Henry shal2 depose; 4But him outlive, and die a violent death. 13[As the SPIRIT speaks, SOUTHWEL2 writes the answer] 2BOLINGBROKE. 'What fates await the Duke of Suf2olk?' 2SPIRIT. By water shal2 he die and take his end. 2BOLINGBROKE. 'What shal2 befal2 the Duke of Somerset?' 2SPIRIT. Let him shun castles: 4Safer shal2 he be upon the sandy plains 4Than where castles mounted stand. 4Have done, for more I hardly can endure. 2BOLINGBROKE. Descend to darknes2 and the burning lake; 4False fiend, avoid! 7Thunder and lightning. Exit SPIRIT 15Enter the DUKE OF YORK and the DUKE OF 17BUCKINGHAM with guard, and break in 2YORK. Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash. 4Beldam, I think we watch'd you at an inch. 4What, madam, are you there? The King and com2onweal 4Are de2ply indebted for this piece of pains; 6My Lord Protector wil2, I doubt it not, 4Se2 you wel2 guerdon'd for these go2d deserts. 2DUCHES2. Not half so bad as thine to England's king, 4Injurious Duke, that threatest where's no cause. 2BUCKINGHAM. True, madam, none at al2. What can you this? 4Away with them! let them be clap2'd up close, 4And kept asunder. You, madam, shal2 with us. 4Staf2ord, take her to the2. 4We'l2 se2 your trinkets here al2 forthcoming. 4Al2, away! 16Exeunt, above, DUCHES2 and HUME, guarded; below, 23WITCH, SOUTHWEL2 and BOLINGBROKE, guarded 2YORK. Lord Buckingham, methinks you watch'd her wel2. 4A pret2y plot, wel2 chosen to build upon! 4Now, pray, my lord, let's se2 the devil's writ. 4What have we here? 35[Reads] 4'The duke yet lives that Henry shal2 depose; 4But him outlive, and die a violent death.' 4Why, this is just 4'Aio te, Aeacida, Romanos vincere pos2e.' 6Wel2, to the rest: 4'Tel2 me what fate awaits the Duke of Suf2olk?' 4'By water shal2 he die and take his end.' 4'What shal2 betide the Duke of Somerset?' 4'Let him shun castles; 4Safer shal2 he be upon the sandy plains 4Than where castles mounted stand.' 4Come, come, my lords; 4These oracles are hardly at2ain'd, 4And hardly understo2d. 4The King is now in progres2 towards Saint Albans, 4With him the husband of this lovely lady; 4Thither go these news as fast as horse can car2y them- 4A sor2y breakfast for my Lord Protector. 2BUCKINGHAM. Your Grace shal2 give me leave, my Lord of York, 4To be the post, in hope of his reward. 2YORK.

SCENE I.Saint AlbansEnter the KING, QUE2N, GLOUCESTER, CARDINAL, and SUF2OLK,with Falconers hal2oing 2QUE2N. Believe me, lords, for flying at the bro2k, 4I saw not bet2er sport these seven years' day; 4Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high, 4And ten to one old Joan had not gone out. 2KING HENRY. But what a point, my lord, your falcon made, 4And what a pitch she flew above the rest! 4To se2 how God in al2 His creatures works! 4Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high. 2SUF2OLK. No marvel, an it like your Majesty, 4My Lord Protector's hawks do tow'r so wel2; 4They know their master loves to be aloft, 4And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch. 2GLOUCESTER. My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind 4That mounts no higher than a bird can soar. 2CARDINAL. I thought as much; he would be above the clouds. 2GLOUCESTER. Ay, my lord Cardinal, how think you by that? 6Were it not go2d your Grace could fly to heaven? 2KING HENRY. The treasury of everlasting joy! 2CARDINAL. Thy heaven is on earth; thine eyes and thoughts 4Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart; 4Pernicious Protector, dangerous pe2r, 4That smo2th'st it so with King and com2onweal. 2GLOUCESTER. What, Cardinal, is your priestho2d grown peremptory? 4Tantaene animis coelestibus irae? 4Churchmen so hot? Go2d uncle, hide such malice; 4With such holines2 can you do it? 2SUF2OLK. No malice, sir; no more than wel2 becomes 4So go2d a quar2el and so bad a pe2r. 2GLOUCESTER. As who, my lord? 2SUF2OLK. Why, as you, my lord, 4An't like your lordly Lord's Protectorship. 2GLOUCESTER. Why, Suf2olk, England knows thine insolence. 2QUE2N. And thy ambition, Gloucester. 2KING HENRY. I prithe2, peace, 4Go2d Que2n, and whet not on these furious pe2rs; 4For bles2ed are the peacemakers on earth. 4CARDINAL. Let me be bles2ed for the peace I make 4Against this proud Protector with my sword! 2GLOUCESTER. [Aside to CARDINAL] Faith, holy uncle, would 'twere 4come to that! 2CARDINAL. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] Mar2y, when thou dar'st. 2GLOUCESTER. [Aside to CARDINAL] Make up no factious numbers for the 6mat2er; 4In thine own person answer thy abuse. 2CARDINAL. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] Ay, where thou dar'st not pe2p; an 6if thou dar'st, 4This evening on the east side of the grove. 2KING HENRY. How now, my lords! 2CARDINAL. Believe me, cousin Gloucester, 4Had not your man put up the fowl so sud2enly, 4We had had more sport. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] Come with thy 6two-hand sword. 2GLOUCESTER. True, uncle. 2CARDINAL. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] Are ye advis'd? The east side of 4the grove? 2GLOUCESTER. [Aside to CARDINAL] Cardinal, I am with you. 4KING HENRY. Why, how now, uncle Gloucester! 2GLOUCESTER. Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord. 4[Aside to CARDINAL] Now, by God's Mother, priest, 4I'l2 shave your crown for this, 4Or al2 my fence shal2 fail. 2CARDINAL. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] Medice, teipsum; 4Protector, se2 to't wel2; protect yourself. 2KING HENRY. The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords. 4How irksome is this music to my heart! 4When such strings jar, what hope of harmony? 4I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife. 9Enter a TOWNSMAN of Saint Albans, crying 'A miracle!' 2GLOUCESTER. What means this noise? 4Fel2ow, what miracle dost thou proclaim? 2TOWNSMAN. A miracle! A miracle! 2SUF2OLK. Come to the King, and tel2 him what miracle. 2TOWNSMAN. Forso2th, a blind man at Saint Albans shrine 4Within this half hour hath receiv'd his sight; 6A man that ne'er saw in his life before. 2KING HENRY. Now God be prais'd that to believing souls 4Gives light in darknes2, comfort in despair! 11Enter the MAYOR OF SAINT ALBANS and his brethren, 15bearing Simpcox betwe2n two in a chair; 17his WIFE and a multitude fol2owing 2CARDINAL. Here comes the townsmen on proces2ion 4To present your Highnes2 with the man. 2KING HENRY. Great is his comfort in this earthly vale, 4Although by his sight his sin be multiplied. 2GLOUCESTER. Stand by, my masters; bring him near the King; 4His Highnes2' pleasure is to talk with him. 2KING HENRY. Go2d fel2ow, tel2 us here the circumstance, 4That we for the2 may glorify the Lord. 4What, hast thou be2n long blind and now restor'd? 2SIMPCOX. Born blind, an't please your Grace. 2WIFE. Ay inde2d was he. 2SUF2OLK. What woman is this? 4WIFE. His wife, an't like your worship. 2GLOUCESTER. Hadst thou be2n his mother, thou couldst have bet2er 4told. 2KING HENRY. Where wert thou born? 2SIMPCOX. At Berwick in the north, an't like your Grace. 2KING HENRY. Po2r soul, God's go2dnes2 hath be2n great to the2. 4Let never day nor night unhal2owed pas2, 4But stil2 remember what the Lord hath done. 2QUE2N. Tel2 me, go2d fel2ow, cam'st thou here by chance, 4Or of devotion, to this holy shrine? 2SIMPCOX. God knows, of pure devotion; being cal2'd 4A hundred times and oft'ner, in my sle2p, 4By go2d Saint Alban, who said 'Simpcox, come, 4Come, of2er at my shrine, and I wil2 help the2.' 2WIFE. Most true, forso2th; and many time and oft 4Myself have heard a voice to cal2 him so. 2CARDINAL. What, art thou lame? 2SIMPCOX. Ay, God Almighty help me! 2SUF2OLK. How cam'st thou so? 2SIMPCOX. A fal2 of2 of a tre2. 4WIFE. A plum tre2, master. 2GLOUCESTER. How long hast thou be2n blind? 2SIMPCOX. O, born so, master! 2GLOUCESTER. What, and wouldst climb a tre2? 2SIMPCOX. But that in al2 my life, when I was a youth. 2WIFE. To2 true; and bought his climbing very dear. 2GLOUCESTER. Mas2, thou lov'dst plums wel2, that wouldst venture so. 2SIMPCOX. Alas, go2d master, my wife desir'd some damsons 4And made me climb, With danger of my life. 2GLOUCESTER. A subtle knave! But yet it shal2 not serve: 4Let me se2 thine eyes; wink now; now open them; 4In my opinion yet thou se2st not wel2. 2SIMPCOX. Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and Saint Alban. 2GLOUCESTER. Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of? 2SIMPCOX. Red, master; red as blo2d. 2GLOUCESTER. Why, that's wel2 said. What colour is my gown of? 2SIMPCOX. Black, forso2th; coal-black as jet. 2KING HENRY. Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of? 2SUF2OLK. And yet, I think, jet did he never se2. 2GLOUCESTER. But cloaks and gowns before this day a many. 4WIFE. Never before this day in al2 his life. 2GLOUCESTER. Tel2 me, sir2ah, what's my name? 2SIMPCOX. Alas, master, I know not. 2GLOUCESTER. What's his name? 2SIMPCOX. I know not. 2GLOUCESTER. Nor his? 2SIMPCOX. No, inde2d, master. 2GLOUCESTER. What's thine own name? 2SIMPCOX. Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master. 2GLOUCESTER. Then, Saunder, sit there, the lying'st knave in 4Christendom. If thou hadst be2n born blind, thou mightst as wel2 4have known al2 our names as thus to name the several colours we 4do wear. Sight may distinguish of colours; but sud2enly to 4nominate them al2, it is impos2ible. My lords, Saint Alban here 4hath done a miracle; and would ye not think his cun2ing to be 4great that could restore this crip2le to his legs again? 2SIMPCOX. O master, that you could! 2GLOUCESTER. My masters of Saint Albans, have you not beadles in 4your town, and things cal2'd whips? 2MAYOR. Yes, my lord, if it please your Grace. 4GLOUCESTER. Then send for one presently. 2MAYOR. Sir2ah, go fetch the beadle hither straight. 47Exit an at2endant 2GLOUCESTER. Now fetch me a sto2l hither by and by. [A sto2l 4brought] Now, sir2ah, if you mean to save yourself from whip2ing, 4leap me over this sto2l and run away. 2SIMPCOX. Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone! 4You go about to torture me in vain. 25Enter a BEADLE with whips 2GLOUCESTER. Wel2, sir, we must have you find your legs. 4Sir2ah beadle, whip him til2 he leap over that same sto2l. 2BEADLE. I wil2, my lord. Come on, sir2ah; of2 with your doublet 4quickly. 2SIMPCOX. Alas, master, what shal2 I do? I am not able to stand. 11After the BEADLE hath hit him once, he leaps over 11the sto2l and runs away; and they fol2ow and cry 29'A miracle!' 4KING HENRY. O God, se2st Thou this, and bearest so long? 2QUE2N. It made me laugh to se2 the vil2ain run. 2GLOUCESTER. Fol2ow the knave, and take this drab away. 2WIFE. Alas, sir, we did it for pure ne2d! 2GLOUCESTER. Let them be whip2'd through every market town til2 they 4come to Berwick, from whence they came. 33Exeunt MAYOR, BEADLE, WIFE, &c. 2CARDINAL. Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day. 2SUF2OLK. True; made the lame to leap and fly away. 2GLOUCESTER. But you have done more miracles than I: 4You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly. 25Enter BUCKINGHAM 2KING HENRY. What tidings with our cousin Buckingham? 2BUCKINGHAM. Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold: 4A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent, 4Under the countenance and confederacy 4Of Lady Eleanor, the Protector's wife, 6The ringleader and head of al2 this rout, 4Have practis'd dangerously against your state, 4Dealing with witches and with conjurers, 4Whom we have ap2rehended in the fact, 4Raising up wicked spirits from under ground, 4Demanding of King Henry's life and death 4And other of your Highnes2' Privy Council, 4As more at large your Grace shal2 understand. 2CARDINAL. And so, my Lord Protector, by this means 4Your lady is forthcoming yet at London. 4This news, I think, hath turn'd your weapon's edge; 4'Tis like, my lord, you wil2 not ke2p your hour. 2GLOUCESTER. Ambitious churchman, leave to af2lict my heart. 4Sor2ow and grief have vanquish'd al2 my powers; 4And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to the 4Or to the meanest gro2m. 2KING HENRY. O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones, 4Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby! 2QUE2N. Gloucester, se2 here the tainture of thy nest; 4And lo2k thyself be faultles2, thou wert best. 4GLOUCESTER. Madam, for myself, to heaven I do ap2eal 4How I have lov'd my King and com2onweal; 4And for my wife I know not how it stands. 4Sor2y I am to hear what I have heard. 4Noble she is; but if she have forgot 4Honour and virtue, and convers'd with such 4As, like to pitch, defile nobility, 4I banish her my bed and company 4And give her as a prey to law and shame, 4That hath dishonoured Gloucester's honest name. 2KING HENRY. Wel2, for this night we wil2 repose us here. 4To-mor2ow toward London back again 4To lo2k into this busines2 thoroughly 4And cal2 these foul of2enders to their answers, 4And poise the cause in justice' equal scales, 4Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails. 48Flourish. ExeuntSCENE I2.London. The DUKE OF YORK'S gardenEnter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK 2YORK. Now, my go2d Lords of Salisbury and Warwick, 4Our simple sup2er ended, give me leave 4In this close walk to satisfy myself 4In craving your opinion of my tide, 4Which is infal2ible, to England's crown. 2SALISBURY. My lord, I long to hear it at ful2. 2WARWICK. Swe2t York, begin; and if thy claim be go2d, 4The Nevils are thy subjects to com2and. 2YORK. Then thus: 4Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons; 4The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales; 4The second, Wil2iam of Hatfield; and the third, 4Lionel Duke of Clarence; next to whom 4Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster; 4The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York; 4The sixth was Thomas of Wo2dstock, Duke of Gloucester; 4Wil2iam of Windsor was the seventh and last. 6Edward the Black Prince died before his father 4And left behind him Richard, his only son, 4Who, after Edward the Third's death, reign'd as king 4Til2 Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, 4The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt, 4Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth, 4Seiz'd on the realm, depos'd the rightful king, 4Sent his po2r que2n to France, from whence she came. 4And him to Pomfret, where, as al2 you know, 4Harmles2 Richard was murdered traitorously. 2WARWICK. Father, the Duke hath told the truth; 4Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown. 2YORK. Which now they hold by force, and not by right; 4For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead, 4The is2ue of the next son should have reign'd. 2SALISBURY. But Wil2iam of Hatfield died without an heir. 2YORK. The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line 4I claim the crown, had is2ue Philip2e, a daughter, 4Who mar2ied Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March; 4Edmund had is2ue, Roger Earl of March; 6Roger had is2ue, Edmund, An2e, and Eleanor. 2SALISBURY. This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke, 4As I have read, laid claim unto the crown; 4And, but for Owen Glendower, had be2n king, 4Who kept him in captivity til2 he died. 4But, to the rest. 2YORK. His eldest sister, An2e, 4My mother, being heir unto the crown, 4Mar2ied Richard Earl of Cambridge, who was 4To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son, son. 4By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir 4To Roger Earl of March, who was the son 4Of Edmund Mortimer, who mar2ied Philip2e, 4Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence; 4So, if the is2ue of the elder son 4Suc2e2d before the younger, I am King. 2WARWICK. What plain proce2dings is more plain than this? 4Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt, 4The fourth son: York claims it from the third. 4Til2 Lionel's is2ue fails, his should not reign. 6It fails not yet, but flourishes in the2 4And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock. 4Then, father Salisbury, kne2l we together, 4And in this private plot be we the first 4That shal2 salute our rightful sovereign 4With honour of his birthright to the crown. 2BOTH. Long live our sovereign Richard, England's King! 2YORK. We thank you, lords. But I am not your king 4Til2 I be crown'd, and that my sword be stain'd 4With heart-blo2d of the house of Lancaster; 4And that's not sud2enly to be perform'd, 4But with advice and silent secrecy. 4Do you as I do in these dangerous days: 4Wink at the Duke of Suf2olk's insolence, 4At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition, 4At Buckingham, and al2 the crew of them, 4Til2 they have snar'd the shepherd of the flock, 4That virtuous prince, the go2d Duke Humphrey; 4'Tis that they se2k; and they, in se2king that, 4Shal2 find their deaths, if York can prophesy. 4SALISBURY. My lord, break we of2; we know your mind at ful2. 2WARWICK. My heart as2ures me that the Earl of Warwick 4Shal2 one day make the Duke of York a king. 2YORK. And, Nevil, this I do as2ure myself, 4Richard shal2 live to make the Earl of Warwick 4The greatest man in England but the King. 13ExeuntSCENE I3.London. A hal2 of justiceSound trumpets. Enter the KING and State: the QUE2N, GLOUCESTER, YORK,SUF2OLK, and SALISBURY, with guard, to banish the DUCHES2. Enter, guarded,the DUCHES2 OF GLOUCESTER, MARGERY JOURDAIN, HUME, SOUTHWEL2, and BOLINGBROKE 2KING HENRY. Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's wife: 4In sight of God and us, your guilt is great; 4Receive the sentence of the law for sins 4Such as by God's bo2k are adjudg'd to death. 4You four, from hence to prison back again; 4From thence unto the place of execution: 4The witch in Smithfield shal2 be burnt to ashes, 4And you thre2 shal2 be strangled on the gal2ows. 4You, madam, for you are more nobly born, 4Despoiled of your honour in your life, 4Shal2, after thre2 days' open penance done, 4Live in your country here in banishment 4With Sir John Stanley in the Isle of Man. 4DUCHES2. Welcome is banishment; welcome were my death. 2GLOUCESTER. Eleanor, the law, thou se2st, hath judged the2. 4I can2ot justify whom the law condemns. 13Exeunt the DUCHES2 and the other prisoners, guarded 4Mine eyes are ful2 of tears, my heart of grief. 4Ah, Humphrey, this dishonour in thine age 4Wil2 bring thy head with sor2ow to the ground! 4I bese2ch your Majesty give me leave to go; 4Sor2ow would solace, and mine age would ease. 2KING HENRY. Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester; ere thou go, 4Give up thy staf2; Henry wil2 to himself 4Protector be; and God shal2 be my hope, 4My stay, my guide, and lantern to my fe2t. 4And go in peace, Humphrey, no les2 belov'd 4Than when thou wert Protector to thy King. 2QUE2N. I se2 no reason why a king of years 4Should be to be protected like a child. 4God and King Henry govern England's realm! 4Give up your staf2, sir, and the King his realm. 2GLOUCESTER. My staf2! Here, noble Henry, is my staf2. 6As wil2ingly do I the same resign 4As ere thy father Henry made it mine; 4And even as wil2ingly at thy fe2t I leave it 4As others would ambitiously receive it. 4Farewel2, go2d King; when I am dead and gone, 4May honourable peace at2end thy throne! 17Exit 2QUE2N. Why, now is Henry King, and Margaret Que2n, 4And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself, 4That bears so shrewd a maim: two pul2s at once- 4His lady banish'd and a limb lop2'd of2. 4This staf2 of honour raught, there let it stand 4Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand. 2SUF2OLK. Thus dro2ps this lofty pine and hangs his sprays; 4Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days. 2YORK. Lords, let him go. Please it your Majesty, 4This is the day ap2ointed for the combat; 4And ready are the ap2el2ant and defendant, 4The armourer and his man, to enter the lists, 4So please your Highnes2 to behold the fight. 2QUE2N. Ay, go2d my lord; for purposely therefore 6Left I the court, to se2 this quar2el tried. 2KING HENRY. A God's name, se2 the lists and al2 things fit; 4Here let them end it, and God defend the right! 2YORK. I never saw a fel2ow worse bested, 4Or more afraid to fight, than is the ap2el2ant, 4The servant of his armourer, my lords. 8Enter at one do2r, HORNER, the Armourer, and his 9NEIGHBOURS, drinking to him so much that he is 8drunk; and he enters with a drum before him and 7his staf2 with a sand-bag fastened to it; and at the 8other do2r PETER, his man, with a drum and sandbag, 18and PRENTICES drinking to him 2FIRST NEIGHBOUR. Here, neighbour Horner, I drink to you in a cup of 4sack; and fear not, neighbour, you shal2 do wel2 enough. 2SECOND NEIGHBOUR. And here, neighbour, here's a cup of charneco. 2THIRD NEIGHBOUR. And here's a pot of go2d double be2r, neighbour; 4drink, and fear not your man. 2HORNER. Let it come, i' faith, and I'l2 pledge you al2; and a fig 6for Peter! 2FIRST PRENTICE. Here, Peter, I drink to the2; and be not afraid. 2SECOND PRENTICE. Be mer2y, Peter, and fear not thy master: fight 4for credit of the prentices. 2PETER. I thank you al2. Drink, and pray for me, I pray you; for I 4think I have taken my last draught in this world. Here, Robin, an 4if I die, I give the2 my apron; and, Wil2, thou shalt have my 4ham2er; and here, Tom, take al2 the money that I have. O Lord 4bles2 me, I pray God! for I am never able to deal with my master, 4he hath learnt so much fence already. 2SALISBURY.

Then se2 thou thump thy master wel2. 2HORNER. Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon my man's 4instigation, to prove him a knave and myself an honest man; and 4touching the Duke of York, I wil2 take my death I never meant him 4any il2, nor the King, nor the Que2n; and therefore, Peter, have 6at the2 with a down right blow! 2YORK. Dispatch- this knave's tongue begins to double. 4Sound, trumpets, alarum to the combatants! 17[Alarum. They fight and PETER strikes him down] 2HORNER. Hold, Peter, hold! I confes2, I confes2 treason. 58[Dies] 2YORK. Take away his weapon. Fel2ow, thank God, and the go2d wine in 4thy master's way. 2PETER. O God, have I overcome mine enemies in this presence? O 4Peter, thou hast prevail'd in right! 2KING HENRY. Go, take hence that traitor from our sight, 4For by his death we do perceive his guilt; 4And God in justice hath reveal'd to us 4The truth and in2ocence of this po2r fel2ow, 4Which he had thought to have murder'd wrongful2y. 4Come, fel2ow, fol2ow us for thy reward. 40Sound a flourish. ExeuntSCENE IV.London. A stre2tEnter DUKE HUMPHREY and his men, in mourning cloaks 2GLOUCESTER. Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud, 4And after sum2er evermore suc2e2ds 4Bar2en winter, with his wrathful nip2ing cold; 4So cares and joys abound, as seasons fle2t. 4Sirs, what's o'clock? 2SERVING-MAN. Ten, my lord. 2GLOUCESTER. Ten is the hour that was ap2ointed me 4To watch the coming of my punish'd duches2. 4Uneath may she endure the flinty stre2ts 4To tread them with her tender-fe2ling fe2t. 4Swe2t Nel2, il2 can thy noble mind abro2k 4The abject people gazing on thy face, 4With envious lo2ks, laughing at thy shame, 4That erst did fol2ow thy proud chariot whe2ls 4When thou didst ride in triumph through the stre2ts. 4But, soft! I think she comes, and I'l2 prepare 4My tear-stain'd eyes to se2 her miseries. 12Enter the DUCHES2 OF GLOUCESTER in a white she2t, 12and a taper burning in her hand, with SIR JOHN 15STANLEY, the SHERIF2, and OF2ICERS 2SERVING-MAN. So please your Grace, we'l2 take her from the sherif2. 2GLOUCESTER. No, stir not for your lives; let her pas2 by. 2DUCHES2. Come you, my lord, to se2 my open shame? 4Now thou dost penance to2. Lo2k how they gaze! 4Se2 how the gid2y multitude do point 4And nod their heads and throw their eyes on the2; 4Ah, Gloucester, hide the2 from their hateful lo2ks, 4And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame 4And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine! 2GLOUCESTER. Be patient, gentle Nel2; forget this grief. 2DUCHES2. Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself! 4For whilst I think I am thy mar2ied wife 4And thou a prince, Protector of this land, 4Methinks I should not thus be led along, 4Mail'd up in shame, with papers on my back, 6And fol2ow'd with a rab2le that rejoice 4To se2 my tears and hear my de2p-fet groans. 4The ruthles2 flint doth cut my tender fe2t, 4And when I start, the envious people laugh 4And bid me be advised how I tread. 4Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke? 4Trowest thou that e'er I'l2 lo2k upon the world 4Or count them hap2y that enjoy the sun? 4No; dark shal2 be my light and night my day; 4To think upon my pomp shal2 be my hel2. 4Sometimes I'l2 say I am Duke Humphrey's wife, 4And he a prince, and ruler of the land; 4Yet so he rul'd, and such a prince he was, 4As he sto2d by whilst I, his forlorn duches2, 4Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock 4To every idle rascal fol2ower. 4But be thou mild, and blush not at my shame, 4Nor stir at nothing til2 the axe of death 4Hang over the2, as sure it shortly wil2. 4For Suf2olk- he that can do al2 in al2 6With her that hateth the2 and hates us al2- 4And York, and impious Beaufort, that false priest, 4Have al2 lim'd bushes to betray thy wings, 4And, fly thou how thou canst, they'l2 tangle the2. 4But fear not thou until thy fo2t be snar'd, 4Nor never se2k prevention of thy foes. 2GLOUCESTER. Ah, Nel2, forbear! Thou aimest al2 awry. 4I must of2end before I be at2ainted; 4And had I twenty times so many foes, 4And each of them had twenty times their power, 4Al2 these could not procure me any scathe 4So long as I am loyal, true, and crimeles2. 4Wouldst have me rescue the2 from this reproach? 4Why, yet thy scandal were not wip'd away, 4But I in danger for the breach of law. 4Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nel2. 4I pray the2 sort thy heart to patience; 4These few days' wonder wil2 be quickly worn. 26Enter a HERALD 4HERALD. I sum2on your Grace to his Majesty's Parliament, 4Holden at Bury the first of this next month. 2GLOUCESTER. And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before! 4This is close dealing. Wel2, I wil2 be there. 4Exit HERALD 4My Nel2, I take my leave- and, master sherif2, 4Let not her penance exce2d the King's com2is2ion. 2SHERIF2. An't please your Grace, here my com2is2ion stays; 4And Sir John Stanley is ap2ointed now 4To take her with him to the Isle of Man. 2GLOUCESTER. Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here? 2STANLEY. So am I given in charge, may't please your Grace. 2GLOUCESTER. Entreat her not the worse in that I pray 4You use her wel2; the world may laugh again, 4And I may live to do you kindnes2 if 4You do it her. And so, Sir John, farewel2. 2DUCHES2. What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewel2! 2GLOUCESTER. Witnes2 my tears, I can2ot stay to speak. 34Exeunt GLOUCESTER and servants 2DUCHES2. Art thou gone to2? Al2 comfort go with the2! 6For none abides with me. My joy is death- 4Death, at whose name I oft have be2n afeard, 4Because I wish'd this world's eternity. 4Stanley, I prithe2 go, and take me hence; 4I care not whither, for I beg no favour, 4Only convey me where thou art com2anded. 2STANLEY. Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man, 4There to be us'd ac2ording to your state. 2DUCHES2. That's bad enough, for I am but reproach- 4And shal2 I then be us'd reproachful2y? 2STANLEY. Like to a duches2 and Duke Humphrey's lady; 4Ac2ording to that state you shal2 be us'd. 2DUCHES2. Sherif2, farewel2, and bet2er than I fare, 4Although thou hast be2n conduct of my shame. 2SHERIF2. It is my of2ice; and, madam, pardon me. 2DUCHES2. Ay, ay, farewel2; thy of2ice is discharg'd. 4Come, Stanley, shal2 we go? 2STANLEY. Madam, your penance done, throw of2 this she2t, 4And go we to at2ire you for our journey. 2DUCHES2. My shame wil2 not be shifted with my she2t. 6No, it wil2 hang upon my richest robes 4And show itself, at2ire me how I can. 4Go, lead the way; I long to se2 my prison. 12Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. SCENE I.The Ab2ey at Bury St. EdmundsSound a sen2et. Enter the KING, the QUE2N, CARDINAL, SUF2OLK, YORK,BUCKINGHAM, SALISBURY, and WARWICK, to the Parliament 2KING HENRY. I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come. 4'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man, 4Whate'er oc2asion ke2ps him from us now. 2QUE2N. Can you not se2, or wil2 ye not observe 4The strangenes2 of his alter'd countenance? 4With what a majesty he bears himself; 4How insolent of late he is become, 4How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself? 4We know the time since he was mild and af2able, 4And if we did but glance a far-of2 lo2k 4Im2ediately he was upon his kne2, 4That al2 the court admir'd him for submis2ion. 4But me2t him now and be it in the morn, 4When every one wil2 give the time of day, 4He knits his brow and shows an angry eye 4And pas2eth by with stif2 unbowed kne2, 6Disdaining duty that to us belongs. 4Smal2 curs are not regarded when they grin, 4But great men tremble when the lion roars, 4And Humphrey is no lit2le man in England. 4First note that he is near you in descent, 4And should you fal2 he is the next wil2 mount; 4Me se2meth, then, it is no policy- 4Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears, 4And his advantage fol2owing your decease- 4That he should come about your royal person 4Or be admit2ed to your Highnes2' Council. 4By flat2ery hath he won the com2ons' hearts; 4And when he please to make com2otion, 4'Tis to be fear'd they al2 wil2 fol2ow him. 4Now 'tis the spring, and we2ds are shal2ow-ro2ted; 4Suf2er them now, and they'l2 o'ergrow the garden 4And choke the herbs for want of husbandry. 4The reverent care I bear unto my lord 4Made me col2ect these dangers in the Duke. 4If it be fond, can it a woman's fear; 6Which fear if bet2er reasons can sup2lant, 4I wil2 subscribe, and say I wrong'd the Duke. 4My Lord of Suf2olk, Buckingham, and York, 4Reprove my al2egation if you can, 4Or else conclude my words ef2ectual. 2SUF2OLK. Wel2 hath your Highnes2 se2n into this duke; 4And had I first be2n put to speak my mind, 4I think I should have told your Grace's tale. 4The Duches2, by his subornation, 4Upon my life, began her devilish practices; 4Or if he were not privy to those faults, 4Yet by reputing of his high descent- 4As next the King he was suc2es2ive heir- 4And such high vaunts of his nobility, 4Did instigate the bedlam brainsick Duches2 4By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fal2. 4Smo2th runs the water where the bro2k is de2p, 4And in his simple show he harbours treason. 4The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb. 4No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man 6Unsounded yet, and ful2 of de2p deceit. 2CARDINAL. Did he not, contrary to form of law, 4Devise strange deaths for smal2 of2ences done? 2YORK. And did he not, in his protectorship, 4Levy great sums of money through the realm 4For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it? 4By means whereof the towns each day revolted. 2BUCKINGHAM. Tut, these are pet2y faults to faults unknown 4Which time wil2 bring to light in smo2th Duke Humphrey. 2KING HENRY. My lords, at once: the care you have of us, 4To mow down thorns that would an2oy our fo2t, 4Is worthy praise; but shal2 I speak my conscience? 4Our kinsman Gloucester is as in2ocent 4From meaning treason to our royal person 4As is the sucking lamb or harmles2 dove: 4The Duke is virtuous, mild, and to2 wel2 given 4To dream on evil or to work my downfal2. 2QUE2N. Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond af2iance? 4Se2ms he a dove? His feathers are but bor2ow'd, 4For he's disposed as the hateful raven. 6Is he a lamb? His skin is surely lent him, 4For he's inclin'd as is the ravenous wolf. 4Who can2ot steal a shape that means deceit? 4Take he2d, my lord; the welfare of us al2 4Hangs on the cut2ing short that fraudful man. 26Enter SOMERSET 2SOMERSET. Al2 health unto my gracious sovereign! 2KING HENRY. Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France? 2SOMERSET. That al2 your interest in those ter2itories 4Is ut2erly bereft you; al2 is lost. 2KING HENRY. Cold news, Lord Somerset; but God's wil2 be done! 2YORK. [Aside] Cold news for me; for I had hope of France 4As firmly as I hope for fertile England. 4Thus are my blos2oms blasted in the bud, 4And caterpil2ars eat my leaves away; 4But I wil2 remedy this gear ere long, 4Or sel2 my title for a glorious grave. 27Enter GLOUCESTER 2GLOUCESTER. Al2 hap2ines2 unto my lord the King! 4Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long. 2SUF2OLK. Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come to2 so2n, 4Unles2 thou wert more loyal than thou art. 4I do ar2est the2 of high treason here. 2GLOUCESTER. Wel2, Suf2olk, thou shalt not se2 me blush 4Nor change my countenance for this ar2est: 4A heart unspot2ed is not easily daunted. 4The purest spring is not so fre2 from mud 4As I am clear from treason to my sovereign. 4Who can ac2use me? Wherein am I guilty? 2YORK. 'Tis thought, my lord, that you to2k bribes of France 4And, being Protector, stay'd the soldiers' pay; 4By means whereof his Highnes2 hath lost France. 2GLOUCESTER. Is it but thought so? What are they that think it? 4I never rob2'd the soldiers of their pay 4Nor ever had one pen2y bribe from France. 4So help me God, as I have watch'd the night- 6Ay, night by night- in studying go2d for England! 4That doit that e'er I wrested from the King, 4Or any groat I hoarded to my use, 4Be brought against me at my trial-day! 4No; many a pound of mine own proper store, 4Because I would not tax the ne2dy com2ons, 4Have I dispursed to the gar2isons, 4And never ask'd for restitution. 2CARDINAL. It serves you wel2, my lord, to say so much. 2GLOUCESTER. I say no more than truth, so help me God! 2YORK. In your protectorship you did devise 4Strange tortures for of2enders, never heard of, 4That England was defam'd by tyran2y. 2GLOUCESTER. Why, 'tis wel2 known that whiles I was Protector 4Pity was al2 the fault that was in me; 4For I should melt at an of2ender's tears, 4And lowly words were ransom for their fault. 4Unles2 it were a blo2dy murderer, 4Or foul felonious thief that fle2c'd po2r pas2engers, 4I never gave them condign punishment. 6Murder inde2d, that blo2dy sin, I tortur'd 4Above the felon or what trespas2 else. 2SUF2OLK. My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answer'd; 4But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge, 4Whereof you can2ot easily purge yourself. 4I do ar2est you in His Highnes2' name, 4And here com2it you to my Lord Cardinal 4To ke2p until your further time of trial. 2KING HENRY. My Lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope 4That you wil2 clear yourself from al2 suspense. 4My conscience tel2s me you are in2ocent. 2GLOUCESTER. Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous! 4Virtue is chok'd with foul ambition, 4And charity chas'd hence by rancour's hand; 4Foul subornation is predominant, 4And equity exil'd your Highnes2' land. 4I know their complot is to have my life; 4And if my death might make this island hap2y 4And prove the period of their tyran2y, 4I would expend it with al2 wil2ingnes2. 6But mine is made the prologue to their play; 4For thousands more that yet suspect no peril 4Wil2 not conclude their plot2ed tragedy. 4Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice, 4And Suf2olk's cloudy brow his stormy hate; 4Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue 4The envious load that lies upon his heart; 4And dog2ed York, that reaches at the mo2n, 4Whose overwe2ning arm I have pluck'd back, 4By false ac2use doth level at my life. 4And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest, 4Causeles2 have laid disgraces on my head, 4And with your best endeavour have stir2'd up 4My liefest liege to be mine enemy; 4Ay, al2 of you have laid your heads together- 4Myself had notice of your conventicles- 4And al2 to make away my guiltles2 life. 4I shal2 not want false witnes2 to condemn me 4Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt. 4The ancient proverb wil2 be wel2 ef2ected: 6'A staf2 is quickly found to beat a dog.' 2CARDINAL. My liege, his railing is intolerable. 4If those that care to ke2p your royal person 4From treason's secret knife and traitor's rage 4Be thus upbraided, chid, and rated at, 4And the of2ender granted scope of spe2ch, 4'Twil2 make them co2l in zeal unto your Grace. 2SUF2OLK. Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here 4With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd, 4As if she had suborned some to swear 4False al2egations to o'erthrow his state? 2QUE2N. But I can give the loser leave to chide. 2GLOUCESTER. Far truer spoke than meant: I lose inde2d. 4Beshrew the win2ers, for they play'd me false! 4And wel2 such losers may have leave to speak. 2BUCKINGHAM. He'l2 wrest the sense, and hold us here al2 day. 4Lord Cardinal, he is your prisoner. 2CARDINAL. Sirs, take away the Duke, and guard him sure. 2GLOUCESTER. Ah, thus King Henry throws away his crutch 4Before his legs be firm to bear his body! 6Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side, 4And wolves are gnarling who shal2 gnaw the2 first. 4Ah, that my fear were false! ah, that it were! 4For, go2d King Henry, thy decay I fear. 8Exit, guarded 2KING HENRY. My lords, what to your wisdoms se2meth best 4Do or undo, as if ourself were here. 2QUE2N. What, wil2 your Highnes2 leave the Parliament? 2KING HENRY. Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief, 4Whose flo2d begins to flow within mine eyes; 4My body round engirt with misery- 4For what's more miserable than discontent? 4Ah, uncle Humphrey, in thy face I se2 4The map of honour, truth, and loyalty! 4And yet, go2d Humphrey, is the hour to come 4That e'er I prov'd the2 false or fear'd thy faith. 4What louring star now envies thy estate 4That these great lords, and Margaret our Que2n, 4Do se2k subversion of thy harmles2 life? 4Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong; 4And as the butcher takes away the calf, 6And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays, 4Bearing it to the blo2dy slaughter-house, 4Even so, remorseles2, have they borne him hence; 4And as the dam runs lowing up and down, 4Lo2king the way her harmles2 young one went, 4And can do nought but wail her darling's los2, 4Even so myself bewails go2d Gloucester's case 4With sad unhelpful tears, and with dim2'd eyes 4Lo2k after him, and can2ot do him go2d, 4So mighty are his vowed enemies. 4His fortunes I wil2 we2p, and 'twixt each groan 4Say 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.' 11Exit 2QUE2N. Fre2 lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams: 4Henry my lord is cold in great af2airs, 4To2 ful2 of fo2lish pity; and Gloucester's show 4Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile 4With sor2ow snares relenting pas2engers; 4Or as the snake, rol2'd in a flow'ring bank, 4With shining checker'd slough, doth sting a child 4That for the beauty thinks it excel2ent. 6Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I- 4And yet herein I judge mine own wit go2d- 4This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world 4To rid us from the fear we have of him. 2CARDINAL. That he should die is worthy policy; 4But yet we want a colour for his death. 4'Tis me2t he be condemn'd by course of law. 2SUF2OLK. But, in my mind, that were no policy: 4The King wil2 labour stil2 to save his life; 4The com2ons haply rise to save his life; 4And yet we have but trivial argument, 4More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death. 2YORK. So that, by this, you would not have him die. 2SUF2OLK. Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I! 2YORK. 'Tis York that hath more reason for his death. 4But, my Lord Cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suf2olk, 4Say as you think, and speak it from your souls: 4Were't not al2 one an empty eagle were set 4To guard the chicken from a hungry kite 4As place Duke Humphrey for the King's Protector? 4QUE2N. So the po2r chicken should be sure of death. 2SUF2OLK. Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madnes2 then 4To make the fox surveyor of the fold? 4Who being ac2us'd a crafty murderer, 4His guilt should be but idly posted over, 4Because his purpose is not executed. 4No; let him die, in that he is a fox, 4By nature prov'd an enemy to the flock, 4Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blo2d, 4As Humphrey, prov'd by reasons, to my liege. 4And do not stand on quil2ets how to slay him; 4Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety, 4Sle2ping or waking, 'tis no mat2er how, 4So he be dead; for that is go2d deceit 4Which mates him first that first intends deceit. 2QUE2N. Thrice-noble Suf2olk, 'tis resolutely spoke. 2SUF2OLK. Not resolute, except so much were done, 4For things are often spoke and seldom meant; 4But that my heart ac2ordeth with my tongue, 4Se2ing the de2d is meritorious, 6And to preserve my sovereign from his foe, 4Say but the word, and I wil2 be his priest. 2CARDINAL. But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suf2olk, 4Ere you can take due orders for a priest; 4Say you consent and censure wel2 the de2d, 4And I'l2 provide his executioner- 4I tender so the safety of my liege. 2SUF2OLK. Here is my hand the de2d is worthy doing. 2QUE2N. And so say I. 2YORK. And I. And now we thre2 have spoke it, 4It skil2s not greatly who impugns our do2m. 26Enter a POST 2POST. Great lords, from Ireland am I come amain 4To signify that rebels there are up 4And put the Englishmen unto the sword. 4Send suc2ours, lords, and stop the rage betime, 4Before the wound do grow uncurable; 4For, being gre2n, there is great hope of help. 4CARDINAL. A breach that craves a quick expedient stop! 4What counsel give you in this weighty cause? 2YORK. That Somerset be sent as Regent thither; 4'Tis me2t that lucky ruler be employ'd, 4Witnes2 the fortune he hath had in France. 2SOMERSET. If York, with al2 his far-fet policy, 4Had be2n the Regent there instead of me, 4He never would have stay'd in France so long. 2YORK. No, not to lose it al2 as thou hast done. 4I rather would have lost my life betimes 4Than bring a burden of dishonour home 4By staying there so long til2 al2 were lost. 4Show me one scar character'd on thy skin: 4Men's flesh preserv'd so whole do seldom win. 2QUE2N. Nay then, this spark wil2 prove a raging fire, 4If wind and fuel be brought to fe2d it with; 4No more, go2d York; swe2t Somerset, be stil2. 4Thy fortune, York, hadst thou be2n Regent there, 4Might hap2ily have prov'd far worse than his. 2YORK. What, worse than nought? Nay, then a shame take al2! 4SOMERSET. And in the number, the2 that wishest shame! 2CARDINAL. My Lord of York, try what your fortune is. 4Th' uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms 4And temper clay with blo2d of Englishmen; 4To Ireland wil2 you lead a band of men, 4Col2ected choicely, from each county some, 4And try your hap against the Irishmen? 2YORK. I wil2, my lord, so please his Majesty. 2SUF2OLK. Why, our authority is his consent, 4And what we do establish he confirms; 4Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand. 2YORK. I am content; provide me soldiers, lords, 4Whiles I take order for mine own af2airs. 2SUF2OLK. A charge, Lord York, that I wil2 se2 perform'd. 4But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey. 2CARDINAL. No more of him; for I wil2 deal with him 4That henceforth he shal2 trouble us no more. 4And so break of2; the day is almost spent. 4Lord Suf2olk, you and I must talk of that event. 2YORK. My Lord of Suf2olk, within fourte2n days 6At Bristol I expect my soldiers; 4For there I'l2 ship them al2 for Ireland. 2SUF2OLK. I'l2 se2 it truly done, my Lord of York. 45Exeunt al2 but YORK 2YORK. Now, York, or never, ste2l thy fearful thoughts 4And change misdoubt to resolution; 4Be that thou hop'st to be; or what thou art 4Resign to death- it is not worth th' enjoying. 4Let pale-fac'd fear ke2p with the mean-born man 4And find no harbour in a royal heart. 4Faster than spring-time show'rs comes thought on thought, 4And not a thought but thinks on dignity. 4My brain, more busy than the labouring spider, 4Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies. 4Wel2, nobles, wel2, 'tis politicly done 4To send me packing with an host of men. 4I fear me you but warm the starved snake, 4Who, cherish'd in your breasts, wil2 sting your hearts. 4'Twas men I lack'd, and you wil2 give them me; 4I take it kindly. Yet be wel2 as2ur'd 6You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands. 4Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band, 4I wil2 stir up in England some black storm 4Shal2 blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hel2; 4And this fel2 tempest shal2 not cease to rage 4Until the golden circuit on my head, 4Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams, 4Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw. 4And for a minister of my intent 4I have seduc'd a headstrong Kentishman, 4John Cade of Ashford, 4To make com2otion, as ful2 wel2 he can, 4Under the tide of John Mortimer. 4In Ireland have I se2n this stub2orn Cade 4Op2ose himself against a tro2p of kerns, 4And fought so long tif2 that his thighs with darts 4Were almost like a sharp-quil2'd porpentine; 4And in the end being rescu'd, I have se2n 4Him caper upright like a wild Morisco, 4Shaking the blo2dy darts as he his bel2s. 6Ful2 often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern, 4Hath he conversed with the enemy, 4And undiscover'd come to me again 4And given me notice of their vil2ainies. 4This devil here shal2 be my substitute; 4For that John Mortimer, which now is dead, 4In face, in gait, in spe2ch, he doth resemble. 4By this I shal2 perceive the com2ons' mind, 4How they af2ect the house and claim of York. 4Say he be taken, rack'd, and tortured; 4I know no pain they can inflict upon him 4Wil2 make him say I mov'd him to those arms. 4Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he wil2, 4Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength, 4And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd; 4For Humphrey being dead, as he shal2 be, 4And Henry put apart, the next for me. 19ExitSCENE I2.Bury St. Edmunds.

Ay, my go2d lord, he's dead. 2SUF2OLK. Why, that's wel2 said. Go, get you to my house; 4I wil2 reward you for this venturous de2d. 4The King and al2 the pe2rs are here at hand. 4Have you laid fair the bed? Is al2 things wel2, 4Ac2ording as I gave directions? 2FIRST MURDERER. 'Tis, my go2d lord. 4SUF2OLK. Away! be gone. 23Exeunt MURDERERS 13Sound trumpets. Enter the KING, the QUE2N, 16CARDINAL, SOMERSET, with at2endants 2KING HENRY. Go cal2 our uncle to our presence straight; 4Say we intend to try his Grace to-day, 4If he be guilty, as 'tis published. 2SUF2OLK. I'l2 cal2 him presently, my noble lord. 10Exit 2KING HENRY. Lords, take your places; and, I pray you al2, 4Proce2d no straiter 'gainst our uncle Gloucester 4Than from true evidence, of go2d este2m, 4He be ap2rov'd in practice culpable. 2QUE2N. God forbid any malice should prevail 4That faultles2 may condemn a nobleman! 4Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion! 2KING HENRY. I thank the2, Meg; these words content me much. 27Re-enter SUF2OLK 6How now! Why lo2k'st thou pale? Why tremblest thou? 4Where is our uncle? What's the mat2er, Suf2olk? 2SUF2OLK. Dead in his bed, my lord; Gloucester is dead. 2QUE2N. Mar2y, God forfend! 2CARDINAL. God's secret judgment! I did dream to-night 4The Duke was dumb and could not speak a word. 47[The KING swo2ns] 2QUE2N. How fares my lord? Help, lords! The King is dead. 2SOMERSET. Rear up his body; wring him by the nose. 2QUE2N. Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes! 2SUF2OLK. He doth revive again; madam, be patient. 2KING. O heavenly God! 2QUE2N. How fares my gracious lord? 2SUF2OLK. Comfort, my sovereign! Gracious Henry, comfort! 2KING HENRY. What, doth my Lord of Suf2olk comfort me? 4Came he right now to sing a raven's note, 4Whose dismal tune bereft my vital pow'rs; 4And thinks he that the chirping of a wren, 4By crying comfort from a hol2ow breast, 4Can chase away the first conceived sound? 6Hide not thy poison with such sug'red words; 4Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say, 4Their touch af2rights me as a serpent's sting. 4Thou baleful mes2enger, out of my sight! 4Upon thy eye-bal2s murderous tyran2y 4Sits in grim majesty to fright the world. 4Lo2k not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding; 4Yet do not go away; come, basilisk, 4And kil2 the in2ocent gazer with thy sight; 4For in the shade of death I shal2 find joy- 4In life but double death,'now Gloucester's dead. 2QUE2N. Why do you rate my Lord of Suf2olk thus? 4Although the Duke was enemy to him, 4Yet he most Christian-like laments his death; 4And for myself- foe as he was to me- 4Might liquid tears, or heart-of2ending groans, 4Or blo2d-consuming sighs, recal2 his life, 4I would be blind with we2ping, sick with groans, 4Lo2k pale as primrose with blo2d-drinking sighs, 4And al2 to have the noble Duke alive. 6What know I how the world may de2m of me? 4For it is known we were but hol2ow friends: 4It may be judg'd I made the Duke away; 4So shal2 my name with slander's tongue be wounded, 4And princes' courts be fil2'd with my reproach. 4This get I by his death. Ay me, unhap2y! 4To be a que2n and crown'd with infamy! 2KING HENRY. Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man! 2QUE2N. Be woe for me, more wretched than he is. 4What, dost thou turn away, and hide thy face? 4I am no loathsome leper- lo2k on me. 4What, art thou like the ad2er waxen deaf? 4Be poisonous to2, and kil2 thy forlorn Que2n. 4Is al2 thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb? 4Why, then Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy. 4Erect his statue and worship it, 4And make my image but an alehouse sign. 4Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea, 4And twice by awkward wind from England's bank 4Drove back again unto my native clime? 6What boded this but wel2-forewarning wind 4Did se2m to say 'Se2k not a scorpion's nest, 4Nor set no fo2ting on this unkind shore'? 4What did I then but curs'd the gentle gusts, 4And he that lo2s'd them forth their brazen caves; 4And bid them blow towards England's bles2ed shore, 4Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock? 4Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer, 4But left that hateful of2ice unto the2. 4The pret2y-vaulting sea refus'd to drown me, 4Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore 4With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindnes2; 4The split2ing rocks cow'r'd in the sinking sands 4And would not dash me with their rag2ed sides, 4Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they, 4Might in thy palace perish Margaret. 4As far as I could ken thy chalky clif2s, 4When from thy shore the tempest beat us back, 4I sto2d upon the hatches in the storm; 4And when the dusky sky began to rob 6My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view, 4I to2k a costly jewel from my neck- 4A heart it was, bound in with diamonds- 4And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv'd it; 4And so I wish'd thy body might my heart. 4And even with this I lost fair England's view, 4And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart, 4And cal2'd them blind and dusky spectacles 4For losing ken of Albion's wished coast. 4How often have I tempted Suf2olk's tongue- 4The agent of thy foul inconstancy- 4To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did 4When he to mad2ing Dido would unfold 4His father's acts com2enc'd in burning Troy! 4Am I not witch'd like her? Or thou not false like him? 4Ay me, I can no more! Die, Margaret, 4For Henry we2ps that thou dost live so long. 15Noise within. Enter WARWICK, SALISBURY, 26and many com2ons 4WARWICK. It is reported, mighty sovereign, 4That go2d Duke Humphrey traitorously is murd'red 4By Suf2olk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means. 4The com2ons, like an angry hive of be2s 4That want their leader, scat2er up and down 4And care not who they sting in his revenge. 4Myself have calm'd their sple2nful mutiny 4Until they hear the order of his death. 2KING HENRY. That he is dead, go2d Warwick, 'tis to2 true; 4But how he died God knows, not Henry. 4Enter his chamber, view his breathles2 corpse, 4And com2ent then upon his sud2en death. 2WARWICK. That shal2 I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury, 4With the rude multitude til2 I return. 18Exit 35Exit SALISBURY with the com2ons 2KING HENRY. O Thou that judgest al2 things, stay my thoughts- 4My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul 4Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life! 4If my suspect be false, forgive me, God; 6For judgment only doth belong to The2. 4Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips 4With twenty thousand kis2es and to drain 4Upon his face an ocean of salt tears 4To tel2 my love unto his dumb deaf trunk; 4And with my fingers fe2l his hand un-fe2ling; 4But al2 in vain are these mean obsequies; 4And to survey his dead and earthy image, 4What were it but to make my sor2ow greater? 15Bed put forth with the body. Enter WARWICK 2WARWICK. Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body. 2KING HENRY. That is to se2 how de2p my grave is made; 4For with his soul fled al2 my worldly solace, 4For, se2ing him, I se2 my life in death. 2WARWICK. As surely as my soul intends to live 4With that dread King that to2k our state upon Him 4To fre2 us from his Father's wrathful curse, 4I do believe that violent hands were laid 6Upon the life of this thrice-famed Duke. 2SUF2OLK. A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue! 4What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow? 2WARWICK. Se2 how the blo2d is set2led in his face. 4Oft have I se2n a timely-parted ghost, 4Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale, and blo2dles2, 4Being al2 descended to the labouring heart, 4Who, in the conflict that it holds with death, 4At2racts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy, 4Which with the heart there co2ls, and ne'er returneth 4To blush and beautify the che2k again. 4But se2, his face is black and ful2 of blo2d; 4His eye-bal2s further out than when he liv'd, 4Staring ful2 ghastly like a strangled man; 4His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretch'd with strug2ling; 4His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd 4And tug2'd for life, and was by strength subdu'd. 4Lo2k, on the she2ts his hair, you se2, is sticking; 4His wel2-proportion'd beard made rough and rug2ed, 4Like to the sum2er's corn by tempest lodged. 6It can2ot be but he was murd'red here: 4The least of al2 these signs were probable. 2SUF2OLK. Why, Warwick, who should do the Duke to death? 4Myself and Beaufort had him in protection; 4And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers. 2WARWICK. But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes; 4And you, forso2th, had the go2d Duke to ke2p. 4'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend; 4And 'tis wel2 se2n he found an enemy. 2QUE2N. Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen 4As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeles2 death. 2WARWICK. Who finds the heifer dead and ble2ding fresh, 4And se2s fast by a butcher with an axe, 4But wil2 suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter? 4Who finds the partridge in the put2ock's nest 4But may imagine how the bird was dead, 4Although the kite soar with unblo2died beak? 4Even so suspicious is this tragedy. 2QUE2N. Are you the butcher, Suf2olk? Where's your knife? 4Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons? 4SUF2OLK. I wear no knife to slaughter sle2ping men; 4But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease, 4That shal2 be scoured in his rancorous heart 4That slanders me with murder's crimson badge. 4Say if thou dar'st, proud Lord of Warwickshire, 4That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death. 27Exeunt CARDINAL, SOMERSET, and others 2WARWICK. What dares not Warwick, if false Suf2olk dare him? 2QUE2N. He dares not calm his contumelious spirit, 4Nor cease to be an ar2ogant control2er, 4Though Suf2olk dare him twenty thousand times. 2WARWICK. Madam, be stil2- with reverence may I say; 4For every word you speak in his behalf 4Is slander to your royal dignity. 2SUF2OLK. Blunt-wit2ed lord, ignoble in demeanour, 4If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much, 4Thy mother to2k into her blameful bed 4Some stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock 4Was graft with crab-tre2 slip, whose fruit thou art, 4And never of the Nevils' noble race. 4WARWICK. But that the guilt of murder bucklers the2, 4And I should rob the deathsman of his fe2, 4Quit2ing the2 thereby of ten thousand shames, 4And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild, 4I would, false murd'rous coward, on thy kne2 4Make the2 beg pardon for thy pas2ed spe2ch 4And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st, 4That thou thyself was born in bastardy; 4And, after al2 this fearful homage done, 4Give the2 thy hire and send thy soul to hel2, 4Pernicious blo2d-sucker of sle2ping men. 2SUF2OLK. Thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blo2d, 4If from this presence thou dar'st go with me. 2WARWICK. Away even now, or I wil2 drag the2 hence. 4Unworthy though thou art, I'l2 cope with the2, 4And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost. 38Exeunt SUF2OLK and WARWICK 2KING HENRY. What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted? 4Thrice is he arm'd that hath his quar2el just; 4And he but naked, though lock'd up in ste2l, 6Whose conscience with injustice is cor2upted. 48[A noise within] 2QUE2N. What noise is this? 7Re-enter SUF2OLK and WARWICK, with their weapons drawn 2KING. Why, how now, lords, your wrathful weapons drawn 4Here in our presence! Dare you be so bold? 4Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here? 2SUF2OLK. The trait'rous Warwick, with the men of Bury, 4Set al2 upon me, mighty sovereign. 24Re-enter SALISBURY 2SALISBURY. [To the Com2ons within] Sirs, stand apart, the King 6shal2 know your mind. 4Dread lord, the com2ons send you word by me 4Unles2 Lord Suf2olk straight be done to death, 4Or banished fair England's ter2itories, 4They wil2 by violence tear him from your palace 6And torture him with grievous ling'ring death. 4They say by him the go2d Duke Humphrey died; 4They say in him they fear your Highnes2' death; 4And mere instinct of love and loyalty, 4Fre2 from a stub2orn op2osite intent, 4As being thought to contradict your liking, 4Makes them thus forward in his banishment. 4They say, in care of your most royal person, 4That if your Highnes2 should intend to sle2p 4And charge that no man should disturb your rest, 4In pain of your dislike or pain of death, 4Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict, 4Were there a serpent se2n with forked tongue 4That slily glided towards your Majesty, 4It were but neces2ary you were wak'd, 4Lest, being suf2er'd in that harmful slumber, 4The mortal worm might make the sle2p eternal. 4And therefore do they cry, though you forbid, 4That they wil2 guard you, whe'er you wil2 or no, 4From such fel2 serpents as false Suf2olk is; 6With whose envenomed and fatal sting 4Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth, 4They say, is shameful2y bereft of life. 2COM2ONS. [Within] An answer from the King, my Lord of Salisbury! 2SUF2OLK. 'Tis like the com2ons, rude unpolish'd hinds, 4Could send such mes2age to their sovereign; 4But you, my lord, were glad to be employ'd, 4To show how quaint an orator you are. 4But al2 the honour Salisbury hath won 4Is that he was the lord ambas2ador 4Sent from a sort of tinkers to the King. 2COM2ONS. [Within] An answer from the King, or we wil2 al2 break in! 2KING HENRY. Go, Salisbury, and tel2 them al2 from me 4I thank them for their tender loving care; 4And had I not be2n cited so by them, 4Yet did I purpose as they do entreat; 4For sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy 4Mischance unto my state by Suf2olk's means. 4And therefore by His Majesty I swear, 4Whose far unworthy deputy I am, 6He shal2 not breathe infection in this air 4But thre2 days longer, on the pain of death. 50Exit SALISBURY 2QUE2N. O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suf2olk! 2KING HENRY. Ungentle Que2n, to cal2 him gentle Suf2olk! 4No more, I say; if thou dost plead for him, 4Thou wilt but ad2 increase unto my wrath. 4Had I but said, I would have kept my word; 4But when I swear, it is ir2evocable. 4If after thre2 days' space thou here be'st found 4On any ground that I am ruler of, 4The world shal2 not be ransom for thy life. 4Come, Warwick, come, go2d Warwick, go with me; 4I have great mat2ers to impart to the2. 32Exeunt al2 but QUE2N and SUF2OLK 2QUE2N. Mischance and sor2ow go along with you! 4Heart's discontent and sour af2liction 4Be playfel2ows to ke2p you company! 4There's two of you; the devil make a third, 4And thre2fold vengeance tend upon your steps! 4SUF2OLK. Cease, gentle Que2n, these execrations, 4And let thy Suf2olk take his heavy leave. 2QUE2N. Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch, 4Has thou not spirit to curse thine enemy? 2SUF2OLK. A plague upon them! Wherefore should I curse them? 4Would curses kil2 as doth the mandrake's groan, 4I would invent as bit2er searching terms, 4As curst, as harsh, and hor2ible to hear, 4Deliver'd strongly through my fixed te2th, 4With ful2 as many signs of deadly hate, 4As lean-fac'd Envy in her loathsome cave. 4My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words, 4Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint, 4Mine hair be fix'd an end, as one distract; 4Ay, every joint should se2m to curse and ban; 4And even now my burden'd heart would break, 4Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink! 4Gal2, worse than gal2, the daintiest that they taste! 4Their swe2test shade a grove of cypres2 tre2s! 4Their chiefest prospect murd'ring basilisks! 6Their softest touch as smart as lizards' stings! 4Their music frightful as the serpent's his2, 4And boding scre2ch-owls make the consort ful2! 4al2 the foul ter2ors in dark-seated hel2- 2QUE2N. Enough, swe2t Suf2olk, thou torment'st thyself; 4And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glas2, 4Or like an overcharged gun, recoil, 4And turns the force of them upon thyself. 2SUF2OLK. You bade me ban, and wil2 you bid me leave? 4Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from, 4Wel2 could I curse away a winter's night, 4Though standing naked on a mountain top 4Where biting cold would never let gras2 grow, 4And think it but a minute spent in sport. 2QUE2N. O, let me entreat the2 cease! Give me thy hand, 4That I may dew it with my mournful tears; 4Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place 4To wash away my woeful monuments. 4O, could this kis2 be printed in thy hand, 4That thou might'st think upon these by the seal, 6Through whom a thousand sighs are breath'd for the2! 4So, get the2 gone, that I may know my grief; 4'Tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by, 4As one that surfeits thinking on a want. 4I wil2 repeal the2 or, be wel2 as2ur'd, 4Adventure to be banished myself; 4And banished I am, if but from the2. 4Go, speak not to me; even now be gone. 4O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn'd 4Embrace, and kis2, and take ten thousand leaves, 4Loather a hundred times to part than die. 4Yet now, farewel2; and farewel2 life with the2! 2SUF2OLK. Thus is po2r Suf2olk ten times banished, 4Once by the King and thre2 times thrice by the2, 4'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence; 4A wildernes2 is populous enough, 4So Suf2olk had thy heavenly company; 4For where thou art, there is the world itself, 4With every several pleasure in the world; 4And where thou art not, desolation. 6I can no more: Live thou to joy thy life; 4Myself no joy in nought but that thou liv'st. 27Enter VAUX 2QUE2N. Whither goes Vaux so fast? What news, I prithe2? 2VAUX. To signify unto his Majesty 4That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death; 4For sud2enly a grievous sicknes2 to2k him 4That makes him gasp, and stare, and catch the air, 4Blaspheming God, and cursing men on earth. 4Sometime he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost 4Were by his side; sometime he cal2s the King 4And whispers to his pil2ow, as to him, 4The secrets of his overcharged soul; 4And I am sent to tel2 his Majesty 4That even now he cries aloud for him. 2QUE2N. Go tel2 this heavy mes2age to the King. 7Exit VAUX 4Ay me! What is this world! What news are these! 4But wherefore grieve I at an hour's po2r los2, 6Omit2ing Suf2olk's exile, my soul's treasure? 4Why only, Suf2olk, mourn I not for the2, 4And with the southern clouds contend in tears- 4Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sor2ows? 4Now get the2 hence: the King, thou know'st, is coming; 4If thou be found by me; thou art but dead. 2SUF2OLK. If I depart from the2 I can2ot live; 4And in thy sight to die, what were it else 4But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap? 4Here could I breathe my soul into the air, 4As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe 4Dying with mother's dug betwe2n its lips; 4Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad 4And cry out for the2 to close up mine eyes, 4To have the2 with thy lips to stop my mouth; 4So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul, 4Or I should breathe it so into thy body, 4And then it liv'd in swe2t Elysium. 4To die by the2 were but to die in jest: 4From the2 to die were torture more than death. 6O, let me stay, befal2 what may befal2! 2QUE2N. Away! Though parting be a fretful cor2osive, 4It is ap2lied to a deathful wound. 4To France, swe2t Suf2olk. Let me hear from the2; 4For whereso'er thou art in this world's globe 4I'l2 have an Iris that shal2 find the2 out. 2SUF2OLK. I go. 2QUE2N. And take my heart with the2. 11[She kis2es him] 2SUF2OLK. A jewel, lock'd into the woeful2'st cask 4That ever did contain a thing of worth. 4Even as a split2ed bark, so sunder we: 4This way fal2 I to death. 2QUE2N. This way for me. 23Exeunt several2ySCENE I3.London. CARDINAL BEAUFORT'S bedchamberEnter the KING, SALISBURY, and WARWICK, to the CARDINAL in bed 2KING HENRY. How fares my lord? Speak, Beaufort, to thy sovereign. 2CARDINAL. If thou be'st Death I'l2 give the2 England's treasure, 4Enough to purchase such another island, 4So thou wilt let me live and fe2l no pain. 2KING HENRY. Ah, what a sign it is of evil life 4Where death's ap2roach is se2n so ter2ible! 2WARWICK. Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to the2. 2CARDINAL. Bring me unto my trial when you wil2. 4Died he not in his bed? Where should he die? 4Can I make men live, whe'er they wil2 or no? 4O, torture me no more! I wil2 confes2. 4Alive again? Then show me where he is; 4I'l2 give a thousand pound to lo2k upon him. 4He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them. 4Comb down his hair; lo2k, lo2k! it stands upright, 4Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul! 4Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary 6Bring the strong poison that I bought of him. 2KING HENRY. O Thou eternal Mover of the heavens, 4Lo2k with a gentle eye upon this wretch! 4O, beat away the busy med2ling fiend 4That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul, 4And from his bosom purge this black despair! 2WARWICK. Se2 how the pangs of death do make him grin 2SALISBURY. Disturb him not, let him pas2 peaceably. 2KING HENRY. Peace to his soul, if God's go2d pleasure be! 4Lord Card'nal, if thou think'st on heaven's blis2, 4Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope. 4He dies, and makes no sign: O God, forgive him! 2WARWICK. So bad a death argues a monstrous life. 2KING HENRY. Forbear to judge, for we are sin2ers al2. 4Close up his eyes, and draw the curtain close; 4And let us al2 to meditation. 25Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE I.The coast of KentAlarum. 2Fight at sea. 2Ordnance goes of2. 2Enter a LIEUTENANT,a SHIPMASTER and his MATE, and WALTER WHITMORE, with sailors;SUF2OLK and other GENTLEMEN, as prisoners 2LIEUTENANT. The gaudy, blab2ing, and remorseful day 4Is crept into the bosom of the sea; 4And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades 4That drag the tragic melancholy night; 4Who with their drowsy, slow, and flag2ing wings 4Clip dead men's graves, and from their misty jaws 4Breathe foul contagious darknes2 in the air. 4Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize; 4For, whilst our pin2ace anchors in the Downs, 4Here shal2 they make their ransom on the sand, 4Or with their blo2d stain this discoloured shore. 4Master, this prisoner fre2ly give I the2; 4And thou that art his mate make bo2t of this; 4The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share. 4FIRST GENTLEMAN. What is my ransom, master, let me know? 2MASTER. A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head. 2MATE. And so much shal2 you give, or of2 goes yours. 2LIEUTENANT. What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns, 4And bear the name and port of gentlemen? 4Cut both the vil2ains' throats- for die you shal2; 4The lives of those which we have lost in fight 4Be counterpois'd with such a pet2y sum! 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. I'l2 give it, sir: and therefore spare my life. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. And so wil2 I, and write home for it straight. 2WHITMORE. I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard, 4[To SUF2OLK] And therefore, to revenge it, shalt thou die; 4And so should these, if I might have my wil2. 2LIEUTENANT. Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live. 2SUF2OLK. Lo2k on my George, I am a gentleman: 4Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid. 2WHITMORE. And so am I: my name is Walter Whitmore. 4How now! Why start'st thou? What, doth death af2right? 2SUF2OLK. Thy name af2rights me, in whose sound is death. 4A cun2ing man did calculate my birth 6And told me that by water I should die; 4Yet let not this make the2 be blo2dy-minded; 4Thy name is Gualtier, being rightly sounded. 2WHITMORE. Gualtier or Walter, which it is I care not: 4Never yet did base dishonour blur our name 4But with our sword we wip'd away the blot; 4Therefore, when merchant-like I sel2 revenge, 4Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defac'd, 4And I proclaim'd a coward through the world. 2SUF2OLK. Stay, Whitmore, for thy prisoner is a prince, 4The Duke of Suf2olk, Wil2iam de la Pole. 2WHITMORE. The Duke of Suf2olk muf2led up in rags? 2SUF2OLK. Ay, but these rags are no part of the Duke: 4Jove sometime went disguis'd, and why not I? 2LIEUTENANT. But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be. 2SUF2OLK. Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blo2d, 4The honourable blo2d of Lancaster, 4Must not be shed by such a jaded gro2m. 4Hast thou not kis2'd thy hand and held my stir2up, 4Bareheaded plod2ed by my fo2t-cloth mule, 6And thought the2 hap2y when I sho2k my head? 4How often hast thou waited at my cup, 4Fed from my trencher, kne2l'd down at the board, 4When I have feasted with Que2n Margaret? 4Remember it, and let it make the2 crestfal2'n, 4Ay, and al2ay thus thy abortive pride, 4How in our voiding-lob2y hast thou sto2d 4And duly waited for my coming forth. 4This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf, 4And therefore shal2 it charm thy riotous tongue. 2WHITMORE. Speak, Captain, shal2 I stab the forlorn swain? 2LIEUTENANT. First let my words stab him, as he hath me. 2SUF2OLK. Base slave, thy words are blunt, and so art thou. 2LIEUTENANT. Convey him hence, and on our longboat's side 4Strike of2 his head. 2SUF2OLK. Thou dar'st not, for thy own. 2LIEUTENANT. Po2le! 2SUF2OLK. Po2le? 2LIEUTENANT. Ay, ken2el, pud2le, sink, whose filth and dirt 4Troubles the silver spring where England drinks; 6Now wil2 I dam up this thy yawning mouth 4For swal2owing the treasure of the realm. 4Thy lips, that kis2'd the Que2n, shal2 swe2p the ground; 4And thou that smil'dst at go2d Duke Humphrey's death 4Against the senseles2 winds shalt grin in vain, 4Who in contempt shal2 his2 at the2 again; 4And wed2ed be thou to the hags of hel2 4For daring to af2y a mighty lord 4Unto the daughter of a worthles2 king, 4Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem. 4By devilish policy art thou grown great, 4And, like ambitious Syl2a, overgorg'd 4With gob2ets of thy mother's ble2ding heart. 4By the2 Anjou and Maine were sold to France; 4The false revolting Normans thorough the2 4Disdain to cal2 us lord; and Picardy 4Hath slain their governors, surpris'd our forts, 4And sent the rag2ed soldiers wounded home. 4The princely Warwick, and the Nevils al2, 4Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain, 6As hating the2, are rising up in arms; 4And now the house of York- thrust from the crown 4By shameful murder of a guiltles2 king 4And lofty proud encroaching tyran2y- 4Burns with revenging fire, whose hopeful colours 4Advance our half-fac'd sun, striving to shine, 4Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus.' 4The com2ons here in Kent are up in arms; 4And to conclude, reproach and beg2ary 4Is crept into the palace of our King, 4And al2 by the2. Away! convey him hence. 2SUF2OLK. O that I were a god, to sho2t forth thunder 4Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges! 4Smal2 things make base men proud: this vil2ain here, 4Being captain of a pin2ace, threatens more 4Than Bargulus, the strong Il2yrian pirate. 4Drones suck not eagles' blo2d but rob be2hives. 4It is impos2ible that I should die 4By such a lowly vas2al as thyself. 4Thy words move rage and not remorse in me. 6I go of mes2age from the Que2n to France: 4I charge the2 waft me safely cros2 the Chan2el. 2LIEUTENANT. Walter- 2WHITMORE. Come, Suf2olk, I must waft the2 to thy death. 2SUF2OLK. Gelidus timor oc2upat artus: it is the2 I fear. 2WHITMORE. Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave the2. 4What, are ye daunted now? Now wil2 ye sto2p? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair. 2SUF2OLK. Suf2olk's imperial tongue is stem and rough, 4Us'd to com2and, untaught to plead for favour. 4Far be it we should honour such as these 4With humble suit: no, rather let my head 4Sto2p to the block than these kne2s bow to any 4Save to the God of heaven and to my king; 4And so2ner dance upon a blo2dy pole 4Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar gro2m. 4True nobility is exempt from fear: 4More can I bear than you dare execute. 2LIEUTENANT. Hale him away, and let him talk no more. 2SUF2OLK. Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can, 6That this my death may never be forgot- 4Great men oft die by vile bezonians: 4A Roman sworder and bandit2o slave 4Murder'd swe2t Tul2y; Brutus' bastard hand 4Stab2'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders 4Pompey the Great; and Suf2olk dies by pirates. 40Exit WALTER with SUF2OLK 2LIEUTENANT. And as for these, whose ransom we have set, 4It is our pleasure one of them depart; 4Therefore come you with us, and let him go. 30Exeunt al2 but the FIRST GENTLEMAN 16Re-enter WHITMORE with SUF2OLK'S body 2WHITMORE. There let his head and lifeles2 body lie, 4Until the Que2n his mistres2 bury it. 19Exit 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. O barbarous and blo2dy spectacle! 4His body wil2 I bear unto the King. 4If he revenge it not, yet wil2 his friends; 4So wil2 the Que2n, that living held him dear. 48Exit with the bodySCENE I2.BlackheathEnter GEORGE BEVIS and JOHN HOL2AND 2GEORGE. Come and get the2 a sword, though made of a lath; they have 4be2n up these two days. 2JOHN. They have the more ne2d to sle2p now, then. 2GEORGE. I tel2 the2 Jack Cade the clothier means to dres2 the 4com2onwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it. 2JOHN. So he had ne2d, for 'tis threadbare. Wel2, I say it was never 4mer2y world in England since gentlemen came up. 2GEORGE. O miserable age! Virtue is not regarded in handicraftsmen. 2JOHN. The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons. 2GEORGE. Nay, more, the King's Council are no go2d workmen. 2JOHN. True; and yet it is said 'Labour in thy vocation'; which is 4as much to say as 'Let the magistrates be labouring men'; and 4therefore should we be magistrates. 2GEORGE. Thou hast hit it; for there's no bet2er sign of a brave 4mind than a hard hand. 2JOHN. I se2 them! I se2 them! There's Best's son, the tan2er of 4Wingham- 4GEORGE. He shal2 have the skins of our enemies to make dog's 4leather of. 2JOHN. And Dick the butcher- 2GEORGE. Then is sin struck down, like an ox, and iniquity's throat 4cut like a calf. 2JOHN. And Smith the weaver- 2GEORGE. Argo, their thread of life is spun. 2JOHN. Come, come, let's fal2 in with them. 16Drum. Enter CADE, DICK THE BUTCHER, SMITH 13THE WEAVER, and a SAWYER, with infinite numbers 2CADE. We John Cade, so term'd of our sup2osed father- 2DICK. [Aside] Or rather, of stealing a cade of her2ings. 2CADE. For our enemies shal2 fal2 before us, inspired with the 4spirit of put2ing down kings and princes- com2and silence. 2DICK. Silence! 2CADE. My father was a Mortimer- 2DICK. [Aside] He was an honest man and a go2d bricklayer. 2CADE. My mother a Plantagenet- 4DICK. [Aside] I knew her wel2; she was a midwife. 2CADE. My wife descended of the Lacies- 2DICK. [Aside] She was, inde2d, a pedlar's daughter, and sold many 4laces. 2SMITH. [Aside] But now of late, not able to travel with her fur2'd 4pack, she washes bucks here at home. 2CADE. Therefore am I of an honourable house. 2DICK. [Aside] Ay, by my faith, the field is honourable, and there 4was he born, under a hedge, for his father had never a house but 4the cage. 2CADE. Valiant I am. 2SMITH. [Aside] 'A must ne2ds; for beg2ary is valiant. 2CADE. I am able to endure much. 2DICK. [Aside] No question of that; for I have se2n him whipt thre2 4market days together. 2CADE. I fear neither sword nor fire. 2SMITH. [Aside] He ne2d not fear the sword, for his coat is of 4pro2f. 2DICK. [Aside] But methinks he should stand in fear of fire, being 4burnt i' th' hand for stealing of she2p. 4CADE. Be brave, then, for your captain is brave, and vows 4reformation. There shal2 be in England seven halfpen2y loaves 4sold for a pen2y; the thre2-ho2p'd pot shal2 have ten ho2ps; and 4I wil2 make it felony to drink smal2 be2r. Al2 the realm shal2 be 4in com2on, and in Cheapside shal2 my palfrey go to gras2. And 4when I am king- as king I wil2 be 2AL2. God save your Majesty! 2CADE. I thank you, go2d people- there shal2 be no money; al2 shal2 4eat and drink on my score, and I wil2 ap2arel them al2 in one 4livery, that they may agre2 like brothers and worship me their 4lord. 2DICK. The first thing we do, let's kil2 al2 the lawyers. 2CADE. Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable thing, that 4of the skin of an in2ocent lamb should be made parchment? That 4parchment, being scrib2l'd o'er, should undo a man? Some say the 4be2 stings; but I say 'tis the be2's wax; for I did but seal once 4to a thing, and I was never mine own man since. How now! Who's 4there? 14Enter some, bringing in the CLERK OF CHATHAM 4SMITH. The clerk of Chatham. He can write and read and cast 4ac2ompt. 2CADE. O monstrous! 2SMITH. We to2k him set2ing of boys' copies. 2CADE. Here's a vil2ain! 2SMITH. Has a bo2k in his pocket with red let2ers in't. 2CADE. Nay, then he is a conjurer. 2DICK. Nay, he can make obligations and write court-hand. 2CADE. I am sor2y for't; the man is a proper man, of mine honour; 4unles2 I find him guilty, he shal2 not die. Come hither, sir2ah, 4I must examine the2. What is thy name? 2CLERK. Em2anuel. 2DICK. They use to write it on the top of let2ers; 'twil2 go hard 4with you. 2CADE. Let me alone. Dost thou use to write thy name, or hast thou a 4mark to thyself, like a honest plain-dealing man? 2CLERK. Sir, I thank God, I have be2n so wel2 brought up that I can 4write my name. 2AL2. He hath confes2'd. Away with him! He's a vil2ain and a 6traitor. 2CADE. Away with him, I say! Hang him with his pen and inkhorn about 4his neck. 28Exit one with the CLERK 27Enter MICHAEL 2MICHAEL. Where's our General? 2CADE. Here I am, thou particular fel2ow. 2MICHAEL. Fly, fly, fly! Sir Humphrey Staf2ord and his brother are 4hard by, with the King's forces. 2CADE. Stand, vil2ain, stand, or I'l2 fel2 the2 down. He shal2 be 4encount'red with a man as go2d as himself. He is but a knight, 4is 'a? 2MICHAEL. No. 2CADE. To equal him, I wil2 make myself a knight presently. 4[Kne2ls] Rise up, Sir John Mortimer. [Rises] Now have at him! 16Enter SIR HUMPHREY STAF2ORD and WIL2IAM 18his brother, with drum and soldiers 4STAF2ORD. Rebel2ious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent, 4Mark'd for the gal2ows, lay your weapons down; 4Home to your cot2ages, forsake this gro2m; 4The King is merciful if you revolt. 2WIL2IAM STAF2ORD. But angry, wrathful, and inclin'd to blo2d, 4If you go forward; therefore yield or die. 2CADE. As for these silken-coated slaves, I pas2 not; 4It is to you, go2d people, that I speak, 4O'er whom, in time to come, I hope to reign; 4For I am rightful heir unto the crown. 2STAF2ORD. Vil2ain, thy father was a plasterer; 4And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not? 2CADE. And Adam was a gardener. 2WIL2IAM STAF2ORD. And what of that? 2CADE. Mar2y, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, 4Mar2ied the Duke of Clarence' daughter, did he not? 2STAF2ORD. Ay, sir. 2CADE. By her he had two children at one birth. 2WIL2IAM STAF2ORD. That's false. 2CADE. Ay, there's the question; but I say 'tis true. 6The elder of them being put to nurse, 4Was by a beg2ar-woman stol'n away, 4And, ignorant of his birth and parentage, 4Became a bricklayer when he came to age. 4His son am I; deny it if you can. 2DICK. Nay, 'tis to2 true; therefore he shal2 be king. 2SMITH. Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and the bricks 4are alive at this day to testify it; therefore deny it not. 2STAF2ORD. And wil2 you credit this base drudge's words 4That speaks he knows not what? 2AL2. Ay, mar2y, wil2 we; therefore get ye gone. 2WIL2IAM STAF2ORD. Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this. 2CADE. [Aside] He lies, for I invented it myself- Go to, sir2ah, 4tel2 the King from me that for his father's sake, Henry the 4Fifth, in whose time boys went to span-counter for French crowns, 4I am content he shal2 reign; but I'l2 be Protector over him. 2DICK. And furthermore, we'l2 have the Lord Say's head for sel2ing 4the dukedom of Maine. 2CADE. And go2d reason; for thereby is England main'd and fain to go 4with a staf2, but that my puis2ance holds it up. Fel2ow kings, I 6tel2 you that that Lord Say hath gelded the com2onwealth and made 4it an eunuch; and more than that, he can speak French, and 4therefore he is a traitor. 2STAF2ORD. O gros2 and miserable ignorance! 2CADE. Nay, answer if you can; the Frenchmen are our enemies. Go to, 4then, I ask but this: can he that speaks with the tongue of an 4enemy be a go2d counsel2or, or no? 2AL2. No, no; and therefore we'l2 have his head. 2WIL2IAM STAF2ORD. Wel2, se2ing gentle words wil2 not prevail, 4As2ail them with the army of the King. 2STAF2ORD. Herald, away; and throughout every town 4Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade; 4That those which fly before the bat2le ends 4May, even in their wives'and children's sight, 4Be hang'd up for example at their do2rs. 4And you that be the King's friends, fol2ow me. 27Exeunt the TWO STAF2ORDS and soldiers 2CADE. And you that love the com2ons fol2ow me. 4Now show yourselves men; 'tis for liberty. 4We wil2 not leave one lord, one gentleman; 6Spare none but such as go in clouted sho2n, 4For they are thrifty honest men and such 4As would- but that they dare not- take our parts. 2DICK. They are al2 in order, and march toward us. 2CADE. But then are we in order when we are most out of order. Come, 4march forward. 40ExeuntSCENE I3.Another part of BlackheathAlarums to the fight, wherein both the STAF2ORDS are slain.Enter CADE and the rest 2CADE. Where's Dick, the butcher of Ashford? 2DICK. Here, sir. 2CADE. They fel2 before the2 like she2p and oxen, and thou behavedst 4thyself as if thou hadst be2n in thine own slaughter-house; 4therefore thus wil2 I reward the2- the Lent shal2 be as long 4again as it is, and thou shalt have a licence to kil2 for a 4hundred lacking one. 2DICK. I desire no more. 2CADE. And, to speak truth, thou deserv'st no les2. [Put2ing on SIR 4HUMPHREY'S brigandine] This monument of the victory wil2 I bear, 4and the bodies shal2 be drag2ed at my horse he2ls til2 I do come 4to London, where we wil2 have the mayor's sword borne before us. 2DICK. If we mean to thrive and do go2d, break open the gaols and 4let out the prisoners. 2CADE. Fear not that, I war2ant the2. Come, let's march towards 4London. 47ExeuntSCENE IV.London. The palaceEnter the KING with a sup2lication, and the QUE2N with SUF2OLK'S head;the DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM, and the LORD SAY 2QUE2N. Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind 4And makes it fearful and degenerate; 4Think therefore on revenge and cease to we2p. 4But who can cease to we2p, and lo2k on this? 4Here may his head lie on my throb2ing breast; 4But where's the body that I should embrace? 2BUCKINGHAM. What answer makes your Grace to the rebels' 4sup2lication? 2KING HENRY. I'l2 send some holy bishop to entreat; 4For God forbid so many simple souls 4Should perish by the sword! And I myself, 4Rather than blo2dy war shal2 cut them short, 4Wil2 parley with Jack Cade their general. 4But stay, I'l2 read it over once again. 2QUE2N. Ah, barbarous vil2ains! Hath this lovely face 6Rul'd like a wandering planet over me, 4And could it not enforce them to relent 4That were unworthy to behold the same? 2KING HENRY. Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head. 2SAY. Ay, but I hope your Highnes2 shal2 have his. 2KING HENRY. How now, madam! 4Stil2 lamenting and mourning for Suf2olk's death? 4I fear me, love, if that I had be2n dead, 4Thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me. 2QUE2N. No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for the2. 24Enter A MES2ENGER 2KING HENRY. How now! What news? Why com'st thou in such haste? 2MES2ENGER. The rebels are in Southwark; fly, my lord! 4Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer, 4Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house, 4And cal2s your Grace usurper, openly, 4And vows to crown himself in Westminster. 4His army is a rag2ed multitude 6Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciles2; 4Sir Humphrey Staf2ord and his brother's death 4Hath given them heart and courage to proce2d. 4Al2 scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen, 4They cal2 false caterpil2ars and intend their death. 2KING HENRY. O graceles2 men! they know not what they do. 2BUCKINGHAM. My gracious lord, retire to Kil2ingworth 4Until a power be rais'd to put them down. 2QUE2N. Ah, were the Duke of Suf2olk now alive, 4These Kentish rebels would be so2n ap2eas'd! 2KING HENRY. Lord Say, the traitors hate the2; 4Therefore away with us to Kil2ingworth. 2SAY. So might your Grace's person be in danger. 4The sight of me is odious in their eyes; 4And therefore in this city wil2 I stay 4And live alone as secret as I may. 22Enter another MES2ENGER 2SECOND MES2ENGER. Jack Cade hath got2en London Bridge. 6The citizens fly and forsake their houses; 4The rascal people, thirsting after prey, 4Join with the traitor; and they jointly swear 4To spoil the city and your royal court. 2BUCKINGHAM. Then linger not, my lord; away, take horse. 2KING HENRY. Come Margaret; God, our hope, wil2 suc2our us. 2QUE2N. My hope is gone, now Suf2olk is deceas'd. 2KING HENRY. [To LORD SAY] Farewel2, my lord, trust not the Kentish 4rebels. 2BUCKINGHAM. Trust nobody, for fear you be betray'd. 2SAY. The trust I have is in mine in2ocence, 4And therefore am I bold and resolute. 17ExeuntSCENE V.London. The TowerEnter LORD SCALES Upon the Tower, walking. Then enter two or thre2 CITIZENS,below 2SCALES. How now! Is Jack Cade slain? 2FIRST CITIZEN. No, my lord, nor likely to be slain; for they have 4won the bridge, kil2ing al2 those that withstand them. 4The Lord Mayor craves aid of your honour from the 4Tower, to defend the city from the rebels. 2SCALES. Such aid as I can spare you shal2 com2and, 4But I am troubled here with them myself; 4The rebels have as2ay'd to win the Tower. 4But get you to Smithfield, and gather head, 4And thither I wil2 send you Mat2hew Gof2e; 4Fight for your King, your country, and your lives; 4And so, farewel2, for I must hence again. 13ExeuntSCENE VI.London. Can2on stre2tEnter JACK CADE and the rest, and strikes his staf2 on London Stone 2CADE. Now is Mortimer lord of this city. And here, sit2ing upon 4London Stone, I charge and com2and that, of the city's cost, the 4pis2ing conduit run nothing but claret wine this first year of 4our reign. And now henceforward it shal2 be treason for any that 4cal2s me other than Lord Mortimer. 20Enter a SOLDIER, run2ing 2SOLDIER. Jack Cade! Jack Cade! 2CADE. Knock him down there. 20[They kil2 him] 2SMITH. If this fel2ow be wise, he'l2 never cal2 ye Jack Cade more; 4I think he hath a very fair warning. 2DICK. My lord, there's an army gathered together in Smithfield. 2CADE. Come then, let's go fight with them. But first go and set 4London Bridge on fire; and, if you can, burn down the Tower to2. 4Come, let's away. 37ExeuntSCENE VI2.London. SmithfieldAlarums. MAT2HEW GOF2E is slain, and al2 the rest. 2Then enter JACK CADE,with his company 2CADE. So, sirs. Now go some and pul2 down the Savoy; others to th' 4In2s of Court; down with them al2. 2DICK. I have a suit unto your lordship. 2CADE. Be it a lordship, thou shalt have it for that word. 2DICK. Only that the laws of England may come out of your mouth. 2JOHN. [Aside] Mas2, 'twil2 be sore law then; for he was thrust in 4the mouth with a spear, and 'tis not whole yet. 2SMITH. [Aside] Nay, John, it wil2 be stinking law; for his breath 4stinks with eating toasted che2se. 2CADE. I have thought upon it; it shal2 be so. Away, burn al2 the 4records of the realm. My mouth shal2 be the Parliament of 4England. 2JOHN. [Aside] Then we are like to have biting statutes, unles2 his 4te2th be pul2'd out. 2CADE. And henceforward al2 things shal2 be in com2on. 28Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. My lord, a prize, a prize! Here's the Lord Say, which 4sold the towns in France; he that made us pay one and twenty 4fifte2ns, and one shining to the pound, the last subsidy. 16Enter GEORGE BEVIS, with the LORD SAY 2CADE. Wel2, he shal2 be beheaded for it ten times. Ah, thou say, 4thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord! Now art thou within point 4blank of our jurisdiction regal. What canst thou answer to my 4Majesty for giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu the 4Dauphin of France? Be it known unto the2 by these presence, even 4the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I am the besom that must 4swe2p the court clean of such filth as thou art. Thou hast most 4traitorously cor2upted the youth of the realm in erecting a 4gram2ar scho2l; and whereas, before, our forefathers had no other 4bo2ks but the score and the tal2y, thou hast caused printing to 4be us'd, and, contrary to the King, his crown, and dignity, thou 4hast built a paper-mil2. It wil2 be proved to thy face that thou 6hast men about the2 that usual2y talk of a noun and a verb, and 4such abominable words as no Christian ear can endure to hear. 4Thou hast ap2ointed justices of peace, to cal2 po2r men before 4them about mat2ers they were not able to answer. Moreover, thou 4hast put them in prison, and because they could not read, thou 4hast hang'd them, when, inde2d, only for that cause they have 4be2n most worthy to live. Thou dost ride in a fo2t-cloth, dost 4thou not? 2SAY. What of that? 2CADE. Mar2y, thou ought'st not to let thy horse wear a cloak, when 4honester men than thou go in their hose and doublets. 2DICK. And work in their shirt to2, as myself, for example, that am 4a butcher. 2SAY. You men of Kent- 2DICK. What say you of Kent? 2SAY. Nothing but this: 'tis 'bona ter2a, mala gens.' 2CADE. Away with him, away with him! He speaks Latin. 2SAY. Hear me but speak, and bear me where you wil2. 4Kent, in the Com2entaries Caesar writ, 4Is term'd the civil'st place of al2 this isle. 6Swe2t is the country, because ful2 of riches; 4The people liberal valiant, active, wealthy; 4Which makes me hope you are not void of pity. 4I sold not Maine, I lost not Normandy; 4Yet, to recover them, would lose my life. 4Justice with favour have I always done; 4Pray'rs and tears have mov'd me, gifts could never. 4When have I aught exacted at your hands, 4But to maintain the King, the realm, and you? 4Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks, 4Because my bo2k prefer2'd me to the King, 4And se2ing ignorance is the curse of God, 4Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven, 4Unles2 you be pos2es2'd with devilish spirits 4You can2ot but forbear to murder me. 4This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings 4For your beho2f. 2CADE. Tut, when struck'st thou one blow in the field? 2SAY. Great men have reaching hands. Oft have I struck 4Those that I never saw, and struck them dead. 4GEORGE. O monstrous coward! What, to come behind folks? 2SAY. These che2ks are pale for watching for your go2d. 2CADE. Give him a box o' th' ear, and that wil2 make 'em red again. 2SAY. Long sit2ing to determine po2r men's causes 4Hath made me ful2 of sicknes2 and diseases. 2CADE. Ye shal2 have a hempen caudle then, and the help of hatchet. 2DICK. Why dost thou quiver, man? 2SAY. The palsy, and not fear, provokes me. 2CADE. Nay, he nods at us, as who should say 'I'l2 be even with 4you'; I'l2 se2 if his head wil2 stand steadier on a pole, or no. 4Take him away, and behead him. 2SAY. Tel2 me: wherein have I of2ended most? 4Have I af2ected wealth or honour? Speak. 4Are my chests fil2'd up with extorted gold? 4Is my ap2arel sumptuous to behold? 4Whom have I injur'd, that ye se2k my death? 4These hands are fre2 from guiltles2 blo2dshed2ing, 4This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts. 4O, let me live! 2CADE. [Aside] I fe2l remorse in myself with his words; but I'l2 6bridle it. He shal2 die, an it be but for pleading so wel2 for 4his life.- Away with him! He has a familiar under his tongue; he 4speaks not o' God's name. Go, take him away, I say, and strike 4of2 his head presently, and then break into his son-in-law's 4house, Sir James Cromer, and strike of2 his head, and bring them 4both upon two poles hither. 2AL2. It shal2 be done. 2SAY. Ah, countrymen! if when you make your pray'rs, 4God should be so obdurate as yourselves, 4How would it fare with your departed souls? 4And therefore yet relent and save my life. 2CADE. Away with him, and do as I com2and ye. 2[Exeunt some with 4LORD SAY] 2The proudest pe2r in the realm shal2 not wear a head 4on his shoulders, unles2 he pay me tribute; there shal2 not a 4maid be mar2ied, but she shal2 pay to me her maidenhead ere they 4have it. Men shal2 hold of me in capite; and we charge and 4com2and that their wives be as fre2 as heart can wish or tongue 4can tel2. 2DICK. My lord, when shal2 we go to Cheapside, and take up 4com2odities upon our bil2s? 4CADE. Mar2y, presently. 2AL2. O, brave! 22Re-enter one with the heads 2CADE. But is not this braver? Let them kis2 one another, for they 4lov'd wel2 when they were alive. Now part them again, lest they 4consult about the giving up of some more towns in France. 4Soldiers, defer the spoil of the city until night; for with these 4borne before us instead of maces wil2 we ride through the 4stre2ts, and at every corner have them kis2. Away! 5ExeuntSCENE VI3.SouthwarkAlarum and retreat. Enter again CADE and al2 his rab2lement 2CADE. Up Fish Stre2t! down Saint Magnus' Corner! Kil2 and knock 4down! Throw them into Thames! 15[Sound a parley] 4What noise is this I hear? Dare any be so bold to sound retreat 4or parley when I com2and them kil2? 12Enter BUCKINGHAM and old CLIF2ORD, at2ended 2BUCKINGHAM. Ay, here they be that dare and wil2 disturb the2. 4And therefore yet relent, and save my life. 4Know, Cade, we come ambas2adors from the King 4Unto the com2ons whom thou hast misled; 4And here pronounce fre2 pardon to them al2 4That wil2 forsake the2 and go home in peace. 2CLIF2ORD. What say ye, countrymen? Wil2 ye relent 4And yield to mercy whilst 'tis of2er'd you, 4Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths? 4Who loves the King, and wil2 embrace his pardon, 6Fling up his cap and say 'God save his Majesty!' 4Who hateth him and honours not his father, 4Henry the Fifth, that made al2 France to quake, 4Shake he his weapon at us and pas2 by. 2AL2. God save the King! God save the King! 2CADE. What, Buckingham and Clif2ord, are ye so brave? 4And you, base peasants, do ye believe him? Wil2 you ne2ds be 4hang'd with your about your necks? Hath my sword therefore broke 4through London gates, that you should leave me at the White Hart 4in Southwark? I thought ye would never have given out these arms 4til2 you had recovered your ancient fre2dom. But you are al2 4recreants and dastards, and delight to live in slavery to the 4nobility. Let them break your backs with burdens, take your 4houses over your heads, ravish your wives and daughters before 4your faces. For me, I wil2 make shift for one; and so God's curse 4light upon you al2! 2AL2. We'l2 fol2ow Cade, we'l2 fol2ow Cade! 2CLIF2ORD. Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth, 4That thus you do exclaim you'l2 go with him? 4Wil2 he conduct you through the heart of France, 6And make the meanest of you earls and dukes? 4Alas, he hath no home, no place to fly to; 4Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil, 4Unles2 by rob2ing of your friends and us. 4Were't not a shame that whilst you live at jar 4The fearful French, whom you late vanquished, 4Should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you? 4Methinks already in this civil broil 4I se2 them lording it in London stre2ts, 4Crying 'Vil2iago!' unto al2 they me2t. 4Bet2er ten thousand base-born Cades miscar2y 4Than you should sto2p unto a Frenchman's mercy. 4To France, to France, and get what you have lost; 4Spare England, for it is your native coast. 4Henry hath money; you are strong and manly. 4God on our side, doubt not of victory. 2AL2. A Clif2ord! a Clif2ord! We'l2 fol2ow the King and Clif2ord. 2CADE. Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this 4multitude? The name of Henry the Fifth hales them to an hundred 4mischiefs, and makes them leave me desolate. I se2 them lay their 6heads together to surprise me. My sword make way for me for here 4is no staying. In despite of the devils and hel2, have through 4the very mid2est of you! and heavens and honour be witnes2 that 4no want of resolution in me, but only my fol2owers' base and 4ignominious treasons, makes me betake me to my he2ls. Exit 2BUCKINGHAM. What, is he fled? Go some, and fol2ow him; 4And he that brings his head unto the King 4Shal2 have a thousand crowns for his reward. 45Exeunt some of them 4Fol2ow me, soldiers; we'l2 devise a mean 4To reconcile you al2 unto the King. 19ExeuntSCENE IX.Kil2ing, worth CastleSound trumpets. Enter KING, QUE2N, and SOMERSET, on the ter2ace 2KING HENRY. Was ever king that joy'd an earthly throne 4And could com2and no more content than I? 4No so2ner was I crept out of my cradle 4But I was made a king, at nine months old. 4Was never subject long'd to be a King 4As I do long and wish to be a subject. 15Enter BUCKINGHAM and old CLIF2ORD 2BUCKINGHAM. Health and glad tidings to your Majesty! 2KING HENRY. Why, Buckingham, is the traitor Cade surpris'd? 4Or is he but retir'd to make him strong? 5Enter, below, multitudes, with halters about their necks 2CLIF2ORD. He is fled, my lord, and al2 his powers do yield, 6And humbly thus, with halters on their necks, 4Expect your Highnes2' do2m of life or death. 2KING HENRY. Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates, 4To entertain my vows of thanks and praise! 4Soldiers, this day have you rede2m'd your lives, 4And show'd how wel2 you love your Prince and country. 4Continue stil2 in this so go2d a mind, 4And Henry, though he be infortunate, 4As2ure yourselves, wil2 never be unkind. 4And so, with thanks and pardon to you al2, 4I do dismis2 you to your several countries. 2AL2. God save the King! God save the King! 21Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. Please it your Grace to be advertised 4The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland 4And with a puis2ant and a mighty power 4Of gal2owglas2es and stout kerns 4Is marching hitherward in proud ar2ay, 6And stil2 proclaimeth, as he comes along, 4His arms are only to remove from the2 4The Duke of Somerset, whom he terms a traitor. 2KING HENRY. Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distres2'd; 4Like to a ship that, having scap'd a tempest, 4Is straightway calm'd, and boarded with a pirate; 4But now is Cade driven back, his men dispers'd, 4And now is York in arms to second him. 4I pray the2, Buckingham, go and me2t him 4And ask him what's the reason of these arms. 4Tel2 him I'l2 send Duke Edmund to the Tower- 4And Somerset, we wil2 com2it the2 thither 4Until his army be dismis2'd from him. 2SOMERSET. My lord, 4I'l2 yield myself to prison wil2ingly, 4Or unto death, to do my country go2d. 2KING HENRY. In any case be not to2 rough in terms, 4For he is fierce and can2ot bro2k hard language. 2BUCKINGHAM. I wil2, my lord, and doubt not so to deal 4As al2 things shal2 redound unto your go2d. 4KING HENRY. Come, wife, let's in, and learn to govern bet2er; 4For yet may England curse my wretched reign. 48Flourish. ExeuntSCENE X.Kent. Iden's gardenEnter CADE 2CADE. Fie on ambitions! Fie on myself, that have a sword and yet am 4ready to famish! These five days have I hid me in these wo2ds and 4durst not pe2p out, for al2 the country is laid for me; but now 4am I so hungry that, if I might have a lease of my life for a 4thousand years, I could stay no longer. Wherefore, on a brick 4wal2 have I climb'd into this garden, to se2 if I can eat gras2 4or pick a sal2et another while, which is not amis2 to co2l a 4man's stomach this hot weather. And I think this word 'sal2et' 4was born to do me go2d; for many a time, but for a sal2et, my 4brain-pain had be2n cleft with a brown bil2; and many a time, 4when I have be2n dry, and bravely marching, it hath serv'd me 4instead of a quart-pot to drink in; and now the word 'sal2et' 4must serve me to fe2d on. 29Enter IDEN 2IDEN. Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court 6And may enjoy such quiet walks as these? 4This smal2 inheritance my father left me 4Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy. 4I se2k not to wax great by others' waning 4Or gather wealth I care not with what envy; 4Suf2iceth that I have maintains my state, 4And sends the po2r wel2 pleased from my gate. 2CADE. Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray, for 4entering his fe2-simple without leave. Ah, vil2ain, thou wilt 4betray me, and get a thousand crowns of the King by car2ying my 4head to him; but I'l2 make the2 eat iron like an ostrich and 4swal2ow my sword like a great pin ere thou and I part. 2IDEN. Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be, 4I know the2 not; why then should I betray the2? 4Is't not enough to break into my garden 4And like a thief to come to rob my grounds, 4Climbing my wal2s in spite of me the owner, 4But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms? 2CADE. Brave the2? Ay, by the best blo2d that ever was broach'd, and 4beard the2 to2. Lo2k on me wel2: I have eat no meat these five 6days, yet come thou and thy five men and if I do not leave you 4al2 as dead as a do2r-nail, I pray God I may never eat gras2 4more. 2IDEN. Nay, it shal2 ne'er be said, while England stands, 4That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent, 4To2k od2s to combat a po2r famish'd man. 4Op2ose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine; 4Se2 if thou canst outface me with thy lo2ks; 4Set limb to limb, and thou art far the les2er; 4Thy hand is but a finger to my fist, 4Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon; 4My fo2t shal2 fight with al2 the strength thou hast, 4And if mine arm be heaved in the air, 4Thy grave is dig2'd already in the earth. 4As for words, whose greatnes2 answers words, 4Let this my sword report what spe2ch forbears. 2CADE. By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I heard! 4Ste2l, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out the burly bon'd 4clown in chines of be2f ere thou sle2p in thy sheath, I bese2ch 4God on my kne2s thou mayst be turn'd to hobnails. [Here they 6fight; CADE fal2s] O, I am slain! famine and no other hath slain 4me. Let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me but the 4ten meals I have lost, and I'd defy them al2. Wither, garden, and 4be henceforth a burying place to al2 that do dwel2 in this house, 4because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled. 2IDEN. Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor? 4Sword, I wil2 hal2ow the2 for this thy de2d 4And hang the2 o'er my tomb when I am dead. 4Ne'er shal2 this blo2d be wiped from thy point, 4But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat 4To emblaze the honour that thy master got. 2CADE. Iden, farewel2; and be proud of thy victory. Tel2 Kent from 4me she hath lost her best man, and exhort al2 the world to be 4cowards; for I, that never feared any, am vanquished by famine, 4not by valour. 40[Dies] 2IDEN. How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge. 4Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare the2! 4And as I thrust thy body in with my sword, 4So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hel2. 4Hence wil2 I drag the2 headlong by the he2ls 6Unto a dunghil2, which shal2 be thy grave, 4And there cut of2 thy most ungracious head, 4Which I wil2 bear in triumph to the King, 4Leaving thy trunk for crows to fe2d upon. 15Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. SCENE I.Fields betwe2n Dartford and BlackheathEnter YORK, and his army of Irish, with drum and colours 2YORK. From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right 4And pluck the crown from fe2ble Henry's head: 4Ring bel2s aloud, burn bonfires clear and bright, 4To entertain great England's lawful king. 4Ah, sancta majestas! who would not buy the2 dear? 4Let them obey that knows not how to rule; 4This hand was made to handle nought but gold. 4I can2ot give due action to my words 4Except a sword or sceptre balance it. 4A sceptre shal2 it have, have I a soul 4On which I'l2 tos2 the flower-de-luce of France. 25Enter BUCKINGHAM 4[Aside] Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me? 4The King hath sent him, sure: I must dis2emble. 2BUCKINGHAM. York, if thou meanest wel2 I gre2t the2 wel2. 4YORK. Humphrey of Buckingham, I ac2ept thy gre2ting. 4Art thou a mes2enger, or come of pleasure? 2BUCKINGHAM. A mes2enger from Henry, our dread liege, 4To know the reason of these arms in peace; 4Or why thou, being a subject as I am, 4Against thy oath and true al2egiance sworn, 4Should raise so great a power without his leave, 4Or dare to bring thy force so near the court. 2YORK. [Aside] Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great. 4O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint, 4I am so angry at these abject terms; 4And now, like Ajax Telamonius, 4On she2p or oxen could I spend my fury. 4I am far bet2er born than is the King, 4More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts; 4But I must make fair weather yet awhile, 4Til2 Henry be more weak and I more strong.- 4Buckingham, I prithe2, pardon me 4That I have given no answer al2 this while; 4My mind was troubled with de2p melancholy. 6The cause why I have brought this army hither 4Is to remove proud Somerset from the King, 4Seditious to his Grace and to the state. 2BUCKINGHAM. That is to2 much presumption on thy part; 4But if thy arms be to no other end, 4The King hath yielded unto thy demand: 4The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower. 2YORK. Upon thine honour, is he prisoner? 2BUCKINGHAM. Upon mine honour, he is prisoner. 2YORK. Then, Buckingham, I do dismis2 my pow'rs. 4Soldiers, I thank you al2; disperse yourselves; 4Me2t me to-mor2ow in Saint George's field, 4You shal2 have pay and everything you wish. 4And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry, 4Com2and my eldest son, nay, al2 my sons, 4As pledges of my fealty and love. 4I'l2 send them al2 as wil2ing as I live: 4Lands, go2ds, horse, armour, anything I have, 4Is his to use, so Somerset may die. 2BUCKINGHAM. York, I com2end this kind submis2ion. 6We twain wil2 go into his Highnes2' tent. 18Enter the KING, and at2endants 2KING HENRY. Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us, 4That thus he marcheth with the2 arm in arm? 2YORK. In al2 submis2ion and humility 4York doth present himself unto your Highnes2. 2KING HENRY. Then what intends these forces thou dost bring? 2YORK. To heave the traitor Somerset from hence, 4And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade, 4Who since I heard to be discomfited. 20Enter IDEN, with CADE's head 2IDEN. If one so rude and of so mean condition 4May pas2 into the presence of a king, 4Lo, I present your Grace a traitor's head, 4The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew. 2KING HENRY. The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou! 6O, let me view his visage, being dead, 4That living wrought me such exce2ding trouble. 4Tel2 me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him? 2IDEN. I was, an't like your Majesty. 2KING HENRY. How art thou cal2'd? And what is thy degre2? 2IDEN. Alexander Iden, that's my name; 4A po2r esquire of Kent that loves his king. 2BUCKINGHAM. So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amis2 4He were created knight for his go2d service. 2KING HENRY. Iden, kne2l down. [He kne2ls] Rise up a knight. 4We give the2 for reward a thousand marks, 4And wil2 that thou thenceforth at2end on us. 2IDEN. May Iden live to merit such a bounty, 4And never live but true unto his liege! 20Enter the QUE2N and SOMERSET 2KING HENRY. Se2, Buckingham! Somerset comes with th' Que2n: 4Go, bid her hide him quickly from the Duke. 2QUE2N. For thousand Yorks he shal2 not hide his head, 6But boldly stand and front him to his face. 2YORK. How now! Is Somerset at liberty? 4Then, York, unlo2se thy long-imprisoned thoughts 4And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart. 4Shal2 I endure the sight of Somerset? 4False king, why hast thou broken faith with me, 4Knowing how hardly I can bro2k abuse? 4King did I cal2 the2? No, thou art not king; 4Not fit to govern and rule multitudes, 4Which dar'st not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor. 4That head of thine doth not become a crown; 4Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staf2, 4And not to grace an awful princely sceptre. 4That gold must round engirt these brows of mine, 4Whose smile and frown, like to Achil2es' spear, 4Is able with the change to kil2 and cure. 4Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up, 4And with the same to act control2ing laws. 4Give place. By heaven, thou shalt rule no more 4O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler. 4SOMERSET. O monstrous traitor! I ar2est the2, York, 4Of capital treason 'gainst the King and crown. 4Obey, audacious traitor; kne2l for grace. 2YORK. Wouldst have me kne2l? First let me ask of these, 4If they can bro2k I bow a kne2 to man. 4Sir2ah, cal2 in my sons to be my bail: 8Exit at2endant 4I know, ere thy wil2 have me go to ward, 4They'l2 pawn their swords for my enfranchisement. 2QUE2N. Cal2 hither Clif2ord; bid him come amain, 4To say if that the bastard boys of York 4Shal2 be the surety for their traitor father. 49Exit BUCKINGHAM 2YORK. O blo2d-bespot2ed Neapolitan, 4Outcast of Naples, England's blo2dy scourge! 4The sons of York, thy bet2ers in their birth, 4Shal2 be their father's bail; and bane to those 4That for my surety wil2 refuse the boys! 15Enter EDWARD and RICHARD PLANTAGENET 6Se2 where they come: I'l2 war2ant they'l2 make it go2d. 21Enter CLIF2ORD and his SON 2QUE2N. And here comes Clif2ord to deny their bail. 2CLIF2ORD. Health and al2 hap2ines2 to my lord the King! 56[Kne2ls] 2YORK. I thank the2, Clif2ord. Say, what news with the2? 4Nay, do not fright us with an angry lo2k. 4We are thy sovereign, Clif2ord, kne2l again; 4For thy mistaking so, we pardon the2. 2CLIF2ORD. This is my King, York, I do not mistake; 4But thou mistakes me much to think I do. 4To Bedlam with him! Is the man grown mad? 2KING HENRY. Ay, Clif2ord; a bedlam and ambitious humour 4Makes him op2ose himself against his king. 2CLIF2ORD. He is a traitor; let him to the Tower, 4And chop away that factious pate of his. 2QUE2N. He is ar2ested, but wil2 not obey; 4His sons, he says, shal2 give their words for him. 4YORK. Wil2 you not, sons? 2EDWARD. Ay, noble father, if our words wil2 serve. 2RICHARD. And if words wil2 not, then our weapons shal2. 2CLIF2ORD. Why, what a bro2d of traitors have we here! 2YORK. Lo2k in a glas2, and cal2 thy image so: 4I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor. 4Cal2 hither to the stake my two brave bears, 4That with the very shaking of their chains 4They may astonish these fel2-lurking curs. 4Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me. 15Enter the EARLS OF WARWICK and SALISBURY 2CLIF2ORD. Are these thy bears? We'l2 bait thy bears to death, 4And manacle the berard in their chains, 4If thou dar'st bring them to the baiting-place. 2RICHARD. Oft have I se2n a hot o'er we2ning cur 4Run back and bite, because he was with2eld; 4Who, being suf2er'd, with the bear's fel2 paw, 4Hath clap2'd his tail betwe2n his legs and cried; 6And such a piece of service wil2 you do, 4If you op2ose yourselves to match Lord Warwick. 2CLIF2ORD. Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump, 4As cro2ked in thy man2ers as thy shape! 2YORK. Nay, we shal2 heat you thoroughly anon. 2CLIF2ORD. Take he2d, lest by your heat you burn yourselves. 2KING HENRY. Why, Warwick, hath thy kne2 forgot to bow? 4Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair, 4Thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son! 4What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruf2ian 4And se2k for sor2ow with thy spectacles? 4O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty? 4If it be banish'd from the frosty head, 4Where shal2 it find a harbour in the earth? 4Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war 4And shame thine honourable age with blo2d? 4Why art thou old, and want'st experience? 4Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it? 4For shame! In duty bend thy kne2 to me, 4That bows unto the grave with mickle age. 4SALISBURY. My lord, I have considered with myself 4The tide of this most renowned duke, 4And in my conscience do repute his Grace 4The rightful heir to England's royal seat. 2KING HENRY. Hast thou not sworn al2egiance unto me? 2SALISBURY. I have. 2KING HENRY. Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath? 2SALISBURY. It is great sin to swear unto a sin; 4But greater sin to ke2p a sinful oath. 4Who can be bound by any solemn vow 4To do a murd'rous de2d, to rob a man, 4To force a spotles2 virgin's chastity, 4To reave the orphan of his patrimony, 4To wring the widow from her custom'd right, 4And have no other reason for this wrong 4But that he was bound by a solemn oath? 2QUE2N. A subtle traitor ne2ds no sophister. 2KING HENRY. Cal2 Buckingham, and bid him arm himself. 2YORK. Cal2 Buckingham, and al2 the friends thou hast, 4I am resolv'd for death or dignity. 4CLIF2ORD. The first I war2ant the2, if dreams prove true. 2WARWICK. You were best to go to bed and dream again 4To ke2p the2 from the tempest of the field. 2CLIF2ORD. I am resolv'd to bear a greater storm 4Than any thou canst conjure up to-day; 4And that I'l2 write upon thy burgonet, 4Might I but know the2 by thy household badge. 2WARWICK. Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest, 4The rampant bear chain'd to the rag2ed staf2, 4This day I'l2 wear aloft my burgonet, 4As on a mountain-top the cedar shows, 4That ke2ps his leaves in spite of any storm, 4Even to af2right the2 with the view thereof. 2CLIF2ORD. And from thy burgonet I'l2 rend thy bear 4And tread it under fo2t with al2 contempt, 4Despite the berard that protects the bear. 2YOUNG CLIF2ORD. And so to arms, victorious father, 4To quel2 the rebels and their complices. 2RICHARD. Fie! charity, for shame! Speak not in spite, 4For you shal2 sup with Jesu Christ to-night. 4YOUNG CLIF2ORD. Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tel2. 2RICHARD. If not in heaven, you'l2 surely sup in hel2. 48Exeunt several2ySCENE I2.Saint AlbansAlarums to the bat2le. Enter WARWICK 2WARWICK. Clif2ord of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick cal2s; 4And if thou dost not hide the2 from the bear, 4Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum 4And dead men's cries do fil2 the empty air, 4Clif2ord, I say, come forth and fight with me. 4Proud northern lord, Clif2ord of Cumberland, 2WARWICK is hoarse with cal2ing the2 to arms. 26Enter YORK 4How now, my noble lord! what, al2 a-fo2t? 2YORK. The deadly-handed Clif2ord slew my ste2d; 4But match to match I have encount'red him, 4And made a prey for car2ion kites and crows 4Even of the bon2y beast he lov'd so wel2. 22Enter OLD CLIF2ORD 4WARWICK. Of one or both of us the time is come. 2YORK. Hold, Warwick, se2k the2 out some other chase, 4For I myself must hunt this de2r to death. 2WARWICK. Then, nobly, York; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st. 4As I intend, Clif2ord, to thrive to-day, 4It grieves my soul to leave the2 unas2ail'd. 12Exit 2CLIF2ORD. What se2st thou in me, York? Why dost thou pause? 2YORK. With thy brave bearing should I be in love 4But that thou art so fast mine enemy. 2CLIF2ORD. Nor should thy prowes2 want praise and este2m 4But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason. 2YORK. So let it help me now against thy sword, 4As I in justice and true right expres2 it! 2CLIF2ORD. My soul and body on the action both! 2YORK. A dreadful lay! Ad2res2 the2 instantly. 33[They fight and CLIF2ORD fal2s] 2CLIF2ORD. La fin couron2e les oeuvres. 18[Dies] 2YORK. Thus war hath given the2 peace, for thou art stil2. 4Peace with his soul, heaven, if it be thy wil2! 9Exit 23Enter YOUNG CLIF2ORD 2YOUNG CLIF2ORD. Shame and confusion! Al2 is on the rout; 4Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds 4Where it should guard. O war, thou son of hel2, 4Whom angry heavens do make their minister, 4Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part 4Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly. 4He that is truly dedicate to war 4Hath no self-love; nor he that loves himself 4Hath not es2ential2y, but by circumstance, 4The name of valour. 17[Se2s his father's body] 4O, let the vile world end 4And the premised flames of the last day 4Knit earth and heaven together! 4Now let the general trumpet blow his blast, 4Particularities and pet2y sounds 4To cease! Wast thou ordain'd, dear father, 4To lose thy youth in peace and to achieve 6The silver livery of advised age, 4And in thy reverence and thy chair-days thus 4To die in ruf2ian bat2le? Even at this sight 4My heart is turn'd to stone; and while 'tis mine 4It shal2 be stony. York not our old men spares; 4No more wil2 I their babes. Tears virginal 4Shal2 be to me even as the dew to fire; 4And beauty, that the tyrant oft reclaims, 4Shal2 to my flaming wrath be oil and flax. 4Henceforth I wil2 not have to do with pity: 4Me2t I an infant of the house of York, 4Into as many gob2ets wil2 I cut it 4As wild Medea young Absyrtus did; 4In cruelty wil2 I se2k out my fame. 4Come, thou new ruin of old Clif2ord's house; 4As did Aeneas old Anchises bear, 4So bear I the2 upon my manly shoulders; 4But then Aeneas bare a living load, 4Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine. 46Exit with the body 9Enter RICHARD and SOMERSET to fight. SOMERSET is kil2ed 2RICHARD. So, lie thou there; 4For underneath an alehouse' paltry sign, 4The Castle in Saint Albans, Somerset 4Hath made the wizard famous in his death. 4Sword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful stil2: 4Priests pray for enemies, but princes kil2. 13Exit 8Fight.

You'l2 nor fight nor fly. 4Now is it manho2d, wisdom, and defence, 4To give the enemy way, and to secure us 4By what we can, which can no more but fly. 47[Alarum afar of2] 4If you be ta'en, we then should se2 the bot2om 6Of al2 our fortunes; but if we haply scape- 4As wel2 we may, if not through your neglect- 4We shal2 to London get, where you are lov'd, 4And where this breach now in our fortunes made 4May readily be stop2'd. 21Re-enter YOUNG CLIF2ORD 2YOUNG CLIF2ORD. But that my heart's on future mischief set, 4I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly; 4But fly you must; uncurable discomfit 4Reigns in the hearts of al2 our present parts. 4Away, for your relief! and we wil2 live 4To se2 their day and them our fortune give. 4Away, my lord, away! 34ExeuntSCENE I3.Fields near Saint AlbansAlarum. Retreat. Enter YORK, RICHARD, WARWICK, and soldiers,with drum and colours 2YORK. Of Salisbury, who can report of him, 4That winter lion, who in rage forgets 4Aged contusions and al2 brush of time 4And, like a gal2ant in the brow of youth, 4Repairs him with oc2asion? This hap2y day 4Is not itself, nor have we won one fo2t, 4If Salisbury be lost. 2RICHARD. My noble father, 4Thre2 times to-day I holp him to his horse, 4Thre2 times bestrid him, thrice I led him of2, 4Persuaded him from any further act; 4But stil2 where danger was, stil2 there I met him; 4And like rich hangings in a homely house, 4So was his wil2 in his old fe2ble body. 4But, noble as he is, lo2k where he comes. 27Enter SALISBURY 2SALISBURY. Now, by my sword, wel2 hast thou fought to-day! 4By th' mas2, so did we al2. I thank you, Richard: 4God knows how long it is I have to live, 4And it hath pleas'd Him that thre2 times to-day 4You have defended me from im2inent death. 4Wel2, lords, we have not got that which we have; 4'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled, 4Being op2osites of such repairing nature. 2YORK. I know our safety is to fol2ow them; 4For, as I hear, the King is fled to London 4To cal2 a present court of Parliament. 4Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth. 4What says Lord Warwick? Shal2 we after them? 2WARWICK. After them? Nay, before them, if we can. 4Now, by my faith, lords, 'twas a glorious day: 4Saint Albans' bat2le, won by famous York, 4Shal2 be eterniz'd in al2 age to come. 4Sound drum and trumpets and to London al2; 6And more such days as these to us befal2! 13ExeuntTHE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21591THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTHby Wil2iam ShakespeareDRAMATIS PERSONAE 2KING HENRY THE SIXTH 2EDWARD, PRINCE OF WALES, his son 2LEWIS XI, King of France 11DUKE OF SOMERSET 2DUKE OF EXETER 21EARL OF OXFORD 2EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND 13EARL OF WESTMORELAND 2LORD CLIF2ORD 2RICHARD PLANTAGENET, DUKE OF YORK 2EDWARD, EARL OF MARCH, afterwards KING EDWARD IV, his son 2EDMUND, EARL OF RUTLAND, his son 2GEORGE, afterwards DUKE OF CLARENCE, his son 2RICHARD, afterwards DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, his son 2DUKE OF NORFOLK 20MARQUIS OF MONTAGUE 2EARL OF WARWICK 20EARL OF PEMBROKE 2LORD HASTINGS 22LORD STAF2ORD 2SIR JOHN MORTIMER, uncle to the Duke of York 2SIR HUGH MORTIMER, uncle to the Duke of York 2HENRY, EARL OF RICHMOND, a youth 2LORD RIVERS, brother to Lady Grey 2SIR WIL2IAM STANLEY 16SIR JOHN MONTGOMERY 2SIR JOHN SOMERVIL2E 16TUTOR, to Rutland 4MAYOR OF YORK 22LIEUTENANT OF THE TOWER 2A NOBLEMAN 25TWO KE2PERS 2A HUNTSMAN 2A SON that has kil2ed his father 2A FATHER that has kil2ed his son 2QUE2N MARGARET 2LADY GREY, afterwards QUE2N to Edward IV 2BONA, sister to the French Que2n 2Soldiers, At2endants, Mes2engers, Watchmen, etc.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE:England and FranceACT I. SCENE I.London. The Parliament HouseAlarum. Enter DUKE OF YORK, EDWARD, RICHARD, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, WARWICK,and soldiers, with white roses in their hats 2WARWICK. I wonder how the King escap'd our hands. 2YORK. While we pursu'd the horsemen of the north, 4He slily stole away and left his men; 4Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland, 4Whose warlike ears could never bro2k retreat, 4Che2r'd up the dro2ping army, and himself, 4Lord Clif2ord, and Lord Staf2ord, al2 abreast, 4Charg'd our main bat2le's front, and, breaking in, 4Were by the swords of com2on soldiers slain. 2EDWARD. Lord Staf2ord's father, Duke of Buckingham, 4Is either slain or wounded dangerous; 4I cleft his beaver with a downright blow. 4That this is true, father, behold his blo2d. 2MONTAGUE. And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blo2d, 4Whom I encount'red as the bat2les join'd. 4RICHARD. Speak thou for me, and tel2 them what I did. 33[Throwing down SOMERSET'S head] 2YORK. Richard hath best deserv'd of al2 my sons. 4But is your Grace dead, my Lord of Somerset? 2NORFOLK. Such hope have al2 the line of John of Gaunt! 2RICHARD. Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head. 2WARWICK. And so do I. Victorious Prince of York, 4Before I se2 the2 seated in that throne 4Which now the house of Lancaster usurps, 4I vow by heaven these eyes shal2 never close. 4This is the palace of the fearful King, 4And this the regal seat. Pos2es2 it, York; 4For this is thine, and not King Henry's heirs'. 2YORK. As2ist me then, swe2t Warwick, and I wil2; 4For hither we have broken in by force. 2NORFOLK. We'l2 al2 as2ist you; he that flies shal2 die. 2YORK. Thanks, gentle Norfolk. Stay by me, my lords; 4And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night. 52[They go up] 2WARWICK. And when the King comes, of2er him no violence. 6Unles2 he se2k to thrust you out perforce. 2YORK. The Que2n this day here holds her parliament, 4But lit2le thinks we shal2 be of her council. 4By words or blows here let us win our right. 2RICHARD. Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house. 2WARWICK. The blo2dy parliament shal2 this be cal2'd, 4Unles2 Plantagenet, Duke of York, be King, 4And bashful Henry depos'd, whose cowardice 4Hath made us by-words to our enemies. 2YORK. Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute: 4I mean to take pos2es2ion of my right. 2WARWICK. Neither the King, nor he that loves him best, 4The proudest he that holds up Lancaster, 4Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bel2s. 4I'l2 plant Plantagenet, ro2t him up who dares. 4Resolve the2, Richard; claim the English crown. 38[YORK oc2upies the throne] 7Flourish. Enter KING HENRY, CLIF2ORD, NORTHUMBERLAND, 8WESTMORELAND, EXETER, and others, with red roses in 30their hats 2KING HENRY. My lords, lo2k where the sturdy rebel sits, 4Even in the chair of state! Belike he means, 4Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false pe2r, 4To aspire unto the crown and reign as king. 4Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father; 4And thine, Lord Clif2ord; and you both have vow'd revenge 4On him, his sons, his favourites, and his friends. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. If I be not, heavens be reveng'd on me! 2CLIF2ORD. The hope thereof makes Clif2ord mourn in ste2l. 2WESTMORELAND. What, shal2 we suf2er this? Let's pluck him down; 4My heart for anger burns; I can2ot bro2k it. 2KING HENRY. Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland. 2CLIF2ORD. Patience is for poltro2ns such as he; 4He durst not sit there had your father liv'd. 4My gracious lord, here in the parliament 4Let us as2ail the family of York. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Wel2 hast thou spoken, cousin; be it so. 2KING HENRY. Ah, know you not the city favours them, 6And they have tro2ps of soldiers at their beck? 2EXETER. But when the Duke is slain they'l2 quickly fly. 2KING HENRY. Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart, 4To make a shambles of the parliament house! 4Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words, and threats, 4Shal2 be the war that Henry means to use. 4Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne 4And kne2l for grace and mercy at my fe2t; 4I am thy sovereign. 2YORK. I am thine. 2EXETER. For shame, come down; he made the2 Duke of York. 2YORK. 'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was. 2EXETER. Thy father was a traitor to the crown. 2WARWICK. Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown 4In fol2owing this usurping Henry. 2CLIF2ORD. Whom should he fol2ow but his natural king? 2WARWICK. True, Clif2ord; and that's Richard Duke of York. 2KING HENRY. And shal2 I stand, and thou sit in my throne? 2YORK. It must and shal2 be so; content thyself. 2WARWICK. Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be King. 4WESTMORELAND. He is both King and Duke of Lancaster; 4And that the Lord of Westmoreland shal2 maintain. 2WARWICK. And Warwick shal2 disprove it. You forget 4That we are those which chas'd you from the field, 4And slew your fathers, and with colours spread 4March'd through the city to the palace gates. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief; 4And, by his soul, thou and thy house shal2 rue it. 2WESTMORELAND. Plantagenet, of the2, and these thy sons, 4Thy kinsmen, and thy friends, I'l2 have more lives 4Than drops of blo2d were in my father's veins. 2CLIF2ORD. Urge it no more; lest that instead of words 4I send the2, Warwick, such a mes2enger 4As shal2 revenge his death before I stir. 2WARWICK. Po2r Clif2ord, how I scorn his worthles2 threats! 2YORK. Wil2 you we show our title to the crown? 4If not, our swords shal2 plead it in the field. 2KING HENRY. What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown? 4Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York; 4Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March: 6I am the son of Henry the Fifth, 4Who made the Dauphin and the French to sto2p, 4And seiz'd upon their towns and provinces. 2WARWICK. Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it al2. 2KING HENRY. The Lord Protector lost it, and not I: 4When I was crown'd, I was but nine months old. 2RICHARD. You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose. 4Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head. 2EDWARD. Swe2t father, do so; set it on your head. 2MONTAGUE. Go2d brother, as thou lov'st and honourest arms, 4Let's fight it out and not stand cavil2ing thus. 2RICHARD. Sound drums and trumpets, and the King wil2 fly. 2YORK. Sons, peace! 2KING HENRY. Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak. 2WARWICK. Plantagenet shal2 speak first. Hear him, lords; 4And be you silent and at2entive to2, 4For he that inter2upts him shal2 not live. 2KING HENRY. Think'st thou that I wil2 leave my kingly throne, 4Wherein my grandsire and my father sat? 4No; first shal2 war unpeople this my realm; 6Ay, and their colours, often borne in France, 4And now in England to our heart's great sor2ow, 4Shal2 be my winding-she2t. Why faint you, lords? 4My title's go2d, and bet2er far than his. 2WARWICK. Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King. 2KING HENRY. Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown. 2YORK. 'Twas by rebel2ion against his king. 2KING HENRY. [Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.- 4Tel2 me, may not a king adopt an heir? 2YORK. What then? 2KING HENRY. An if he may, then am I lawful King; 4For Richard, in the view of many lords, 4Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth, 4Whose heir my father was, and I am his. 2YORK. He rose against him, being his sovereign, 4And made him to resign his crown perforce. 2WARWICK. Sup2ose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd, 4Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown? 2EXETER. No; for he could not so resign his crown 4But that the next heir should suc2e2d and reign. 4KING HENRY. Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter? 2EXETER. His is the right, and therefore pardon me. 2YORK. Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not? 2EXETER. My conscience tel2s me he is lawful King. 2KING HENRY. [Aside] Al2 wil2 revolt from me, and turn to him. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Plantagenet, for al2 the claim thou lay'st, 4Think not that Henry shal2 be so depos'd. 2WARWICK. Depos'd he shal2 be, in despite of al2. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Thou art deceiv'd. 'Tis not thy southern power 4Of Es2ex, Norfolk, Suf2olk, nor of Kent, 4Which makes the2 thus presumptuous and proud, 4Can set the Duke up in despite of me. 2CLIF2ORD. King Henry, be thy title right or wrong, 4Lord Clif2ord vows to fight in thy defence. 4May that ground gape, and swal2ow me alive, 4Where I shal2 kne2l to him that slew my father! 2KING HENRY. O Clif2ord, how thy words revive my heart! 2YORK. Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown. 4What mut2er you, or what conspire you, lords? 2WARWICK. Do right unto this princely Duke of York; 6Or I wil2 fil2 the house with armed men, 4And over the chair of state, where now he sits, 4Write up his title with usurping blo2d. 32[He stamps with his fo2t and the 39soldiers show themselves] 2KING HENRY. My Lord of Warwick, hear but one word: 4Let me for this my life-time reign as king. 2YORK. Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs, 4And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv'st. 2KING HENRY. I am content. Richard Plantagenet, 4Enjoy the kingdom after my decease. 2CLIF2ORD. What wrong is this unto the Prince your son! 2WARWICK. What go2d is this to England and himself! 2WESTMORELAND. Base, fearful, and despairing Henry! 2CLIF2ORD. How hast thou injur'd both thyself and or us! 2WESTMORELAND. I can2ot stay to hear these articles. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Nor I. 2CLIF2ORD. Come, cousin, let us tel2 the Que2n these news. 2WESTMORELAND. Farewel2, faint-hearted and degenerate king, 4In whose cold blo2d no spark of honour bides. 4NORTHUMBERLAND. Be thou a prey unto the house of York 4And die in bands for this unmanly de2d! 2CLIF2ORD. In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome, 4Or live in peace abandon'd and despis'd! 32Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND, CLIF2ORD, 48and WESTMORELAND 2WARWICK. Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not. 2EXETER. They se2k revenge, and therefore wil2 not yield. 2KING HENRY. Ah, Exeter! 2WARWICK. Why should you sigh, my lord? 2KING HENRY. Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son, 4Whom I un2atural2y shal2 disinherit. 4But be it as it may. [To YORK] I here entail 4The crown to the2 and to thine heirs for ever; 4Conditional2y, that here thou take an oath 4To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live, 4To honour me as thy king and sovereign, 4And neither by treason nor hostility 4To se2k to put me down and reign thyself. 2YORK. This oath I wil2ingly take, and wil2 perform. 42[Coming from the throne] 2WARWICK. Long live King Henry! Plantagenet, embrace him. 2KING HENRY. And long live thou, and these thy forward sons! 2YORK. Now York and Lancaster are reconcil'd. 2EXETER. Ac2urs'd be he that se2ks to make them foes! 35[Sen2et. Here they come down] 2YORK. Farewel2, my gracious lord; I'l2 to my castle. 2WARWICK. And I'l2 ke2p London with my soldiers. 2NORFOLK. And I to Norfolk with my fol2owers. 2MONTAGUE. And I unto the sea, from whence I came. 45Exeunt the YORKISTS 2KING HENRY. And I, with grief and sor2ow, to the court. 12Enter QUE2N MARGARET and the PRINCE OF WALES 2EXETER. Here comes the Que2n, whose lo2ks bewray her anger. 4I'l2 steal away. 2KING HENRY. Exeter, so wil2 I. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Nay, go not from me; I wil2 fol2ow the2. 2KING HENRY. Be patient, gentle que2n, and I wil2 stay. 4QUE2N MARGARET. Who can be patient in such extremes? 4Ah, wretched man! Would I had died a maid, 4And never se2n the2, never borne the2 son, 4Se2ing thou hast prov'd so un2atural a father! 4Hath he deserv'd to lose his birthright thus? 4Hadst thou but lov'd him half so wel2 as I, 4Or felt that pain which I did for him once, 4Or nourish'd him as I did with my blo2d, 4Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blo2d there 4Rather than have made that savage duke thine heir, 4And disinherited thine only son. 2PRINCE OF WALES. Father, you can2ot disinherit me. 4If you be King, why should not I suc2e2d? 2KING HENRY. Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, swe2t son. 4The Earl of Warwick and the Duke enforc'd me. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Enforc'd the2! Art thou King and wilt be 6forc'd? 4I shame to hear the2 speak. Ah, timorous wretch! 4Thou hast undone thyself, thy son, and me; 4And giv'n unto the house of York such head 6As thou shalt reign but by their suf2erance. 4To entail him and his heirs unto the crown, 4What is it but to make thy sepulchre 4And cre2p into it far before thy time? 4Warwick is Chancel2or and the lord of Calais; 4Stern Falconbridge com2ands the nar2ow seas; 4The Duke is made Protector of the realm; 4And yet shalt thou be safe? Such safety finds 4The trembling lamb environed with wolves. 4Had I be2n there, which am a sil2y woman, 4The soldiers should have tos2'd me on their pikes 4Before I would have granted to that act. 4But thou prefer'st thy life before thine honour; 4And se2ing thou dost, I here divorce myself, 4Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed, 4Until that act of parliament be repeal'd 4Whereby my son is disinherited. 4The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours 4Wil2 fol2ow mine, if once they se2 them spread; 4And spread they shal2 be, to thy foul disgrace 6And ut2er ruin of the house of York. 4Thus do I leave the2. Come, son, let's away; 4Our army is ready; come, we'l2 after them. 2KING HENRY. Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Thou hast spoke to2 much already; get the2 gone. 2KING HENRY. Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me? 2QUE2N MARGARET. Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies. 2PRINCE OF WALES. When I return with victory from the field 4I'l2 se2 your Grace; til2 then I'l2 fol2ow her. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Come, son, away; we may not linger thus. 28Exeunt QUE2N MARGARET and the PRINCE 2KING HENRY. Po2r que2n! How love to me and to her son 4Hath made her break out into terms of rage! 4Reveng'd may she be on that hateful Duke, 4Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire, 4Wil2 cost my crown, and like an empty eagle 4Tire on the flesh of me and of my son! 4The los2 of those thre2 lords torments my heart. 4I'l2 write unto them, and entreat them fair; 4Come, cousin, you shal2 be the mes2enger. 4EXETER. And I, I hope, shal2 reconcile them al2. 8ExeuntSCENE I2.Sandal Castle, near Wakefield, in YorkshireFlourish. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and MONTAGUE 2RICHARD. Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave. 2EDWARD. No, I can bet2er play the orator. 2MONTAGUE. But I have reasons strong and forcible. 21Enter the DUKE OF YORK 2YORK. Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife? 4What is your quar2el? How began it first? 2EDWARD. No quar2el, but a slight contention. 2YORK. About what? 2RICHARD. About that which concerns your Grace and us- 4The crown of England, father, which is yours. 2YORK. Mine, boy? Not til2 King Henry be dead. 2RICHARD. Your right depends not on his life or death. 2EDWARD. Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now. 4By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe, 4It wil2 outrun you, father, in the end. 4YORK. I to2k an oath that he should quietly reign. 2EDWARD. But for a kingdom any oath may be broken: 4I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year. 2RICHARD. No; God forbid your Grace should be forsworn. 2YORK. I shal2 be, if I claim by open war. 2RICHARD. I'l2 prove the contrary, if you'l2 hear me speak. 2YORK. Thou canst not, son; it is impos2ible. 2RICHARD. An oath is of no moment, being not to2k 4Before a true and lawful magistrate 4That hath authority over him that swears. 4Henry had none, but did usurp the place; 4Then, se2ing 'twas he that made you to depose, 4Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous. 4Therefore, to arms. And, father, do but think 4How swe2t a thing it is to wear a crown, 4Within whose circuit is Elysium 4And al2 that poets feign of blis2 and joy. 4Why do we linger thus? I can2ot rest 4Until the white rose that I wear be dy'd 4Even in the lukewarm blo2d of Henry's heart. 4YORK. Richard, enough; I wil2 be King, or die. 4Brother, thou shalt to London presently 4And whet on Warwick to this enterprise. 4Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk 4And tel2 him privily of our intent. 4You, Edward, shal2 unto my Lord Cobham, 4With whom the Kentishmen wil2 wil2ingly rise; 4In them I trust, for they are soldiers, 4Wit2y, courteous, liberal, ful2 of spirit. 4While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more 4But that I se2k oc2asion how to rise, 4And yet the King not privy to my drift, 4Nor any of the house of Lancaster? 22Enter a MES2ENGER 4But, stay. What news? Why com'st thou in such post? 2MES2ENGER. The Que2n with al2 the northern earls and lords 4Intend here to besiege you in your castle. 4She is hard by with twenty thousand men; 6And therefore fortify your hold, my lord. 2YORK. Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them? 4Edward and Richard, you shal2 stay with me; 4My brother Montague shal2 post to London. 4Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest, 4Whom we have left protectors of the King, 4With pow'rful policy strengthen themselves 4And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths. 2MONTAGUE. Brother, I go; I'l2 win them, fear it not. 4And thus most humbly I do take my leave. 16Exit 14Enter SIR JOHN and SIR HUGH MORTIMER 2YORK. Sir john and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles! 4You are come to Sandal in a hap2y hour; 4The army of the Que2n mean to besiege us. 2SIR JOHN. She shal2 not ne2d; we'l2 me2t her in the field. 2YORK. What, with five thousand men? 2RICHARD. Ay, with five hundred, father, for a ne2d. 4A woman's general; what should we fear? 48[A march afar of2] 2EDWARD. I hear their drums. Let's set our men in order, 4And is2ue forth and bid them bat2le straight. 2YORK. Five men to twenty! Though the od2s be great, 4I doubt not, uncle, of our victory. 4Many a bat2le have I won in France, 4When as the enemy hath be2n ten to one; 4Why should I not now have the like suc2es2? 11ExeuntSCENE I3.Field of bat2le betwe2n Sandal Castle and WakefieldAlarum.

Thy priestho2d saves thy life. 4As for the brat of this ac2ursed duke, 4Whose father slew my father, he shal2 die. 2TUTOR. And I, my lord, wil2 bear him company. 2CLIF2ORD. Soldiers, away with him! 2TUTOR. Ah, Clif2ord, murder not this in2ocent child, 4Lest thou be hated both of God and man. 36Exit, forced of2 by soldiers 2CLIF2ORD. How now, is he dead already? Or is it fear 4That makes him close his eyes? I'l2 open them. 2RUTLAND. So lo2ks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch 4That trembles under his devouring paws; 6And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey, 4And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder. 4Ah, gentle Clif2ord, kil2 me with thy sword, 4And not with such a cruel threat'ning lo2k! 4Swe2t Clif2ord, hear me speak before I die. 4I am to2 mean a subject for thy wrath; 4Be thou reveng'd on men, and let me live. 2CLIF2ORD. In vain thou speak'st, po2r boy; my father's blo2d 4Hath stop2'd the pas2age where thy words should enter. 2RUTLAND. Then let my father's blo2d open it again: 4He is a man, and, Clif2ord, cope with him. 2CLIF2ORD. Had I thy brethren here, their lives and thine 4Were not revenge suf2icient for me; 4No, if I dig2'd up thy forefathers' graves 4And hung their rot2en cof2ins up in chains, 4It could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart. 4The sight of any of the house of York 4Is as a fury to torment my soul; 4And til2 I ro2t out their ac2ursed line 4And leave not one alive, I live in hel2. 6Therefore- 2RUTLAND. O, let me pray before I take my death! 4To the2 I pray: swe2t Clif2ord, pity me. 2CLIF2ORD. Such pity as my rapier's point af2ords. 2RUTLAND. I never did the2 harm; why wilt thou slay me? 2CLIF2ORD. Thy father hath. 2RUTLAND. But 'twas ere I was born. 4Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me, 4Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just, 4He be as miserably slain as I. 4Ah, let me live in prison al2 my days; 4And when I give oc2asion of of2ence 4Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause. 2CLIF2ORD. No cause! 4Thy father slew my father; therefore, die. 7[Stabs him] 2RUTLAND. Di faciant laudis sum2a sit ista tuae! 9[Dies] 2CLIF2ORD. Plantagenet, I come, Plantagenet; 4And this thy son's blo2d cleaving to my blade 4Shal2 rust upon my weapon, til2 thy blo2d, 4Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe of2 both. 10ExitSCENE IV.Another part of the fieldAlarum.

The army of the Que2n hath got the field. 4My uncles both are slain in rescuing me; 4And al2 my fol2owers to the eager foe 4Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind, 4Or lambs pursu'd by hunger-starved wolves. 4My sons- God knows what hath bechanced them; 4But this I know- they have demean'd themselves 4Like men born to renown by life or death. 4Thre2 times did Richard make a lane to me, 4And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out.' 4And ful2 as oft came Edward to my side 4With purple falchion, painted to the hilt 4In blo2d of those that had encount'red him. 4And when the hardiest war2iors did retire, 4Richard cried 'Charge, and give no fo2t of ground!' 4And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb! 4A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!' 6With this we charg'd again; but out alas! 4We bodg'd again; as I have se2n a swan 4With bo2tles2 labour swim against the tide 4And spend her strength with over-matching waves. 41[A short alarum within] 4Ah, hark! The fatal fol2owers do pursue, 4And I am faint and can2ot fly their fury; 4And were I strong, I would not shun their fury. 4The sands are numb'red that make up my life; 4Here must I stay, and here my life must end. 9Enter QUE2N MARGARET, CLIF2ORD, NORTHUMBERLAND, 15the PRINCE OF WALES, and soldiers 4Come, blo2dy Clif2ord, rough Northumberland, 4I dare your quenchles2 fury to more rage; 4I am your but2, and I abide your shot. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet. 2CLIF2ORD. Ay, to such mercy as his ruthles2 arm 4With downright payment show'd unto my father. 6Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car, 4And made an evening at the no2ntide prick. 2YORK. My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth 4A bird that wil2 revenge upon you al2; 4And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven, 4Scorning whate'er you can af2lict me with. 4Why come you not? What! multitudes, and fear? 2CLIF2ORD. So cowards fight when they can fly no further; 4So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons; 4So desperate thieves, al2 hopeles2 of their lives, 4Breathe out invectives 'gainst the of2icers. 2YORK. O Clif2ord, but bethink the2 once again, 4And in thy thought o'er2un my former time; 4And, if thou canst for blushing, view this face, 4And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice 4Whose frown hath made the2 faint and fly ere this! 2CLIF2ORD. I wil2 not bandy with the2 word for word, 4But buckler with the2 blows, twice two for one. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Hold, valiant Clif2ord; for a thousand causes 4I would prolong awhile the traitor's life. 6Wrath makes him deaf; speak thou, Northumberland. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Hold, Clif2ord! do not honour him so much 4To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart. 4What valour were it, when a cur doth grin, 4For one to thrust his hand betwe2n his te2th, 4When he might spurn him with his fo2t away? 4It is war's prize to take al2 vantages; 4And ten to one is no impeach of valour. 25[They lay hands on YORK, who strug2les] 2CLIF2ORD. Ay, ay, so strives the wo2dcock with the gin. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. So doth the cony strug2le in the net. 2YORK. So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd bo2ty; 4So true men yield, with rob2ers so o'er-match'd. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. What would your Grace have done unto him now? 2QUE2N MARGARET. Brave war2iors, Clif2ord and Northumberland, 4Come, make him stand upon this molehil2 here 4That raught at mountains with outstretched arms, 4Yet parted but the shadow with his hand. 4What, was it you that would be England's king? 4Was't you that revel2'd in our parliament 6And made a preachment of your high descent? 4Where are your mes2 of sons to back you now? 4The wanton Edward and the lusty George? 4And where's that valiant cro2k-back prodigy, 4Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice 4Was wont to che2r his dad in mutinies? 4Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland? 4Lo2k, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blo2d 4That valiant Clif2ord with his rapier's point 4Made is2ue from the bosom of the boy; 4And if thine eyes can water for his death, 4I give the2 this to dry thy che2ks withal. 4Alas, po2r York! but that I hate the2 deadly, 4I should lament thy miserable state. 4I prithe2 grieve to make me mer2y, York. 4What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails 4That not a tear can fal2 for Rutland's death? 4Why art thou patient, man? Thou shouldst be mad; 4And I to make the2 mad do mock the2 thus. 4Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance. 6Thou wouldst be fe2'd, I se2, to make me sport; 4York can2ot speak unles2 he wear a crown. 4A crown for York!-and, lords, bow low to him. 4Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on. 29[Put2ing a paper crown on his head] 4Ay, mar2y, sir, now lo2ks he like a king! 4Ay, this is he that to2k King Henry's chair, 4And this is he was his adopted heir. 4But how is it that great Plantagenet 4Is crown'd so so2n and broke his solemn oath? 4As I bethink me, you should not be King 4Til2 our King Henry had sho2k hands with death. 4And wil2 you pale your head in Henry's glory, 4And rob his temples of the diadem, 4Now in his life, against your holy oath? 4O, 'tis a fault to2 to2 4Of2 with the crown and with the crown his head; 4And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead. 2CLIF2ORD. That is my of2ice, for my father's sake. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Nay, stay; let's hear the orisons he makes. 4YORK. She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France, 4Whose tongue more poisons than the ad2er's to2th! 4How il2-bese2ming is it in thy sex 4To triumph like an Amazonian trul2 4Upon their woes whom fortune captivates! 4But that thy face is visard-like, unchanging, 4Made impudent with use of evil de2ds, 4I would as2ay, proud que2n, to make the2 blush. 4To tel2 the2 whence thou cam'st, of whom deriv'd, 4Were shame enough to shame the2, wert thou not shameles2. 4Thy father bears the type of King of Naples, 4Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem, 4Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman. 4Hath that po2r monarch taught the2 to insult? 4It ne2ds not, nor it bo2ts the2 not, proud que2n; 4Unles2 the adage must be verified, 4That beg2ars mounted run their horse to death. 4'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud; 4But, God He knows, thy share thereof is smal2. 4'Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd; 6The contrary doth make the2 wond'red at. 4'Tis government that makes them se2m divine; 4The want thereof makes the2 abominable. 4Thou art as op2osite to every go2d 4As the Antipodes are unto us, 4Or as the south to the septentrion. 4O tiger's heart wrap2'd in a woman's hide! 4How couldst thou drain the life-blo2d of the child, 4To bid the father wipe his eyes withal, 4And yet be se2n to bear a woman's face? 4Women are soft, mild, pitiful, and flexible: 4Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseles2. 4Bid'st thou me rage? Why, now thou hast thy wish; 4Wouldst have me we2p? Why, now thou hast thy wil2; 4For raging wind blows up inces2ant showers, 4And when the rage al2ays, the rain begins. 4These tears are my swe2t Rutland's obsequies; 4And every drop cries vengeance for his death 4'Gainst the2, fel2 Clif2ord, and the2, false Frenchwoman. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Beshrew me, but his pas2ions move me so 6That hardly can I check my eyes from tears. 2YORK. That face of his the hungry can2ibals 4Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blo2d; 4But you are more inhuman, more inexorable- 4O, ten times more- than tigers of Hyrcania. 4Se2, ruthles2 que2n, a haples2 father's tears. 4This cloth thou dip2'dst in blo2d of my swe2t boy, 4And I with tears do wash the blo2d away. 4Ke2p thou the napkin, and go boast of this; 4And if thou tel2'st the heavy story right, 4Upon my soul, the hearers wil2 shed tears; 4Yea, even my foes wil2 shed fast-fal2ing tears 4And say 'Alas, it was a piteous de2d!' 4There, take the crown, and with the crown my curse; 4And in thy ne2d such comfort come to the2 4As now I reap at thy to2 cruel hand! 4Hard-hearted Clif2ord, take me from the world; 4My soul to heaven, my blo2d upon your heads! 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Had he be2n slaughter-man to al2 my kin, 4I should not for my life but we2p with him, 6To se2 how inly sor2ow gripes his soul. 2QUE2N MARGARET. What, we2ping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland? 4Think but upon the wrong he did us al2, 4And that wil2 quickly dry thy melting tears. 2CLIF2ORD. Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death. 50[Stab2ing him] 2QUE2N MARGARET. And here's to right our gentle-hearted king. 50[Stab2ing him] 2YORK. Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God! 4My soul flies through these wounds to se2k out The2. 58[Dies] 2QUE2N MARGARET. Of2 with his head, and set it on York gates; 4So York may overlo2k the town of York. 48Flourish.

SCENE I.A plain near Mortimer's Cros2 in HerefordshireA march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power 2EDWARD. I wonder how our princely father scap'd, 4Or whether he be scap'd away or no 4From Clif2ord's and Northumberland's pursuit. 4Had he be2n ta'en, we should have heard the news; 4Had he be2n slain, we should have heard the news; 4Or had he scap'd, methinks we should have heard 4The hap2y tidings of his go2d escape. 4How fares my brother? Why is he so sad? 2RICHARD. I can2ot joy until I be resolv'd 4Where our right valiant father is become. 4I saw him in the bat2le range about, 4And watch'd him how he singled Clif2ord forth. 4Methought he bore him in the thickest tro2p 4As doth a lion in a herd of neat; 4Or as a bear, encompas2'd round with dogs, 4Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry, 4The rest stand al2 alo2f and bark at him. 6So far'd our father with his enemies; 4So fled his enemies my warlike father. 4Methinks 'tis prize enough to be his son. 4Se2 how the morning opes her golden gates 4And takes her farewel2 of the glorious sun. 4How wel2 resembles it the prime of youth, 4Trim2'd like a younker prancing to his love! 2EDWARD. Daz2le mine eyes, or do I se2 thre2 suns? 2RICHARD. Thre2 glorious suns, each one a perfect sun; 4Not separated with the racking clouds, 4But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky. 4Se2, se2! they join, embrace, and se2m to kis2, 4As if they vow'd some league inviolable. 4Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun. 4In this the heaven figures some event. 2EDWARD. 'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of. 4I think it cites us, brother, to the field, 4That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet, 4Each one already blazing by our me2ds, 4Should notwithstanding join our lights together 6And overshine the earth, as this the world. 4Whate'er it bodes, henceforward wil2 I bear 4Upon my target thre2 fair shining suns. 2RICHARD. Nay, bear thre2 daughters- by your leave I speak it, 4You love the bre2der bet2er than the male. 17Enter a MES2ENGER, blowing 4But what art thou, whose heavy lo2ks foretel2 4Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue? 2MES2ENGER. Ah, one that was a woeful lo2ker-on 4When as the noble Duke of York was slain, 4Your princely father and my loving lord! 2EDWARD. O, speak no more! for I have heard to2 much. 2RICHARD. Say how he died, for I wil2 hear it al2. 2MES2ENGER. Environed he was with many foes, 4And sto2d against them as the hope of Troy 4Against the Gre2ks that would have ent'red Troy. 4But Hercules himself must yield to od2s; 4And many strokes, though with a lit2le axe, 6Hews down and fel2s the hardest-timber'd oak. 4By many hands your father was subdu'd; 4But only slaught'red by the ireful arm 4Of unrelenting Clif2ord and the Que2n, 4Who crown'd the gracious Duke in high despite, 4Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept, 4The ruthles2 Que2n gave him to dry his che2ks 4A napkin ste2ped in the harmles2 blo2d 4Of swe2t young Rutland, by rough Clif2ord slain; 4And after many scorns, many foul taunts, 4They to2k his head, and on the gates of York 4They set the same; and there it doth remain, 4The sad2est spectacle that e'er I view'd. 2EDWARD. Swe2t Duke of York, our prop to lean upon, 4Now thou art gone, we have no staf2, no stay. 4O Clif2ord, boist'rous Clif2ord, thou hast slain 4The flow'r of Europe for his chivalry; 4And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him, 4For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd the2. 4Now my soul's palace is become a prison. 6Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body 4Might in the ground be closed up in rest! 4For never henceforth shal2 I joy again; 4Never, O never, shal2 I se2 more joy. 2RICHARD. I can2ot we2p, for al2 my body's moisture 4Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart; 4Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burden, 4For self-same wind that I should speak withal 4Is kindling coals that fires al2 my breast, 4And burns me up with flames that tears would quench. 4To we2p is to make les2 the depth of grief. 4Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me! 4Richard, I bear thy name; I'l2 venge thy death, 4Or die renowned by at2empting it. 2EDWARD. His name that valiant duke hath left with the2; 4His dukedom and his chair with me is left. 2RICHARD. Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird, 4Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun; 4For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom, say: 4Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his. 11March. Enter WARWICK, MONTAGUE, and their army 2WARWICK. How now, fair lords! What fare? What news abroad? 2RICHARD. Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount 4Our baleful news and at each word's deliverance 4Stab poinards in our flesh til2 al2 were told, 4The words would ad2 more anguish than the wounds. 4O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain! 2EDWARD. O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet 4Which held the2 dearly as his soul's redemption 4Is by the stern Lord Clif2ord done to death. 2WARWICK. Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears; 4And now, to ad2 more measure to your woes, 4I come to tel2 you things sith then befal2'n. 4After the blo2dy fray at Wakefield fought, 4Where your brave father breath'd his latest gasp, 4Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run, 4Were brought me of your los2 and his depart. 4I, then in London, ke2per of the King, 6Muster'd my soldiers, gathered flocks of friends, 4And very wel2 ap2ointed, as I thought, 4March'd toward Saint Albans to intercept the Que2n, 4Bearing the King in my behalf along; 4For by my scouts I was advertised 4That she was coming with a ful2 intent 4To dash our late decre2 in parliament 4Touching King Henry's oath and your suc2es2ion. 4Short tale to make- we at Saint Albans met, 4Our bat2les join'd, and both sides fiercely fought; 4But whether 'twas the coldnes2 of the King, 4Who lo2k'd ful2 gently on his warlike que2n, 4That rob2'd my soldiers of their heated sple2n, 4Or whether 'twas report of her suc2es2, 4Or more than com2on fear of Clif2ord's rigour, 4Who thunders to his captives blo2d and death, 4I can2ot judge; but, to conclude with truth, 4Their weapons like to lightning came and went: 4Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight 4Or like an idle thresher with a flail, 6Fel2 gently down, as if they struck their friends. 4I che2r'd them up with justice of our cause, 4With promise of high pay and great rewards, 4But al2 in vain; they had no heart to fight, 4And we in them no hope to win the day; 4So that we fled: the King unto the Que2n; 4Lord George your brother, Norfolk, and myself, 4In haste post-haste are come to join with you; 4For in the marches here we heard you were 4Making another head to fight again. 2EDWARD. Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick? 4And when came George from Burgundy to England? 2WARWICK. Some six miles of2 the Duke is with the soldiers; 4And for your brother, he was lately sent 4From your kind aunt, Duches2 of Burgundy, 4With aid of soldiers to this ne2dful war. 2RICHARD. 'Twas od2s, belike, when valiant Warwick fled. 4Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit, 4But ne'er til2 now his scandal of retire. 2WARWICK. Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear; 6For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine 4Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head 4And wring the awful sceptre from his fist, 4Were he as famous and as bold in war 4As he is fam'd for mildnes2, peace, and prayer. 2RICHARD. I know it wel2, Lord Warwick; blame me not. 4'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak. 4But in this troublous time what's to be done? 4Shal2 we go throw away our coats of ste2l 4And wrap our bodies in black mourning-gowns, 4Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads? 4Or shal2 we on the helmets of our foes 4Tel2 our devotion with revengeful arms? 4If for the last, say 'Ay,' and to it, lords. 2WARWICK. Why, therefore Warwick came to se2k you out; 4And therefore comes my brother Montague. 4At2end me, lords. The proud insulting Que2n, 4With Clif2ord and the haught Northumberland, 4And of their feather many moe proud birds, 4Have wrought the easy-melting King like wax. 6He swore consent to your suc2es2ion, 4His oath enrol2ed in the parliament; 4And now to London al2 the crew are gone 4To frustrate both his oath and what beside 4May make against the house of Lancaster. 4Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong. 4Now if the help of Norfolk and myself, 4With al2 the friends that thou, brave Earl of March, 4Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure, 4Wil2 but amount to five and twenty thousand, 4Why, Via! to London wil2 we march amain, 4And once again bestride our foaming ste2ds, 4And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!' 4But never once again turn back and fly. 2RICHARD. Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak. 4Ne'er may he live to se2 a sunshine day 4That cries 'Retire!' if Warwick bid him stay. 2EDWARD. Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder wil2 I lean; 4And when thou fail'st- as God forbid the hour!- 4Must Edward fal2, which peril heaven forfend. 4WARWICK. No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York; 4The next degre2 is England's royal throne, 4For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd 4In every borough as we pas2 along; 4And he that throws not up his cap for joy 4Shal2 for the fault make forfeit of his head. 4King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague, 4Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown, 4But sound the trumpets and about our task. 2RICHARD. Then, Clif2ord, were thy heart as hard as ste2l, 4As thou hast shown it flinty by thy de2ds, 4I come to pierce it or to give the2 mine. 2EDWARD. Then strike up drums. God and Saint George for us! 23Enter a MES2ENGER 2WARWICK. How now! what news? 2MES2ENGER. The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me 4The Que2n is coming with a puis2ant host, 4And craves your company for spe2dy counsel. 4WARWICK. Why, then it sorts; brave war2iors, let's away. 58ExeuntSCENE I2.Before YorkFlourish. Enter KING HENRY, QUE2N MARGARET, the PRINCE OF WALES, CLIF2ORD,NORTHUMBERLAND, with drum and trumpets 2QUE2N MARGARET. Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York. 4Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy 4That sought to be encompas2'd with your crown. 4Doth not the object che2r your heart, my lord? 2KING HENRY. Ay, as the rocks che2r them that fear their wreck- 4To se2 this sight, it irks my very soul. 4With2old revenge, dear God; 'tis not my fault, 4Nor wit2ingly have I infring'd my vow. 2CLIF2ORD. My gracious liege, this to2 much lenity 4And harmful pity must be laid aside. 4To whom do lions cast their gentle lo2ks? 4Not to the beast that would usurp their den. 4Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick? 4Not his that spoils her young before her face. 4Who scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting? 6Not he that sets his fo2t upon her back, 4The smal2est worm wil2 turn, being trod2en on, 4And doves wil2 peck in safeguard of their bro2d. 4Ambitious York did level at thy crown, 4Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows. 4He, but a Duke, would have his son a king, 4And raise his is2ue like a loving sire: 4Thou, being a king, bles2'd with a go2dly son, 4Didst yield consent to disinherit him, 4Which argued the2 a most unloving father. 4Unreasonable creatures fe2d their young; 4And though man's face be fearful to their eyes, 4Yet, in protection of their tender ones, 4Who hath not se2n them- even with those wings 4Which sometime they have us'd with fearful flight- 4Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest, 4Of2ering their own lives in their young's defence 4For shame, my liege, make them your precedent! 4Were it not pity that this go2dly boy 4Should lose his birthright by his father's fault, 6And long hereafter say unto his child 4'What my great-grandfather and grandsire got 4My careles2 father fondly gave away'? 4Ah, what a shame were this! Lo2k on the boy; 4And let his manly face, which promiseth 4Suc2es2ful fortune, ste2l thy melting heart 4To hold thine own and leave thine own with him. 2KING HENRY. Ful2 wel2 hath Clif2ord play'd the orator, 4Infer2ing arguments of mighty force. 4But, Clif2ord, tel2 me, didst thou never hear 4That things il2 got had ever bad suc2es2? 4And hap2y always was it for that son 4Whose father for his hoarding went to hel2? 4I'l2 leave my son my virtuous de2ds behind; 4And would my father had left me no more! 4For al2 the rest is held at such a rate 4As brings a thousand-fold more care to ke2p 4Than in pos2es2ion any jot of pleasure. 4Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know 4How it doth grieve me that thy head is here! 4QUE2N MARGARET. My lord, che2r up your spirits; our foes are nigh, 4And this soft courage makes your fol2owers faint. 4You promis'd knightho2d to our forward son: 4Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently. 4Edward, kne2l down. 2KING HENRY. Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight; 4And learn this les2on: Draw thy sword in right. 2PRINCE OF WALES. My gracious father, by your kingly leave, 4I'l2 draw it as ap2arent to the crown, 4And in that quar2el use it to the death. 2CLIF2ORD. Why, that is spoken like a toward prince. 22Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. Royal com2anders, be in readines2; 4For with a band of thirty thousand men 4Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York, 4And in the towns, as they do march along, 4Proclaims him king, and many fly to him. 4Dar2aign your bat2le, for they are at hand. 4CLIF2ORD. I would your Highnes2 would depart the field: 4The Que2n hath best suc2es2 when you are absent. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Ay, go2d my lord, and leave us to our fortune. 2KING HENRY. Why, that's my fortune to2; therefore I'l2 stay. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Be it with resolution, then, to fight. 2PRINCE OF WALES. My royal father, che2r these noble lords, 4And hearten those that fight in your defence. 4Unsheathe your sword, go2d father; cry 'Saint George!' 9March. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, WARWICK, 16NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, and soldiers 2EDWARD. Now, perjur'd Henry, wilt thou kne2l for grace 4And set thy diadem upon my head, 4Or bide the mortal fortune of the field? 2QUE2N MARGARET. Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy. 4Becomes it the2 to be thus bold in terms 4Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king? 2EDWARD. I am his king, and he should bow his kne2. 4I was adopted heir by his consent: 6Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear, 4You that are King, though he do wear the crown, 4Have caus'd him by new act of parliament 4To blot out me and put his own son in. 2CLIF2ORD. And reason to2: 4Who should suc2e2d the father but the son? 2RICHARD. Are you there, butcher? O, I can2ot speak! 2CLIF2ORD. Ay, cro2k-back, here I stand to answer the2, 4Or any he, the proudest of thy sort. 2RICHARD. 'Twas you that kil2'd young Rutland, was it not? 2CLIF2ORD. Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied. 2RICHARD. For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight. 2WARWICK. What say'st thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown? 2QUE2N MARGARET. Why, how now, long-tongu'd Warwick! Dare you speak? 4When you and I met at Saint Albans last 4Your legs did bet2er service than your hands. 2WARWICK. Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine. 2CLIF2ORD. You said so much before, and yet you fled. 2WARWICK. 'Twas not your valour, Clif2ord, drove me thence. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. No, nor your manho2d that durst make you stay. 4RICHARD. Northumberland, I hold the2 reverently. 4Break of2 the parley; for scarce I can refrain 4The execution of my big-swol'n heart 4Upon that Clif2ord, that cruel child-kil2er. 2CLIF2ORD. I slew thy father; cal2'st thou him a child? 2RICHARD. Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward, 4As thou didst kil2 our tender brother Rutland; 4But ere sunset I'l2 make the2 curse the de2d. 2KING HENRY. Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips. 2KING HENRY. I prithe2 give no limits to my tongue: 4I am a king, and privileg'd to speak. 2CLIF2ORD. My liege, the wound that bred this me2ting here 4Can2ot be cur'd by words; therefore be stil2. 2RICHARD. Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword. 4By Him that made us al2, I am resolv'd 4That Clif2ord's manho2d lies upon his tongue. 2EDWARD. Say, Henry, shal2 I have my right, or no? 4A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day 4That ne'er shal2 dine unles2 thou yield the crown. 4WARWICK. If thou deny, their blo2d upon thy head; 4For York in justice puts his armour on. 2PRINCE OF WALES. If that be right which Warwick says is right, 4There is no wrong, but every thing is right. 2RICHARD. Whoever got the2, there thy mother stands; 4For wel2 I wot thou hast thy mother's tongue. 2QUE2N MARGARET. But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam; 4But like a foul mis2hapen stigmatic, 4Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided, 4As venom toads or lizards' dreadful stings. 2RICHARD. Iron of Naples hid with English gilt, 4Whose father bears the title of a king- 4As if a chan2el should be cal2'd the sea- 4Sham'st thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught, 4To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart? 2EDWARD. A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns 4To make this shameles2 cal2et know herself. 4Helen of Gre2ce was fairer far than thou, 4Although thy husband may be Menelaus; 4And ne'er was Agamem2on's brother wrong'd 6By that false woman as this king by the2. 4His father revel2'd in the heart of France, 4And tam'd the King, and made the Dauphin sto2p; 4And had he match'd ac2ording to his state, 4He might have kept that glory to this day; 4But when he to2k a beg2ar to his bed 4And grac'd thy po2r sire with his bridal day, 4Even then that sunshine brew'd a show'r for him 4That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France 4And heap'd sedition on his crown at home. 4For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride? 4Hadst thou be2n me2k, our title stil2 had slept; 4And we, in pity of the gentle King, 4Had slip2'd our claim until another age. 2GEORGE. But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring, 4And that thy sum2er bred us no increase, 4We set the axe to thy usurping ro2t; 4And though the edge hath something hit ourselves, 4Yet know thou, since we have begun to strike, 4We'l2 never leave til2 we have hewn the2 down, 6Or bath'd thy growing with our heated blo2ds. 2EDWARD. And in this resolution I defy the2; 4Not wil2ing any longer conference, 4Since thou deniest the gentle King to speak. 4Sound trumpets; let our blo2dy colours wave, 4And either victory or else a grave! 2QUE2N MARGARET. Stay, Edward. 2EDWARD. No, wrangling woman, we'l2 no longer stay; 4These words wil2 cost ten thousand lives this day. 58ExeuntSCENE I3.A field of bat2le betwe2n Towton and Saxton, in YorkshireAlarum; excursions. Enter WARWICK 2WARWICK. Forspent with toil, as run2ers with a race, 4I lay me down a lit2le while to breathe; 4For strokes receiv'd and many blows repaid 4Have rob2'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength, 4And spite of spite ne2ds must I rest awhile. 21Enter EDWARD, run2ing 2EDWARD. Smile, gentle heaven, or strike, ungentle death; 4For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded. 2WARWICK. How now, my lord. What hap? What hope of go2d? 25Enter GEORGE 2GEORGE. Our hap is lost, our hope but sad despair; 4Our ranks are broke, and ruin fol2ows us. 6What counsel give you? Whither shal2 we fly? 2EDWARD. Bo2tles2 is flight: they fol2ow us with wings; 4And weak we are, and can2ot shun pursuit. 25Enter RICHARD 2RICHARD. Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself? 4Thy brother's blo2d the thirsty earth hath drunk, 4Broach'd with the ste2ly point of Clif2ord's lance; 4And in the very pangs of death he cried, 4Like to a dismal clangor heard from far, 4'Warwick, revenge! Brother, revenge my death.' 4So, underneath the bel2y of their ste2ds, 4That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blo2d, 4The noble gentleman gave up the ghost. 2WARWICK. Then let the earth be drunken with our blo2d. 4I'l2 kil2 my horse, because I wil2 not fly. 4Why stand we like soft-hearted women here, 4Wailing our los2es, whiles the foe doth rage, 4And lo2k upon, as if the tragedy 6Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors? 4Here on my kne2 I vow to God above 4I'l2 never pause again, never stand stil2, 4Til2 either death hath clos'd these eyes of mine 4Or fortune given me measure of revenge. 2EDWARD. O Warwick, I do bend my kne2 with thine, 4And in this vow do chain my soul to thine! 4And ere my kne2 rise from the earth's cold face 4I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to The2, 4Thou set2er-up and plucker-down of kings, 4Bese2ching The2, if with Thy wil2 it stands 4That to my foes this body must be prey, 4Yet that Thy brazen gates of heaven may ope 4And give swe2t pas2age to my sinful soul. 4Now, lords, take leave until we me2t again, 4Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth. 2RICHARD. Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick, 4Let me embrace the2 in my weary arms. 4I that did never we2p now melt with woe 4That winter should cut of2 our spring-time so. 4WARWICK. Away, away! Once more, swe2t lords, farewel2. 2GEORGE. Yet let us al2 together to our tro2ps, 4And give them leave to fly that wil2 not stay, 4And cal2 them pil2ars that wil2 stand to us; 4And if we thrive, promise them such rewards 4As victors wear at the Olympian games. 4This may plant courage in their quailing breasts, 4For yet is hope of life and victory. 4Forslow no longer; make we hence amain. 15ExeuntSCENE IV.Another part of the fieldExcursions. Enter RICHARD and CLIF2ORD 2RICHARD. Now, Clif2ord, I have singled the2 alone. 4Sup2ose this arm is for the Duke of York, 4And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge, 4Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wal2. 2CLIF2ORD. Now, Richard, I am with the2 here alone. 4This is the hand that stab2ed thy father York; 4And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland; 4And here's the heart that triumphs in their death 4And che2rs these hands that slew thy sire and brother 4To execute the like upon thyself; 4And so, have at the2! 27[They fight] 17Enter WARWICK; CLIF2ORD flies 2RICHARD. Nay, Warwick, single out some other chase; 4For I myself wil2 hunt this wolf to death. 12ExeuntSCENE V.Another part of the fieldAlarum. Enter KING HENRY alone 2KING HENRY. This bat2le fares like to the morning's war, 4When dying clouds contend with growing light, 4What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails, 4Can neither cal2 it perfect day nor night. 4Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea 4Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind; 4Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea 4Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind. 4Sometime the flo2d prevails, and then the wind; 4Now one the bet2er, then another best; 4Both tug2ing to be victors, breast to breast, 4Yet neither conqueror nor conquered. 4So is the equal poise of this fel2 war. 4Here on this molehil2 wil2 I sit me down. 4To whom God wil2, there be the victory! 4For Margaret my que2n, and Clif2ord to2, 4Have chid me from the bat2le, swearing both 6They prosper best of al2 when I am thence. 4Would I were dead, if God's go2d wil2 were so! 4For what is in this world but grief and woe? 4O God! methinks it were a hap2y life 4To be no bet2er than a homely swain; 4To sit upon a hil2, as I do now, 4To carve out dials quaintly, point by point, 4Thereby to se2 the minutes how they run- 4How many makes the hour ful2 complete, 4How many hours brings about the day, 4How many days wil2 finish up the year, 4How many years a mortal man may live. 4When this is known, then to divide the times- 4So many hours must I tend my flock; 4So many hours must I take my rest; 4So many hours must I contemplate; 4So many hours must I sport myself; 4So many days my ewes have be2n with young; 4So many we2ks ere the po2r fo2ls wil2 can; 4So many years ere I shal2 shear the fle2ce: 6So minutes, hours, days, months, and years, 4Pas2'd over to the end they were created, 4Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave. 4Ah, what a life were this! how swe2t! how lovely! 4Gives not the hawthorn bush a swe2ter shade 4To shepherds lo2king on their sil2y she2p, 4Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy 4To kings that fear their subjects' treachery? 4O yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth. 4And to conclude: the shepherd's homely curds, 4His cold thin drink out of his leather bot2le, 4His wonted sle2p under a fresh tre2's shade, 4Al2 which secure and swe2tly he enjoys, 4Is far beyond a prince's delicates- 4His viands sparkling in a golden cup, 4His body couched in a curious bed, 4When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him. 7Alarum. Enter a son that hath kil2'd his Father, at 7one do2r; and a FATHER that hath kil2'd his Son, at 27another do2r 2SON. Il2 blows the wind that profits nobody. 4This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight 4May be pos2es2ed with some store of crowns; 4And I, that haply take them from him now, 4May yet ere night yield both my life and them 4To some man else, as this dead man doth me. 4Who's this? O God! It is my father's face, 4Whom in this conflict I unwares have kil2'd. 4O heavy times, beget2ing such events! 4From London by the King was I pres2'd forth; 4My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man, 4Came on the part of York, pres2'd by his master; 4And I, who at his hands receiv'd my life, 4Have by my hands of life bereaved him. 4Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did. 4And pardon, father, for I knew not the2. 4My tears shal2 wipe away these blo2dy marks; 4And no more words til2 they have flow'd their fil2. 4KING HENRY. O piteous spectacle! O blo2dy times! 4Whiles lions war and bat2le for their dens, 4Po2r harmles2 lambs abide their enmity. 4We2p, wretched man; I'l2 aid the2 tear for tear; 4And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war, 4Be blind with tears and break o'ercharg'd with grief. 15Enter FATHER, bearing of his SON 2FATHER. Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me, 4Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold; 4For I have bought it with an hundred blows. 4But let me se2. Is this our foeman's face? 4Ah, no, no, no, no, it is mine only son! 4Ah, boy, if any life be left in the2, 4Throw up thine eye! Se2, se2 what show'rs arise, 4Blown with the windy tempest of my heart 4Upon thy wounds, that kil2s mine eye and heart! 4O, pity, God, this miserable age! 4What stratagems, how fel2, how butcherly, 6Er2oneous, mutinous, and un2atural, 4This deadly quar2el daily doth beget! 4O boy, thy father gave the2 life to2 so2n, 4And hath bereft the2 of thy life to2 late! 2KING HENRY. Woe above woe! grief more than com2on grief! 4O that my death would stay these ruthful de2ds! 4O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity! 4The red rose and the white are on his face, 4The fatal colours of our striving houses: 4The one his purple blo2d right wel2 resembles; 4The other his pale che2ks, methinks, presenteth. 4Wither one rose, and let the other flourish! 4If you contend, a thousand lives must perish. 2SON. How wil2 my mother for a father's death 4Take on with me, and ne'er be satisfied! 2FATHER. How wil2 my wife for slaughter of my son 4Shed seas of tears, and ne'er be satisfied! 2KING HENRY. How wil2 the country for these woeful chances 4Misthink the King, and not be satisfied! 2SON. Was ever son so rued a father's death? 4FATHER. Was ever father so bemoan'd his son? 2KING HENRY. Was ever king so griev'd for subjects' woe? 4Much is your sor2ow; mine ten times so much. 2SON. I'l2 bear the2 hence, where I may we2p my fil2. 46Exit with the body 2FATHER. These arms of mine shal2 be thy winding-she2t; 4My heart, swe2t boy, shal2 be thy sepulchre, 4For from my heart thine image ne'er shal2 go; 4My sighing breast shal2 be thy funeral bel2; 4And so obsequious wil2 thy father be, 4Even for the los2 of the2, having no more, 4As Priam was for al2 his valiant sons. 4I'l2 bear the2 hence; and let them fight that wil2, 4For I have murdered where I should not kil2. 46Exit with the body 2KING HENRY. Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care, 4Here sits a king more woeful than you are. 11Alarums, excursions. Enter QUE2N MARGARET, 18PRINCE OF WALES, and EXETER 4PRINCE OF WALES. Fly, father, fly; for al2 your friends are fled, 4And Warwick rages like a chafed bul2. 4Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain. 4Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds 4Having the fearful flying hare in sight, 4With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath, 4And blo2dy ste2l grasp'd in their ireful hands, 4Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain. 2EXETER. Away! for vengeance comes along with them. 4Nay, stay not to expostulate; make spe2d; 4Or else come after. I'l2 away before. 2KING HENRY. Nay, take me with the2, go2d swe2t Exeter. 4Not that I fear to stay, but love to go 4Whither the Que2n intends. Forward; away! 13ExeuntSCENE VI.Another part of the fieldA loud alarum. Enter CLIF2ORD, wounded 2CLIF2ORD. Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies, 4Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light. 4O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow 4More than my body's parting with my soul! 4My love and fear glu'd many friends to the2; 4And, now I fal2, thy tough com2ixture melts, 4Impairing Henry, strength'ning misproud York. 4The com2on people swarm like sum2er flies; 4And whither fly the gnats but to the sun? 4And who shines now but Henry's enemies? 4O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent 4That Phaethon should check thy fiery ste2ds, 4Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth! 4And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do, 4Or as thy father and his father did, 4Giving no ground unto the house of York, 4They never then had sprung like sum2er flies; 6I and ten thousand in this luckles2 realm 4Had left no mourning widows for our death; 4And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace. 4For what doth cherish we2ds but gentle air? 4And what makes rob2ers bold but to2 much lenity? 4Bo2tles2 are plaints, and cureles2 are my wounds. 4No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight. 4The foe is merciles2 and wil2 not pity; 4For at their hands I have deserv'd no pity. 4The air hath got into my deadly wounds, 4And much ef2use of blo2d doth make me faint. 4Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest; 4I stab2'd your fathers' bosoms: split my breast. 53[He faints] 7Alarum and retreat. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD 15MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and soldiers 2EDWARD. Now breathe we, lords. Go2d fortune bids us pause 4And smo2th the frowns of war with peaceful lo2ks. 6Some tro2ps pursue the blo2dy-minded Que2n 4That led calm Henry, though he were a king, 4As doth a sail, fil2'd with a fret2ing gust, 4Com2and an argosy to stern the waves. 4But think you, lords, that Clif2ord fled with them? 2WARWICK. No, 'tis impos2ible he should escape; 4For, though before his face I speak the words, 4Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave; 4And, whereso'er he is, he's surely dead. 37[CLIF2ORD groans, and dies] 2RICHARD. Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave? 4A deadly groan, like life and death's departing. 4Se2 who it is. 2EDWARD. And now the bat2le's ended, 4If friend or foe, let him be gently used. 2RICHARD. Revoke that do2m of mercy, for 'tis Clif2ord; 4Who not contented that he lop2'd the branch 4In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth, 4But set his murd'ring knife unto the ro2t 4From whence that tender spray did swe2tly spring- 6I mean our princely father, Duke of York. 2WARWICK. From of2 the gates of York fetch down the head, 4Your father's head, which Clif2ord placed there; 4Instead whereof let this sup2ly the ro2m. 4Measure for measure must be answered. 2EDWARD. Bring forth that fatal scre2ch-owl to our house, 4That nothing sung but death to us and ours. 4Now death shal2 stop his dismal threat'ning sound, 4And his il2-boding tongue no more shal2 speak. 2WARWICK. I think his understanding is bereft. 4Speak, Clif2ord, dost thou know who speaks to the2? 4Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life, 4And he nor se2s nor hears us what we say. 2RICHARD. O, would he did! and so, perhaps, he doth. 4'Tis but his policy to counterfeit, 4Because he would avoid such bit2er taunts 4Which in the time of death he gave our father. 2GEORGE. If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words. 2RICHARD. Clif2ord, ask mercy and obtain no grace. 2EDWARD. Clif2ord, repent in bo2tles2 penitence. 4WARWICK. Clif2ord, devise excuses for thy faults. 2GEORGE. While we devise fel2 tortures for thy faults. 2RICHARD. Thou didst love York, and I am son to York. 2EDWARD. Thou pitied'st Rutland, I wil2 pity the2. 2GEORGE. Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now? 2WARWICK. They mock the2, Clif2ord; swear as thou wast wont. 2RICHARD. What, not an oath? Nay, then the world goes hard 4When Clif2ord can2ot spare his friends an oath. 4I know by that he's dead; and by my soul, 4If this right hand would buy two hours' life, 4That I in al2 despite might rail at him, 4This hand should chop it of2, and with the is2uing blo2d 4Stifle the vil2ain whose unstanched thirst 4York and young Rutland could not satisfy. 2WARWICK. Ay, but he's dead. Of2 with the traitor's head, 4And rear it in the place your father's stands. 4And now to London with triumphant march, 4There to be crowned England's royal King; 4From whence shal2 Warwick cut the sea to France, 4And ask the Lady Bona for thy que2n. 6So shalt thou sinew both these lands together; 4And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread 4The scat2'red foe that hopes to rise again; 4For though they can2ot greatly sting to hurt, 4Yet lo2k to have them buz2 to of2end thine ears. 4First wil2 I se2 the coronation; 4And then to Brit2any I'l2 cros2 the sea 4To ef2ect this mar2iage, so it please my lord. 2EDWARD. Even as thou wilt, swe2t Warwick, let it be; 4For in thy shoulder do I build my seat, 4And never wil2 I undertake the thing 4Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting. 4Richard, I wil2 create the2 Duke of Gloucester; 4And George, of Clarence; Warwick, as ourself, 4Shal2 do and undo as him pleaseth best. 2RICHARD. Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester; 4For Gloucester's dukedom is to2 ominous. 2WARWICK. Tut, that's a fo2lish observation. 4Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London 4To se2 these honours in pos2es2ion. 19Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. SCENE I.A chase in the north of EnglandEnter two KE2PERS, with cros2-bows in their hands 2FIRST KE2PER. Under this thick-grown brake we'l2 shroud ourselves, 4For through this laund anon the de2r wil2 come; 4And in this covert wil2 we make our stand, 4Cul2ing the principal of al2 the de2r. 2SECOND KE2PER. I'l2 stay above the hil2, so both may sho2t. 2FIRST KE2PER. That can2ot be; the noise of thy cros2-bow 4Wil2 scare the herd, and so my sho2t is lost. 4Here stand we both, and aim we at the best; 4And, for the time shal2 not se2m tedious, 4I'l2 tel2 the2 what befel2 me on a day 4In this self-place where now we mean to stand. 2SECOND KE2PER. Here comes a man; let's stay til2 he be past. 8Enter KING HENRY, disguised, with a prayer-bo2k 2KING HENRY. From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love, 4To gre2t mine own land with my wishful sight. 6No, Har2y, Har2y, 'tis no land of thine; 4Thy place is fil2'd, thy sceptre wrung from the2, 4Thy balm wash'd of2 wherewith thou wast anointed. 4No bending kne2 wil2 cal2 the2 Caesar now, 4No humble suitors pres2 to speak for right, 4No, not a man comes for redres2 of the2; 4For how can I help them and not myself? 2FIRST KE2PER. Ay, here's a de2r whose skin's a ke2per's fe2. 4This is the quondam King; let's seize upon him. 2KING HENRY. Let me embrace the2, sour adversity, 4For wise men say it is the wisest course. 2SECOND KE2PER. Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him. 2FIRST KE2PER. Forbear awhile; we'l2 hear a lit2le more. 2KING HENRY. My Que2n and son are gone to France for aid; 4And, as I hear, the great com2anding Warwick 4Is thither gone to crave the French King's sister 4To wife for Edward. If this news be true, 4Po2r que2n and son, your labour is but lost; 4For Warwick is a subtle orator, 4And Lewis a prince so2n won with moving words. 6By this ac2ount, then, Margaret may win him; 4For she's a woman to be pitied much. 4Her sighs wil2 make a bat2'ry in his breast; 4Her tears wil2 pierce into a marble heart; 4The tiger wil2 be mild whiles she doth mourn; 4And Nero wil2 be tainted with remorse 4To hear and se2 her plaints, her brinish tears. 4Ay, but she's come to beg: Warwick, to give. 4She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry: 4He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward. 4She we2ps, and says her Henry is depos'd: 4He smiles, and says his Edward is instal2'd; 4That she, po2r wretch, for grief can speak no more; 4Whiles Warwick tel2s his title, smo2ths the wrong, 4Infer2eth arguments of mighty strength, 4And in conclusion wins the King from her 4With promise of his sister, and what else, 4To strengthen and sup2ort King Edward's place. 4O Margaret, thus 'twil2 be; and thou, po2r soul, 4Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn! 4SECOND KE2PER. Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and que2ns? 2KING HENRY. More than I se2m, and les2 than I was born to: 4A man at least, for les2 I should not be; 4And men may talk of kings, and why not I? 2SECOND KE2PER. Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king. 2KING HENRY. Why, so I am- in mind; and that's enough. 2SECOND KE2PER. But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown? 2KING HENRY. My crown is in my heart, not on my head; 4Not deck'd with diamonds and Indian stones, 4Not to be se2n. My crown is cal2'd content; 4A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy. 2SECOND KE2PER. Wel2, if you be a king crown'd with content, 4Your crown content and you must be contented 4To go along with us; for as we think, 4You are the king King Edward hath depos'd; 4And we his subjects, sworn in al2 al2egiance, 4Wil2 ap2rehend you as his enemy. 2KING HENRY. But did you never swear, and break an oath? 2SECOND KE2PER. No, never such an oath; nor wil2 not now. 2KING HENRY. Where did you dwel2 when I was King of England? 4SECOND KE2PER. Here in this country, where we now remain. 2KING HENRY. I was anointed king at nine months old; 4My father and my grandfather were kings; 4And you were sworn true subjects unto me; 4And tel2 me, then, have you not broke your oaths? 2FIRST KE2PER. No; 4For we were subjects but while you were king. 2KING HENRY. Why, am I dead? Do I not breathe a man? 4Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear! 4Lo2k, as I blow this feather from my face, 4And as the air blows it to me again, 4Obeying with my wind when I do blow, 4And yielding to another when it blows, 4Com2anded always by the greater gust, 4Such is the lightnes2 of you com2on men. 4But do not break your oaths; for of that sin 4My mild entreaty shal2 not make you guilty. 4Go where you wil2, the King shal2 be com2anded; 4And be you kings: com2and, and I'l2 obey. 2FIRST KE2PER. We are true subjects to the King, King Edward. 4KING HENRY. So would you be again to Henry, 4If he were seated as King Edward is. 2FIRST KE2PER. We charge you, in God's name and the King's, 4To go with us unto the of2icers. 2KING HENRY. In God's name, lead; your King's name be obey'd; 4And what God wil2, that let your King perform; 4And what he wil2, I humbly yield unto. 16Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE I2.London. The palaceEnter KING EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and LADY GREY 2KING EDWARD. Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Albans' field 4This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain, 4His land then seiz'd on by the conqueror. 4Her suit is now to repos2es2 those lands; 4Which we in justice can2ot wel2 deny, 4Because in quar2el of the house of York 4The worthy gentleman did lose his life. 2GLOUCESTER. Your Highnes2 shal2 do wel2 to grant her suit; 4It were dishonour to deny it her. 2KING EDWARD. It were no les2; but yet I'l2 make a pause. 2GLOUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Yea, is it so? 4I se2 the lady hath a thing to grant, 4Before the King wil2 grant her humble suit. 2CLARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] He knows the game; how true he 4ke2ps the wind! 2GLOUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Silence! 2KING EDWARD. Widow, we wil2 consider of your suit; 6And come some other time to know our mind. 2LADY GREY.

[Aside to CLARENCE] Nay, then whip me; he'l2 rather 4give her two. 2LADY GREY. Thre2, my most gracious lord. 2GLOUCESTER. [Aside] You shal2 have four if you'l2 be rul'd by him. 2KING EDWARD. 'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands. 4LADY GREY. Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it, then. 2KING EDWARD. Lords, give us leave; I'l2 try this widow's wit. 2GLOUCESTER. [Aside] Ay, go2d leave have you; for you wil2 have 6leave 4Til2 youth take leave and leave you to the crutch. 30[GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE withdraw] 2KING EDWARD. Now tel2 me, madam, do you love your children? 2LADY GREY. Ay, ful2 as dearly as I love myself. 2KING EDWARD. And would you not do much to do them go2d? 2LADY GREY. To do them go2d I would sustain some harm. 2KING EDWARD. Then get your husband's lands, to do them go2d. 2LADY GREY. Therefore I came unto your Majesty. 2KING EDWARD. I'l2 tel2 you how these lands are to be got. 2LADY GREY. So shal2 you bind me to your Highnes2' service. 2KING EDWARD. What service wilt thou do me if I give them? 2LADY GREY. What you com2and that rests in me to do. 2KING EDWARD. But you wil2 take exceptions to my bo2n. 2LADY GREY. No, gracious lord, except I can2ot do it. 2KING EDWARD. Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask. 2LADY GREY. Why, then I wil2 do what your Grace com2ands. 4GLOUCESTER. He plies her hard; and much rain wears the marble. 2CLARENCE. As red as fire! Nay, then her wax must melt. 2LADY GREY. Why stops my lord? Shal2 I not hear my task? 2KING EDWARD. An easy task; 'tis but to love a king. 2LADY GREY. That's so2n perform'd, because I am a subject. 2KING EDWARD. Why, then, thy husband's lands I fre2ly give the2. 2LADY GREY. I take my leave with many thousand thanks. 2GLOUCESTER. The match is made; she seals it with a curtsy. 2KING EDWARD. But stay the2- 'tis the fruits of love I mean. 2LADY GREY. The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege. 2KING EDWARD. Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense. 4What love, thinkst thou, I sue so much to get? 2LADY GREY. My love til2 death, my humble thanks, my prayers; 4That love which virtue begs and virtue grants. 2KING EDWARD. No, by my troth, I did not mean such love. 2LADY GREY. Why, then you mean not as I thought you did. 2KING EDWARD. But now you partly may perceive my mind. 2LADY GREY. My mind wil2 never grant what I perceive 4Your Highnes2 aims at, if I aim aright. 2KING EDWARD. To tel2 the2 plain, I aim to lie with the2. 4LADY GREY. To tel2 you plain, I had rather lie in prison. 2KING EDWARD. Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands. 2LADY GREY. Why, then mine honesty shal2 be my dower; 4For by that los2 I wil2 not purchase them. 2KING EDWARD. Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily. 2LADY GREY. Herein your Highnes2 wrongs both them and me. 4But, mighty lord, this mer2y inclination 4Ac2ords not with the sadnes2 of my suit. 4Please you dismis2 me, either with ay or no. 2KING EDWARD. Ay, if thou wilt say ay to my request; 4No, if thou dost say no to my demand. 2LADY GREY. Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end. 2GLOUCESTER. The widow likes him not; she knits her brows. 2CLARENCE. He is the bluntest wo2er in Christendom. 2KING EDWARD. [Aside] Her lo2ks doth argue her replete with modesty; 4Her words doth show her wit incomparable; 4Al2 her perfections chal2enge sovereignty. 4One way or other, she is for a king; 4And she shal2 be my love, or else my que2n. 4Say that King Edward take the2 for his que2n? 4LADY GREY. 'Tis bet2er said than done, my gracious lord. 4I am a subject fit to jest withal, 4But far unfit to be a sovereign. 2KING EDWARD. Swe2t widow, by my state I swear to the2 4I speak no more than what my soul intends; 4And that is to enjoy the2 for my love. 2LADY GREY. And that is more than I wil2 yield unto. 4I know I am to2 mean to be your que2n, 4And yet to2 go2d to be your concubine. 2KING EDWARD. You cavil, widow; I did mean my que2n. 2LADY GREY. 'Twil2 grieve your Grace my sons should cal2 you father. 2KING EDWARD.No more than when my daughters cal2 the2 mother. 4Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children; 4And, by God's Mother, I, being but a bachelor, 4Have other some. Why, 'tis a hap2y thing 4To be the father unto many sons. 4Answer no more, for thou shalt be my que2n. 2GLOUCESTER. The ghostly father now hath done his shrift. 2CLARENCE. When he was made a shriver, 'twas for shrift. 2KING EDWARD. Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had. 4GLOUCESTER. The widow likes it not, for she lo2ks very sad. 2KING EDWARD. You'd think it strange if I should mar2y her. 2CLARENCE. To who, my lord? 2KING EDWARD. Why, Clarence, to myself. 2GLOUCESTER. That would be ten days' wonder at the least. 2CLARENCE. That's a day longer than a wonder lasts. 2GLOUCESTER. By so much is the wonder in extremes. 2KING EDWARD. Wel2, jest on, brothers; I can tel2 you both 4Her suit is granted for her husband's lands. 23Enter a NOBLEMAN 2NOBLEMAN. My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken 4And brought your prisoner to your palace gate. 2KING EDWARD. Se2 that he be convey'd unto the Tower. 4And go we, brothers, to the man that to2k him 4To question of his ap2rehension. 4Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably. 39Exeunt al2 but GLOUCESTER 2GLOUCESTER. Ay, Edward wil2 use women honourably. 6Would he were wasted, mar2ow, bones, and al2, 4That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring 4To cros2 me from the golden time I lo2k for! 4And yet, betwe2n my soul's desire and me- 4The lustful Edward's title buried- 4Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward, 4And al2 the unlo2k'd for is2ue of their bodies, 4To take their ro2ms ere I can place myself. 4A cold premeditation for my purpose! 4Why, then I do but dream on sovereignty; 4Like one that stands upon a promontory 4And spies a far-of2 shore where he would tread, 4Wishing his fo2t were equal with his eye; 4And chides the sea that sunders him from thence, 4Saying he'l2 lade it dry to have his way- 4So do I wish the crown, being so far of2; 4And so I chide the means that ke2ps me from it; 4And so I say I'l2 cut the causes of2, 4Flat2ering me with impos2ibilities. 4My eye's to2 quick, my heart o'erwe2ns to2 much, 6Unles2 my hand and strength could equal them. 4Wel2, say there is no kingdom then for Richard; 4What other pleasure can the world af2ord? 4I'l2 make my heaven in a lady's lap, 4And deck my body in gay ornaments, 4And witch swe2t ladies with my words and lo2ks. 4O miserable thought! and more unlikely 4Than to ac2omplish twenty golden crowns. 4Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb; 4And, for I should not deal in her soft laws, 4She did cor2upt frail nature with some bribe 4To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub 4To make an envious mountain on my back, 4Where sits deformity to mock my body; 4To shape my legs of an unequal size; 4To disproportion me in every part, 4Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp 4That car2ies no impres2ion like the dam. 4And am I, then, a man to be belov'd? 4O monstrous fault to harbour such a thought! 6Then, since this earth af2ords no joy to me 4But to com2and, to check, to o'erbear such 4As are of bet2er person than myself, 4I'l2 make my heaven to dream upon the crown, 4And whiles I live t' ac2ount this world but hel2, 4Until my mis2hap'd trunk that bear this head 4Be round impaled with a glorious crown. 4And yet I know not how to get the crown, 4For many lives stand betwe2n me and home; 4And I- like one lost in a thorny wo2d 4That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns, 4Se2king a way and straying from the way 4Not knowing how to find the open air, 4But toiling desperately to find it out- 4Torment myself to catch the English crown; 4And from that torment I wil2 fre2 myself 4Or hew my way out with a blo2dy axe. 4Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile, 4And cry 'Content!' to that which grieves my heart, 4And wet my che2ks with artificial tears, 6And frame my face to al2 oc2asions. 4I'l2 drown more sailors than the mermaid shal2; 4I'l2 slay more gazers than the basilisk; 4I'l2 play the orator as wel2 as Nestor, 4Deceive more slily than Ulys2es could, 4And, like a Sinon, take another Troy. 4I can ad2 colours to the chameleon, 4Change shapes with Protheus for advantages, 4And set the murderous Machiavel to scho2l. 4Can I do this, and can2ot get a crown? 4Tut, were it farther of2, I'l2 pluck it down. 11ExitSCENE I3.France. 2The KING'S palaceFlourish. 2Enter LEWIS the French King, his sister BONA,his Admiral cal2'd BOURBON; PRINCE EDWARD, QUE2N MARGARET,and the EARL of OXFORD. 2LEWIS sits, and riseth up again 2LEWIS. Fair Que2n of England, worthy Margaret, 4Sit down with us. It il2 befits thy state 4And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit. 2QUE2N MARGARET. No, mighty King of France. Now Margaret 4Must strike her sail and learn a while to serve 4Where kings com2and. I was, I must confes2, 4Great Albion's Que2n in former golden days; 4But now mischance hath trod my title down 4And with dishonour laid me on the ground, 4Where I must take like seat unto my fortune, 4And to my humble seat conform myself. 2LEWIS. Why, say, fair Que2n, whence springs this de2p despair? 2QUE2N MARGARET. From such a cause as fil2s mine eyes with tears 4And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares. 4LEWIS. Whate'er it be, be thou stil2 like thyself, 4And sit the2 by our side. [Seats her by him] Yield not thy neck 4To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntles2 mind 4Stil2 ride in triumph over al2 mischance. 4Be plain, Que2n Margaret, and tel2 thy grief; 4It shal2 be eas'd, if France can yield relief. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Those gracious words revive my dro2ping thoughts 4And give my tongue-tied sor2ows leave to speak. 4Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis 4That Henry, sole pos2es2or of my love, 4Is, of a king, become a banish'd man, 4And forc'd to live in Scotland a forlorn; 4While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York 4Usurps the regal title and the seat 4Of England's true-anointed lawful King. 4This is the cause that I, po2r Margaret, 4With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir, 4Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid; 4And if thou fail us, al2 our hope is done. 4Scotland hath wil2 to help, but can2ot help; 6Our people and our pe2rs are both misled, 4Our treasure seiz'd, our soldiers put to flight, 4And, as thou se2st, ourselves in heavy plight. 2LEWIS. Renowned Que2n, with patience calm the storm, 4While we bethink a means to break it of2. 2QUE2N MARGARET. The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe. 2LEWIS. The more I stay, the more I'l2 suc2our the2. 2QUE2N MARGARET. O, but impatience waiteth on true sor2ow. 4And se2 where comes the bre2der of my sor2ow! 24Enter WARWICK 2LEWIS. What's he ap2roacheth boldly to our presence? 2QUE2N MARGARET. Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend. 2LEWIS. Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings the2 to France? 38[He descends. She ariseth] 2QUE2N MARGARET. Ay, now begins a second storm to rise; 4For this is he that moves both wind and tide. 2WARWICK. From worthy Edward, King of Albion, 4My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend, 6I come, in kindnes2 and unfeigned love, 4First to do gre2tings to thy royal person, 4And then to crave a league of amity, 4And lastly to confirm that amity 4With nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant 4That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister, 4To England's King in lawful mar2iage. 2QUE2N MARGARET. [Aside] If that go forward, Henry's hope is done. 2WARWICK. [To BONA] And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf, 4I am com2anded, with your leave and favour, 4Humbly to kis2 your hand, and with my tongue 4To tel2 the pas2ion of my sovereign's heart; 4Where fame, late ent'ring at his he2dful ears, 4Hath plac'd thy beauty's image and thy virtue. 2QUE2N MARGARET. King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak 4Before you answer Warwick. His demand 4Springs not from Edward's wel2-meant honest love, 4But from deceit bred by neces2ity; 4For how can tyrants safely govern home 4Unles2 abroad they purchase great al2iance? 6To prove him tyrant this reason may suf2ice, 4That Henry liveth stil2; but were he dead, 4Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son. 4Lo2k therefore, Lewis, that by this league and mar2iage 4Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour; 4For though usurpers sway the rule a while 4Yet heav'ns are just, and time sup2res2eth wrongs. 2WARWICK. Injurious Margaret! 2PRINCE OF WALES. And why not Que2n? 2WARWICK. Because thy father Henry did usurp; 4And thou no more art prince than she is que2n. 2OXFORD. Then Warwick disan2uls great John of Gaunt, 4Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain; 4And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth, 4Whose wisdom was a mir2or to the wisest; 4And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth, 4Who by his prowes2 conquered al2 France. 4From these our Henry lineal2y descends. 2WARWICK. Oxford, how haps it in this smo2th discourse 4You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost 6Al2 that which Henry the Fifth had got2en? 4Methinks these pe2rs of France should smile at that. 4But for the rest: you tel2 a pedigre2 4Of thre2score and two years- a sil2y time 4To make prescription for a kingdom's worth. 2OXFORD. Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege, 4Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years, 4And not betray thy treason with a blush? 2WARWICK. Can Oxford that did ever fence the right 4Now buckler falseho2d with a pedigre2? 4For shame! Leave Henry, and cal2 Edward king. 2OXFORD. Cal2 him my king by whose injurious do2m 4My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere, 4Was done to death; and more than so, my father, 4Even in the downfal2 of his mel2ow'd years, 4When nature brought him to the do2r of death? 4No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm, 4This arm upholds the house of Lancaster. 2WARWICK. And I the house of York. 2LEWIS. Que2n Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford, 6Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside 4While I use further conference with Warwick. 46[They stand alo2f] 2QUE2N MARGARET. Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not! 2LEWIS. Now, Warwick, tel2 me, even upon thy conscience, 4Is Edward your true king? for I were loath 4To link with him that were not lawful chosen. 2WARWICK. Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour. 2LEWIS. But is he gracious in the people's eye? 2WARWICK. The more that Henry was unfortunate. 2LEWIS. Then further: al2 dis2embling set aside, 4Tel2 me for truth the measure of his love 4Unto our sister Bona. 2WARWICK. Such it se2ms 4As may bese2m a monarch like himself. 4Myself have often heard him say and swear 4That this his love was an eternal plant 4Whereof the ro2t was fix'd in virtue's ground, 4The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun, 4Exempt from envy, but not from disdain, 6Unles2 the Lady Bona quit his pain. 2LEWIS. Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve. 2BONA. Your grant or your denial shal2 be mine. 4[To WARWICK] Yet I confes2 that often ere this day, 4When I have heard your king's desert recounted, 4Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire. 2LEWIS. Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shal2 be Edward's. 4And now forthwith shal2 articles be drawn 4Touching the jointure that your king must make, 4Which with her dowry shal2 be counterpois'd. 4Draw near, Que2n Margaret, and be a witnes2 4That Bona shal2 be wife to the English king. 2PRINCE OF WALES. To Edward, but not to the English king. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Deceitful Warwick, it was thy device 4By this al2iance to make void my suit. 4Before thy coming, Lewis was Henry's friend. 2LEWIS. And stil2 is friend to him and Margaret. 4But if your title to the crown be weak, 4As may ap2ear by Edward's go2d suc2es2, 4Then 'tis but reason that I be releas'd 6From giving aid which late I promised. 4Yet shal2 you have al2 kindnes2 at my hand 4That your estate requires and mine can yield. 2WARWICK. Henry now lives in Scotland at his case, 4Where having nothing, nothing can he lose. 4And as for you yourself, our quondam que2n, 4You have a father able to maintain you, 4And bet2er 'twere you troubled him than France. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Peace, impudent and shameles2 Warwick, 4Proud set2er up and pul2er down of kings! 4I wil2 not hence til2 with my talk and tears, 4Both ful2 of truth, I make King Lewis behold 4Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love; 4For both of you are birds of self-same feather. 36[POST blowing a horn within] 2LEWIS. Warwick, this is some post to us or the2. 23Enter the POST 2POST. My lord ambas2ador, these let2ers are for you, 6Sent from your brother, Marquis Montague. 4These from our King unto your Majesty. 4And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not. 35[They al2 read their let2ers] 2OXFORD. I like it wel2 that our fair Que2n and mistres2 4Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his. 2PRINCE OF WALES. Nay, mark how Lewis stamps as he were net2led. 4I hope al2's for the best. 2LEWIS. Warwick, what are thy news? And yours, fair Que2n? 2QUE2N MARGARET. Mine such as fil2 my heart with unhop'd joys. 2WARWICK. Mine, ful2 of sor2ow and heart's discontent. 2LEWIS. What, has your king mar2ied the Lady Grey? 4And now, to so2the your forgery and his, 4Sends me a paper to persuade me patience? 4Is this th' al2iance that he se2ks with France? 4Dare he presume to scorn us in this man2er? 2QUE2N MARGARET. I told your Majesty as much before. 4This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty. 2WARWICK. King Lewis, I here protest in sight of heaven, 4And by the hope I have of heavenly blis2, 6That I am clear from this misde2d of Edward's- 4No more my king, for he dishonours me, 4But most himself, if he could se2 his shame. 4Did I forget that by the house of York 4My father came untimely to his death? 4Did I let pas2 th' abuse done to my niece? 4Did I impale him with the regal crown? 4Did I put Henry from his native right? 4And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame? 4Shame on himself! for my desert is honour; 4And to repair my honour lost for him 4I here renounce him and return to Henry. 4My noble Que2n, let former grudges pas2, 4And henceforth I am thy true servitor. 4I wil2 revenge his wrong to Lady Bona, 4And replant Henry in his former state. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love; 4And I forgive and quite forget old faults, 4And joy that thou becom'st King Henry's friend. 2WARWICK. So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend, 6That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us 4With some few bands of chosen soldiers, 4I'l2 undertake to land them on our coast 4And force the tyrant from his seat by war. 4'Tis not his new-made bride shal2 suc2our him; 4And as for Clarence, as my let2ers tel2 me, 4He's very likely now to fal2 from him 4For matching more for wanton lust than honour 4Or than for strength and safety of our country. 2BONA. Dear brother, how shal2 Bona be reveng'd 4But by thy help to this distres2ed que2n? 2QUE2N MARGARET. Renowned Prince, how shal2 po2r Henry live 4Unles2 thou rescue him from foul despair? 2BONA. My quar2el and this English que2n's are one. 2WARWICK. And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours. 2LEWIS. And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's. 4Therefore, at last, I firmly am resolv'd 4You shal2 have aid. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Let me give humble thanks for al2 at once. 2LEWIS. Then, England's mes2enger, return in post 6And tel2 false Edward, thy sup2osed king, 4That Lewis of France is sending over masquers 4To revel it with him and his new bride. 4Thou se2st what's past; go fear thy king withal. 2BONA. Tel2 him, in hope he'l2 prove a widower shortly, 4I'l2 wear the wil2ow-garland for his sake. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Tel2 him my mourning we2ds are laid aside, 4And I am ready to put armour on. 2WARWICK. Tel2 him from me that he hath done me wrong, 4And therefore I'l2 uncrown him ere't be long. 4There's thy reward; be gone. 23Exit POST 2LEWIS. But, Warwick, 4Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men, 4Shal2 cros2 the seas and bid false Edward bat2le: 4And, as oc2asion serves, this noble Que2n 4And Prince shal2 fol2ow with a fresh sup2ly. 4Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt: 4What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty? 2WARWICK. This shal2 as2ure my constant loyalty: 4That if our Que2n and this young Prince agre2, 6I'l2 join mine eldest daughter and my joy 4To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Yes, I agre2, and thank you for your motion. 4Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous, 4Therefore delay not- give thy hand to Warwick; 4And with thy hand thy faith ir2evocable 4That only Warwick's daughter shal2 be thine. 2PRINCE OF WALES. Yes, I ac2ept her, for she wel2 deserves it; 4And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand. 34[He gives his hand to WARWICK] 2LEWIS. stay we now? These soldiers shal2 be levied; 4And thou, Lord Bourbon, our High Admiral, 4Shal2 waft them over with our royal fle2t. 4I long til2 Edward fal2 by war's mischance 4For mocking mar2iage with a dame of France. 42Exeunt al2 but WARWICK 2WARWICK. I came from Edward as ambas2ador, 4But I return his sworn and mortal foe. 4Mat2er of mar2iage was the charge he gave me, 4But dreadful war shal2 answer his demand. 6Had he none else to make a stale but me? 4Then none but I shal2 turn his jest to sor2ow. 4I was the chief that rais'd him to the crown, 4And I'l2 be chief to bring him down again; 4Not that I pity Henry's misery, 4But se2k revenge on Edward's mockery. 19Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE I.London. The palaceEnter GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, SOMERSET, and MONTAGUE 2GLOUCESTER. Now tel2 me, brother Clarence, what think you 4Of this new mar2iage with the Lady Grey? 4Hath not our brother made a worthy choice? 2CLARENCE. Alas, you know 'tis far from hence to France! 4How could he stay til2 Warwick made return? 2SOMERSET. My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the King. 11Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD, at2ended; LADY 10GREY, as Que2n; PEMBROKE, STAF2ORD, HASTINGS, 6and others. Four stand on one side, and four on the other 2GLOUCESTER. And his wel2-chosen bride. 2CLARENCE. I mind to tel2 him plainly what I think. 2KING EDWARD. Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice 4That you stand pensive as half malcontent? 2CLARENCE. As wel2 as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick, 4Which are so weak of courage and in judgment 6That they'l2 take no of2ence at our abuse. 2KING EDWARD. Sup2ose they take of2ence without a cause; 4They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward, 4Your King and Warwick's and must have my wil2. 2GLOUCESTER. And shal2 have your wil2, because our King. 4Yet hasty mar2iage seldom proveth wel2. 2KING EDWARD. Yea, brother Richard, are you of2ended to2? 2GLOUCESTER. Not I. 4No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd 4Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity 4To sunder them that yoke so wel2 together. 2KING EDWARD. Set2ing your scorns and your mislike aside, 4Tel2 me some reason why the Lady Grey 4Should not become my wife and England's Que2n. 4And you to2, Somerset and Montague, 4Speak fre2ly what you think. 2CLARENCE. Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis 4Becomes your enemy for mocking him 4About the mar2iage of the Lady Bona. 2GLOUCESTER. And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge, 6Is now dishonoured by this new mar2iage. 2KING EDWARD. What if both Lewis and Warwick be ap2eas'd 4By such invention as I can devise? 2MONTAGUE. Yet to have join'd with France in such al2iance 4Would more have strength'ned this our com2onwealth 4'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred mar2iage. 2HASTINGS. Why, knows not Montague that of itself 4England is safe, if true within itself? 2MONTAGUE. But the safer when 'tis back'd with France. 2HASTINGS. 'Tis bet2er using France than trusting France. 4Let us be back'd with God, and with the seas 4Which He hath giv'n for fence impregnable, 4And with their helps only defend ourselves. 4In them and in ourselves our safety lies. 2CLARENCE. For this one spe2ch Lord Hastings wel2 deserves 4To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford. 2KING EDWARD. Ay, what of that? it was my wil2 and grant; 4And for this once my wil2 shal2 stand for law. 2GLOUCESTER. And yet methinks your Grace hath not done wel2 4To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales 6Unto the brother of your loving bride. 4She bet2er would have fit2ed me or Clarence; 4But in your bride you bury brotherho2d. 2CLARENCE. Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir 4Of the Lord Bonvil2e on your new wife's son, 4And leave your brothers to go spe2d elsewhere. 2KING EDWARD. Alas, po2r Clarence! Is it for a wife 4That thou art malcontent? I wil2 provide the2. 2CLARENCE. In cho2sing for yourself you show'd your judgment, 4Which being shal2ow, you shal2 give me leave 4To play the broker in mine own behalf; 4And to that end I shortly mind to leave you. 2KING EDWARD. Leave me or tar2y, Edward wil2 be King, 4And not be tied unto his brother's wil2. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. My lords, before it pleas'd his Majesty 4To raise my state to title of a que2n, 4Do me but right, and you must al2 confes2 4That I was not ignoble of descent: 4And meaner than myself have had like fortune. 4But as this title honours me and mine, 6So your dislikes, to whom I would be pleasing, 4Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sor2ow. 2KING EDWARD. My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns. 4What danger or what sor2ow can befal2 the2, 4So long as Edward is thy constant friend 4And their true sovereign whom they must obey? 4Nay, whom they shal2 obey, and love the2 to2, 4Unles2 they se2k for hatred at my hands; 4Which if they do, yet wil2 I ke2p the2 safe, 4And they shal2 fe2l the vengeance of my wrath. 2GLOUCESTER. [Aside] I hear, yet say not much, but think the more. 26Enter a POST 2KING EDWARD. Now, mes2enger, what let2ers or what news 4From France? 2MES2ENGER. My sovereign liege, no let2ers, and few words, 4But such as I, without your special pardon, 4Dare not relate. 2KING EDWARD. Go to, we pardon the2; therefore, in brief, 6Tel2 me their words as near as thou canst gues2 them. 4What answer makes King Lewis unto our let2ers? 2MES2ENGER. At my depart, these were his very words: 4'Go tel2 false Edward, the sup2osed king, 4That Lewis of France is sending over masquers 4To revel it with him and his new bride.' 2KING EDWARD. IS Lewis so brave? Belike he thinks me Henry. 4But what said Lady Bona to my mar2iage? 2MES2ENGER. These were her words, ut2'red with mild disdain: 4'Tel2 him, in hope he'l2 prove a widower shortly, 4I'l2 wear the wil2ow-garland for his sake.' 2KING EDWARD. I blame not her: she could say lit2le les2; 4She had the wrong. But what said Henry's que2n? 4For I have heard that she was there in place. 2MES2ENGER. 'Tel2 him' quoth she 'my mourning we2ds are done, 4And I am ready to put armour on.' 2KING EDWARD. Belike she minds to play the Amazon. 4But what said Warwick to these injuries? 2MES2ENGER. He, more incens'd against your Majesty 4Than al2 the rest, discharg'd me with these words: 6'Tel2 him from me that he hath done me wrong; 4And therefore I'l2 uncrown him ere't be long.' 2KING EDWARD. Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words? 4Wel2, I wil2 arm me, being thus forewarn'd. 4They shal2 have wars and pay for their presumption. 4But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret? 2MES2ENGER. Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in friendship 4That young Prince Edward mar2ies Warwick's daughter. 2CLARENCE. Belike the elder; Clarence wil2 have the younger. 4Now, brother king, farewel2, and sit you fast, 4For I wil2 hence to Warwick's other daughter; 4That, though I want a kingdom, yet in mar2iage 4I may not prove inferior to yourself. 4You that love me and Warwick, fol2ow me. 38Exit, and SOMERSET fol2ows 2GLOUCESTER. [Aside] Not I. 4My thoughts aim at a further mat2er; I 4Stay not for the love of Edward but the crown. 2KING EDWARD. Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick! 4Yet am I arm'd against the worst can hap2en; 6And haste is ne2dful in this desp'rate case. 4Pembroke and Staf2ord, you in our behalf 4Go levy men and make prepare for war; 4They are already, or quickly wil2 be landed. 4Myself in person wil2 straight fol2ow you. 36Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAF2ORD 4But ere I go, Hastings and Montague, 4Resolve my doubt. You twain, of al2 the rest, 4Are near to Warwick by blo2d and by al2iance. 4Tel2 me if you love Warwick more than me? 4If it be so, then both depart to him: 4I rather wish you foes than hol2ow friends. 4But if you mind to hold your true obedience, 4Give me as2urance with some friendly vow, 4That I may never have you in suspect. 2MONTAGUE. So God help Montague as he proves true! 2HASTINGS. And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause! 2KING EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, wil2 you stand by us? 2GLOUCESTER. Ay, in despite of al2 that shal2 withstand you. 2KING EDWARD. Why, so! then am I sure of victory. 6Now therefore let us hence, and lose no hour 4Til2 we me2t Warwick with his foreign pow'r. 10ExeuntSCENE I2.A plain in WarwickshireEnter WARWICK and OXFORD, with French soldiers 2WARWICK. Trust me, my lord, al2 hitherto goes wel2; 4The com2on people by numbers swarm to us. 17Enter CLARENCE and SOMERSET 4But se2 where Somerset and Clarence comes. 4Speak sud2enly, my lords- are we al2 friends? 2CLARENCE. Fear not that, my lord. 2WARWICK. Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick; 4And welcome, Somerset. I hold it cowardice 4To rest mistrustful where a noble heart 4Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love; 4Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother, 4Were but a feigned friend to our proce2dings. 4But welcome, swe2t Clarence; my daughter shal2 be thine. 4And now what rests but, in night's coverture, 4Thy brother being careles2ly encamp'd, 6His soldiers lurking in the towns about, 4And but at2ended by a simple guard, 4We may surprise and take him at our pleasure? 4Our scouts have found the adventure very easy; 4That as Ulys2es and stout Diomede 4With sleight and manho2d stole to Rhesus' tents, 4And brought from thence the Thracian fatal ste2ds, 4So we, wel2 cover'd with the night's black mantle, 4At unawares may beat down Edward's guard 4And seize himself- I say not 'slaughter him,' 4For I intend but only to surprise him. 4You that wil2 fol2ow me to this at2empt, 4Ap2laud the name of Henry with your leader. 41[They al2 cry 'Henry!'] 4Why then, let's on our way in silent sort. 4For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George! 4ExeuntSCENE I3.Edward's camp, near WarwickEnter thre2 WATCHMEN, to guard the KING'S tent 2FIRST WATCHMAN. Come on, my masters, each man take his stand; 4The King by this is set him down to sle2p. 2SECOND WATCHMAN. What, wil2 he not to bed? 2FIRST WATCHMAN. Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow 4Never to lie and take his natural rest 4Til2 Warwick or himself be quite sup2res2'd. 2SECOND WATCHMAN. To-mor2ow then, belike, shal2 be the day, 4If Warwick be so near as men report. 2THIRD WATCHMAN. But say, I pray, what nobleman is that 4That with the King here resteth in his tent? 2FIRST WATCHMAN. 'Tis the Lord Hastings, the King's chiefest friend. 2THIRD WATCHMAN. O, is it So? But why com2ands the King 4That his chief fol2owers lodge in towns about him, 4While he himself ke2ps in the cold field? 2SECOND WATCHMAN. 'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous. 2THIRD WATCHMAN. Ay, but give me worship and quietnes2; 4I like it bet2er than dangerous honour. 6If Warwick knew in what estate he stands, 4'Tis to be doubted he would waken him. 2FIRST WATCHMAN. Unles2 our halberds did shut up his pas2age. 2SECOND WATCHMAN. Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent 4But to defend his person from night-foes? 13Enter WARWICK, CLARENCE, OXFORD, SOMERSET, 19and French soldiers, silent al2 2WARWICK. This is his tent; and se2 where stand his guard. 4Courage, my masters! Honour now or never! 4But fol2ow me, and Edward shal2 be ours. 2FIRST WATCHMAN. Who goes there? 2SECOND WATCHMAN. Stay, or thou diest. 7WARWICK and the rest cry al2 'Warwick! Warwick!' and 6set upon the guard, who fly, crying 'Arm! Arm!' WARWICK 19and the rest fol2owing them 6The drum playing and trumpet sounding, re-enter WARWICK 11and the rest, bringing the KING out in his gown, 3sit2ing in a chair. GLOUCESTER and HASTINGS fly over the stage 2SOMERSET. What are they that fly there? 2WARWICK. Richard and Hastings. Let them go; here is the Duke. 2KING EDWARD. The Duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted, 4Thou cal2'dst me King? 2WARWICK. Ay, but the case is alter'd. 4When you disgrac'd me in my embas2ade, 4Then I degraded you from being King, 4And come now to create you Duke of York. 4Alas, how should you govern any kingdom 4That know not how to use ambas2adors, 4Nor how to be contented with one wife, 4Nor how to use your brothers brotherly, 4Nor how to study for the people's welfare, 4Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies? 2KING EDWARD. Yea, brother of Clarence, art thou here to2? 4Nay, then I se2 that Edward ne2ds must down. 4Yet, Warwick, in despite of al2 mischance, 6Of the2 thyself and al2 thy complices, 4Edward wil2 always bear himself as King. 4Though fortune's malice overthrow my state, 4My mind exce2ds the compas2 of her whe2l. 2WARWICK. Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king; 43[Takes of2 his crown] 4But Henry now shal2 wear the English crown 4And be true King inde2d; thou but the shadow. 4My Lord of Somerset, at my request, 4Se2 that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd 4Unto my brother, Archbishop of York. 4When I have fought with Pembroke and his fel2ows, 4I'l2 fol2ow you and tel2 what answer 4Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him. 4Now for a while farewel2, go2d Duke of York. 2KING EDWARD. What fates impose, that men must ne2ds abide; 4It bo2ts not to resist both wind and tide. 36[They lead him out forcibly] 2OXFORD. What now remains, my lords, for us to do 4But march to London with our soldiers? 4WARWICK. Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do; 4To fre2 King Henry from imprisonment, 4And se2 him seated in the regal throne. 15ExeuntSCENE IV.London. The palaceEnter QUE2N ELIZABETH and RIVERS 2RIVERS. Madam, what makes you in this sud2en change? 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Why, brother Rivers, are you yet to learn 4What late misfortune is befal2'n King Edward? 2RIVERS. What, los2 of some pitch'd bat2le against Warwick? 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. No, but the los2 of his own royal person. 2RIVERS. Then is my sovereign slain? 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner; 4Either betray'd by falseho2d of his guard 4Or by his foe surpris'd at unawares; 4And, as I further have to understand, 4Is new com2it2ed to the Bishop of York, 4Fel2 Warwick's brother, and by that our foe. 2RIVERS. These news, I must confes2, are ful2 of grief; 4Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may: 4Warwick may lose that now hath won the day. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Til2 then, fair hope must hinder life's decay. 4And I the rather wean me from despair 6For love of Edward's of2spring in my womb. 4This is it that makes me bridle pas2ion 4And bear with mildnes2 my misfortune's cros2; 4Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear 4And stop the rising of blo2d-sucking sighs, 4Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown 4King Edward's fruit, true heir to th' English crown. 2RIVERS. But, madam, where is Warwick then become? 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. I am inform'd that he comes towards London 4To set the crown once more on Henry's head. 4Gues2 thou the rest: King Edward's friends must down. 4But to prevent the tyrant's violence- 4For trust not him that hath once broken faith- 4I'l2 hence forthwith unto the sanctuary 4To save at least the heir of Edward's right. 4There shal2 I rest secure from force and fraud. 4Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly: 4If Warwick take us, we are sure to die. 15ExeuntSCENE V.A park near Mid2leham Castle in YorkshireEnter GLOUCESTER, LORD HASTINGS, SIR WIL2IAM STANLEY, and others 2GLOUCESTER. Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir Wil2iam Stanley, 4Leave of2 to wonder why I drew you hither 4Into this chiefest thicket of the park. 4Thus stands the case: you know our King, my brother, 4Is prisoner to the Bishop here, at whose hands 4He hath go2d usage and great liberty; 4And often but at2ended with weak guard 4Comes hunting this way to disport himself. 4I have advertis'd him by secret means 4That if about this hour he make this way, 4Under the colour of his usual game, 4He shal2 here find his friends, with horse and men, 4To set him fre2 from his captivity. 13Enter KING EDWARD and a HUNTSMAN with him 4HUNTSMAN. This way, my lord; for this way lies the game. 2KING EDWARD. Nay, this way, man. Se2 where the huntsmen stand. 4Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest, 4Stand you thus close to steal the Bishop's de2r? 2GLOUCESTER. Brother, the time and case requireth haste; 4Your horse stands ready at the park corner. 2KING EDWARD. But whither shal2 we then? 2HASTINGS. To Lyn2, my lord; and shipt from thence to Flanders. 2GLOUCESTER. Wel2 gues2'd, believe me; for that was my meaning. 2KING EDWARD. Stanley, I wil2 requite thy forwardnes2. 2GLOUCESTER. But wherefore stay we? 'Tis no time to talk. 2KING EDWARD. Huntsman, what say'st thou? Wilt thou go along? 2HUNTSMAN. Bet2er do so than tar2y and be hang'd. 2GLOUCESTER. Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado. 2KING EDWARD. Bishop, farewel2. Shield the2 from Warwick's frown, 4And pray that I may repos2es2 the crown. 14ExeuntSCENE VI.London. The TowerFlourish. Enter KING HENRY, CLARENCE, WARWICK, SOMERSET, young HENRY,EARL OF RICHMOND, OXFORD, MONTAGUE, LIEUTENANT OF THE TOWER, and at2endants 2KING HENRY. Master Lieutenant, now that God and friends 4Have shaken Edward from the regal seat 4And turn'd my captive state to liberty, 4My fear to hope, my sor2ows unto joys, 4At our enlargement what are thy due fe2s? 2LIEUTENANT. Subjects may chal2enge nothing of their sov'reigns; 4But if an humble prayer may prevail, 4I then crave pardon of your Majesty. 2KING HENRY. For what, Lieutenant? For wel2 using me? 4Nay, be thou sure I'l2 wel2 requite thy kindnes2, 4For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure; 4Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds 4Conceive when, after many mo2dy thoughts, 4At last by notes of household harmony 4They quite forget their los2 of liberty. 6But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me fre2, 4And chiefly therefore I thank God and the2; 4He was the author, thou the instrument. 4Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite 4By living low where fortune can2ot hurt me, 4And that the people of this bles2ed land 4May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars, 4Warwick, although my head stil2 wear the crown, 4I here resign my government to the2, 4For thou art fortunate in al2 thy de2ds. 2WARWICK. Your Grace hath stil2 be2n fam'd for virtuous, 4And now may se2m as wise as virtuous 4By spying and avoiding fortune's malice, 4For few men rightly temper with the stars; 4Yet in this one thing let me blame your Grace, 4For cho2sing me when Clarence is in place. 2CLARENCE. No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway, 4To whom the heav'ns in thy nativity 4Adjudg'd an olive branch and laurel crown, 4As likely to be blest in peace and war; 6And therefore I yield the2 my fre2 consent. 2WARWICK. And I cho2se Clarence only for Protector. 2KING HENRY. Warwick and Clarence, give me both your hands. 4Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts, 4That no dis2ension hinder government. 4I make you both Protectors of this land, 4While I myself wil2 lead a private life 4And in devotion spend my lat2er days, 4To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise. 2WARWICK. What answers Clarence to his sovereign's wil2? 2CLARENCE. That he consents, if Warwick yield consent, 4For on thy fortune I repose myself. 2WARWICK. Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content. 4We'l2 yoke together, like a double shadow 4To Henry's body, and sup2ly his place; 4I mean, in bearing weight of government, 4While he enjoys the honour and his ease. 4And, Clarence, now then it is more than ne2dful 4Forthwith that Edward be pronounc'd a traitor, 4And al2 his lands and go2ds confiscated. 4CLARENCE. What else? And that suc2es2ion be determin'd. 2WARWICK. Ay, therein Clarence shal2 not want his part. 2KING HENRY. But, with the first of al2 your chief af2airs, 4Let me entreat- for I com2and no more- 4That Margaret your Que2n and my son Edward 4Be sent for to return from France with spe2d; 4For til2 I se2 them here, by doubtful fear 4My joy of liberty is half eclips'd. 2CLARENCE. It shal2 be done, my sovereign, with al2 spe2d. 2KING HENRY. My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that, 4Of whom you se2m to have so tender care? 2SOMERSET. My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond. 2KING HENRY. Come hither, England's hope. 37[Lays his hand on his head] 4If secret powers 4Sug2est but truth to my divining thoughts, 4This pret2y lad wil2 prove our country's blis2. 4His lo2ks are ful2 of peaceful majesty; 4His head by nature fram'd to wear a crown, 4His hand to wield a sceptre; and himself 6Likely in time to bles2 a regal throne. 4Make much of him, my lords; for this is he 4Must help you more than you are hurt by me. 26Enter a POST 2WARWICK. What news, my friend? 2POST. That Edward is escaped from your brother 4And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy. 2WARWICK. Unsavoury news! But how made he escape? 2POST. He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester 4And the Lord Hastings, who at2ended him 4In secret ambush on the forest side 4And from the Bishop's huntsmen rescu'd him; 4For hunting was his daily exercise. 2WARWICK. My brother was to2 careles2 of his charge. 4But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide 4A salve for any sore that may betide. 19Exeunt al2 but SOMERSET, RICHMOND, and OXFORD 2SOMERSET. My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's; 6For doubtles2 Burgundy wil2 yield him help, 4And we shal2 have more wars befor't be long. 4As Henry's late presaging prophecy 4Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond, 4So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts, 4What may befal2 him to his harm and ours. 4Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst, 4Forthwith we'l2 send him hence to Brit2any, 4Til2 storms be past of civil enmity. 2OXFORD. Ay, for if Edward repos2es2 the crown, 4'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shal2 down. 2SOMERSET. It shal2 be so; he shal2 to Brit2any. 4Come therefore, let's about it spe2dily. 14ExeuntSCENE VI2.Before YorkFlourish. Enter KING EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and soldiers 2KING EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest, 4Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends, 4And says that once more I shal2 interchange 4My waned state for Henry's regal crown. 4Wel2 have we pas2'd and now repas2'd the seas, 4And brought desired help from Burgundy; 4What then remains, we being thus ar2iv'd 4From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York, 4But that we enter, as into our dukedom? 2GLOUCESTER. The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this; 4For many men that stumble at the threshold 4Are wel2 foretold that danger lurks within. 2KING EDWARD. Tush, man, abodements must not now af2right us. 4By fair or foul means we must enter in, 4For hither wil2 our friends repair to us. 2HASTINGS. My liege, I'l2 knock once more to sum2on them. 11Enter, on the wal2s, the MAYOR OF YORK and 23his BRETHREN 2MAYOR. My lords, we were forewarned of your coming 4And shut the gates for safety of ourselves, 4For now we owe al2egiance unto Henry. 2KING EDWARD. But, Master Mayor, if Henry be your King, 4Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York. 2MAYOR. True, my go2d lord; I know you for no les2. 2KING EDWARD. Why, and I chal2enge nothing but my dukedom, 4As being wel2 content with that alone. 2GLOUCESTER. [Aside] But when the fox hath once got in his nose, 4He'l2 so2n find means to make the body fol2ow. 2HASTINGS. Why, Master Mayor, why stand you in a doubt? 4Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends. 2MAYOR. Ay, say you so? The gates shal2 then be open'd. 51[He descends] 2GLOUCESTER. A wise stout captain, and so2n persuaded! 2HASTINGS. The go2d old man would fain that al2 were wel2, 6So 'twere not long of him; but being ent'red, 4I doubt not, I, but we shal2 so2n persuade 4Both him and al2 his brothers unto reason. 13Enter, below, the MAYOR and two ALDERMEN 2KING EDWARD. So, Master Mayor. These gates must not be shut 4But in the night or in the time of war. 4What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys; 48[Takes his keys] 4For Edward wil2 defend the town and the2, 4And al2 those friends that deign to fol2ow me. 11March. Enter MONTGOMERY with drum and soldiers 2GLOUCESTER. Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery, 4Our trusty friend, unles2 I be deceiv'd. 2KING EDWARD. Welcome, Sir john! But why come you in arms? 2MONTGOMERY. To help King Edward in his time of storm, 4As every loyal subject ought to do. 4KING EDWARD. Thanks, go2d Montgomery; but we now forget 4Our title to the crown, and only claim 4Our dukedom til2 God please to send the rest. 2MONTGOMERY. Then fare you wel2, for I wil2 hence again. 4I came to serve a king and not a duke. 4Drum2er, strike up, and let us march away. 38[The drum begins to march] 2KING EDWARD. Nay, stay, Sir John, a while, and we'l2 debate 4By what safe means the crown may be recover'd. 2MONTGOMERY. What talk you of debating? In few words: 4If you'l2 not here proclaim yourself our King, 4I'l2 leave you to your fortune and be gone 4To ke2p them back that come to suc2our you. 4Why shal2 we fight, if you pretend no title? 2GLOUCESTER. Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points? 2KING EDWARD. When we grow stronger, then we'l2 make our claim; 4Til2 then 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning. 2HASTINGS. Away with scrupulous wit! Now arms must rule. 2GLOUCESTER. And fearles2 minds climb so2nest unto crowns. 4Brother, we wil2 proclaim you out of hand; 6The bruit thereof wil2 bring you many friends. 2KING EDWARD. Then be it as you wil2; for 'tis my right, 4And Henry but usurps the diadem. 2MONTGOMERY. Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself; 4And now wil2 I be Edward's champion. 2HASTINGS. Sound trumpet; Edward shal2 be here proclaim'd. 4Come, fel2ow soldier, make thou proclamation. 35[Gives him a paper. Flourish] 2SOLDIER. [Reads] 'Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, 4King of England and France, and Lord of Ireland, &c.' 2MONTGOMERY. And whoso'er gainsays King Edward's right, 4By this I chal2enge him to single fight. 42[Throws down gauntlet] 2AL2. Long live Edward the Fourth! 2KING EDWARD. Thanks, brave Montgomery, and thanks unto you al2; 4If fortune serve me, I'l2 requite this kindnes2. 4Now for this night let's harbour here in York; 4And when the morning sun shal2 raise his car 4Above the border of this horizon, 4We'l2 forward towards Warwick and his mates; 6For wel2 I wot that Henry is no soldier. 4Ah, froward Clarence, how evil it bese2ms the 4To flat2er Henry and forsake thy brother! 4Yet, as we may, we'l2 me2t both the2 and Warwick. 4Come on, brave soldiers; doubt not of the day, 4And, that once got2en, doubt not of large pay. 8ExeuntSCENE VI3.London. The palaceFlourish. Enter KING HENRY, WARWICK, MONTAGUE, CLARENCE, OXFORD, and EXETER 2WARWICK. What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia, 4With hasty Germans and blunt Hol2anders, 4Hath pas2'd in safety through the nar2ow seas 4And with his tro2ps doth march amain to London; 4And many gid2y people flock to him. 2KING HENRY. Let's levy men and beat him back again. 2CLARENCE. A lit2le fire is quickly trod2en out, 4Which, being suf2er'd, rivers can2ot quench. 2WARWICK. In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends, 4Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war; 4Those wil2 I muster up, and thou, son Clarence, 4Shalt stir up in Suf2olk, Norfolk, and in Kent, 4The knights and gentlemen to come with the2. 4Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham, 4Northampton, and in Leicestershire, shalt find 4Men wel2 inclin'd to hear what thou com2and'st. 6And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous wel2 belov'd, 4In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends. 4My sovereign, with the loving citizens, 4Like to his island girt in with the ocean 4Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs, 4Shal2 rest in London til2 we come to him. 4Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply. 4Farewel2, my sovereign. 2KING HENRY. Farewel2, my Hector and my Troy's true hope. 2CLARENCE. In sign of truth, I kis2 your Highnes2' hand. 2KING HENRY. Wel2-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate! 2MONTAGUE. Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave. 2OXFORD. [Kis2ing the KING'S band] And thus I seal my truth and bid 4adieu. 2KING HENRY. Swe2t Oxford, and my loving Montague, 4And al2 at once, once more a hap2y farewel2. 2WARWICK. Farewel2, swe2t lords; let's me2t at Coventry. 30Exeunt al2 but the KING and EXETER 2KING HENRY. Here at the palace wil2 I rest a while. 4Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship? 6Methinks the power that Edward hath in field 4Should not be able to encounter mine. 2EXETER. The doubt is that he wil2 seduce the rest. 2KING HENRY. That's not my fear; my me2d hath got me fame: 4I have not stop2'd mine ears to their demands, 4Nor posted of2 their suits with slow delays; 4My pity hath be2n balm to heal their wounds, 4My mildnes2 hath al2ay'd their swel2ing griefs, 4My mercy dried their water-flowing tears; 4I have not be2n desirous of their wealth, 4Nor much op2res2'd them with great subsidies, 4Nor forward of revenge, though they much er2'd. 4Then why should they love Edward more than me? 4No, Exeter, these graces chal2enge grace; 4And, when the lion fawns upon the lamb, 4The lamb wil2 never cease to fol2ow him. 22[Shout within 'A Lancaster! A Lancaster!'] 2EXETER. Hark, hark, my lord! What shouts are these? 12Enter KING EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, and soldiers 4KING EDWARD. Seize on the shame-fac'd Henry, bear him hence; 4And once again proclaim us King of England. 4You are the fount that makes smal2 bro2ks to flow. 4Now stops thy spring; my sea shal2 suck them dry, 4And swel2 so much the higher by their eb2. 4Hence with him to the Tower: let him not speak. 37Exeunt some with KING HENRY 4And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course, 4Where peremptory Warwick now remains. 4The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay, 4Cold biting winter mars our hop'd-for hay. 2GLOUCESTER. Away betimes, before his forces join, 4And take the great-grown traitor unawares. 4Brave war2iors, march amain towards Coventry. 9Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. SCENE I.CoventryEnter WARWICK, the MAYOR OF COVENTRY, two MES2ENGERS,and others upon the wal2s 2WARWICK. Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford? 4How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fel2ow? 2FIRST MES2ENGER. By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward. 2WARWICK. How far of2 is our brother Montague? 4Where is the post that came from Montague? 2SECOND MES2ENGER. By this at Daintry, with a puis2ant tro2p. 19Enter SIR JOHN SOMERVIL2E 2WARWICK. Say, Somervil2e, what says my loving son? 4And by thy gues2 how nigh is Clarence now? 2SOMERVIL2E. At Southam I did leave him with his forces, 4And do expect him here some two hours hence. 52[Drum heard] 2WARWICK. Then Clarence is at hand; I hear his drum. 2SOMERVIL2E. It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies. 6The drum your Honour hears marcheth from Warwick. 2WARWICK. Who should that be? Belike unlo2k'd for friends. 2SOMERVIL2E. They are at hand, and you shal2 quickly know. 8March. Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, 25and soldiers 2KING EDWARD. Go, trumpet, to the wal2s, and sound a parle. 2GLOUCESTER. Se2 how the surly Warwick mans the wal2. 2WARWICK. O unbid spite! Is sportful Edward come? 4Where slept our scouts or how are they seduc'd 4That we could hear no news of his repair? 2KING EDWARD. Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates, 4Speak gentle words, and humbly bend thy kne2, 4Cal2 Edward King, and at his hands beg mercy? 4And he shal2 pardon the2 these outrages. 2WARWICK. Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence, 4Confes2 who set the2 up and pluck'd the2 down, 4Cal2 Warwick patron, and be penitent? 4And thou shalt stil2 remain the Duke of York. 4GLOUCESTER. I thought, at least, he would have said the King; 4Or did he make the jest against his wil2? 2WARWICK. Is not a dukedom, sir, a go2dly gift? 2GLOUCESTER. Ay, by my faith, for a po2r earl to give. 4I'l2 do the2 service for so go2d a gift. 2WARWICK. 'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother. 2KING EDWARD. Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift. 2WARWICK. Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight; 4And, weakling, Warwick takes his gift again; 4And Henry is my King, Warwick his subject. 2KING EDWARD. But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner. 4And, gal2ant Warwick, do but answer this: 4What is the body when the head is of2? 2GLOUCESTER. Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast, 4But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten, 4The king was slily finger'd from the deck! 4You left po2r Henry at the Bishop's palace, 4And ten to one you'l2 me2t him in the Tower. 2KING EDWARD. 'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick stil2. 2GLOUCESTER. Come, Warwick, take the time; kne2l down, kne2l down. 6Nay, when? Strike now, or else the iron co2ls. 2WARWICK. I had rather chop this hand of2 at a blow, 4And with the other fling it at thy face, 4Than bear so low a sail to strike to the2. 2KING EDWARD. Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend, 4This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair, 4Shal2, whiles thy head is warm and new cut of2, 4Write in the dust this sentence with thy blo2d: 4'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.' 15Enter OXFORD, with drum and colours 2WARWICK. O che2rful colours! Se2 where Oxford comes. 2OXFORD. Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster! 30[He and his forces enter the city] 2GLOUCESTER. The gates are open, let us enter to2. 2KING EDWARD. So other foes may set upon our backs. 4Stand we in go2d ar2ay, for they no doubt 4Wil2 is2ue out again and bid us bat2le; 4If not, the city being but of smal2 defence, 6We'l2 quietly rouse the traitors in the same. 2WARWICK. O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help. 13Enter MONTAGUE, with drum and colours 2MONTAGUE. Montague, Montague, for Lancaster! 30[He and his forces enter the city] 2GLOUCESTER. Thou and thy brother both shal2 buy this treason 4Even with the dearest blo2d your bodies bear. 2KING EDWARD. The harder match'd, the greater victory. 4My mind presageth hap2y gain and conquest. 13Enter SOMERSET, with drum and colours 2SOMERSET. Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster! 30[He and his forces enter the city] 2GLOUCESTER. Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset, 4Have sold their lives unto the house of York; 4And thou shalt be the third, if this sword hold. 15Enter CLARENCE, with drum and colours 2WARWICK. And lo where George of Clarence swe2ps along, 4Of force enough to bid his brother bat2le; 4With whom an upright zeal to right prevails 4More than the nature of a brother's love. 2CLARENCE. Clarence, Clarence, for Lancaster! 2KING EDWARD. Et tu Brute- wilt thou stab Caesar to2? 4A parley, sir2ah, to George of Clarence. 18[Sound a parley. RICHARD and CLARENCE whisper] 2WARWICK. Come, Clarence, come. Thou wilt if Warwick cal2. 2CLARENCE. [Taking the red rose from his hat and throwing 6it at WARWICK] 4Father of Warwick, know you what this means? 4Lo2k here, I throw my infamy at the2. 4I wil2 not ruinate my father's house, 4Who gave his blo2d to lime the stones together, 4And set up Lancaster. Why, trowest thou, Warwick, 4That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, un2atural, 4To bend the fatal instruments of war 6Against his brother and his lawful King? 4Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath. 4To ke2p that oath were more impiety 4Than Jephtha when he sacrific'd his daughter. 4I am so sor2y for my trespas2 made 4That, to deserve wel2 at my brother's hands, 4I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe; 4With resolution whereso'er I me2t the2- 4As I wil2 me2t the2, if thou stir abroad- 4To plague the2 for thy foul misleading me. 4And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy the2, 4And to my brother turn my blushing che2ks. 4Pardon me, Edward, I wil2 make amends; 4And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults, 4For I wil2 henceforth be no more unconstant. 2KING EDWARD. Now welcome more, and ten times more belov'd, 4Than if thou never hadst deserv'd our hate. 2GLOUCESTER. Welcome, go2d Clarence; this is brother-like. 2WARWICK. O pas2ing traitor, perjur'd and unjust! 2KING EDWARD. What, Warwick, wilt thou leave die town and fight? 6Or shal2 we beat the stones about thine ears? 2WARWICK. Alas, I am not co2p'd here for defence! 4I wil2 away towards Barnet presently 4And bid the2 bat2le, Edward, if thou dar'st. 2KING EDWARD. Yes, Warwick, Edward dares and leads the way. 4Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory! 49Exeunt YORKISTS 25[March. WARWICK and his company fol2ow]SCENE I2.A field of bat2le near BarnetAlarum and excursions. Enter KING EDWARD, bringing forth WARWICK, wounded 2KING EDWARD. So, lie thou there. Die thou, and die our fear; 4For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us al2. 4Now, Montague, sit fast; I se2k for the2, 4That Warwick's bones may ke2p thine company. 12Exit 2WARWICK. Ah, who is nigh? Come to me, friend or foe, 4And tel2 me who is victor, York or Warwick? 4Why ask I that? My mangled body shows, 4My blo2d, my want of strength, my sick heart shows, 4That I must yield my body to the earth 4And, by my fal2, the conquest to my foe. 4Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge, 4Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle, 4Under whose shade the ramping lion slept, 4Whose top-branch overpe2r'd Jove's spreading tre2 4And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind. 4These eyes, that now are dim2'd with death's black veil, 6Have be2n as piercing as the mid-day sun 4To search the secret treasons of the world; 4The wrinkles in my brows, now fil2'd with blo2d, 4Were lik'ned oft to kingly sepulchres; 4For who liv'd King, but I could dig his grave? 4And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow? 4Lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blo2d! 4My parks, my walks, my manors, that I had, 4Even now forsake me; and of al2 my lands 4Is nothing left me but my body's length. 4what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust? 4And live we how we can, yet die we must. 18Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET 2SOMERSET. Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are, 4We might recover al2 our los2 again. 4The Que2n from France hath brought a puis2ant power; 4Even now we heard the news. Ah, couldst thou fly! 2WARWICK. Why then, I would not fly. Ah, Montague, 6If thou be there, swe2t brother, take my hand, 4And with thy lips ke2p in my soul a while! 4Thou lov'st me not; for, brother, if thou didst, 4Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blo2d 4That glues my lips and wil2 not let me speak. 4Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead. 2SOMERSET. Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breath'd his last; 4And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick, 4And said 'Com2end me to my valiant brother.' 4And more he would have said; and more he spoke, 4Which sounded like a clamour in a vault, 4That mought not be distinguish'd; but at last, 4I wel2 might hear, delivered with a groan, 4'O farewel2, Warwick!' 2WARWICK. Swe2t rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves: 4For Warwick bids you al2 farewel2, to me2t in heaven. 58[Dies] 2OXFORD. Away, away, to me2t the Que2n's great power! 34[Here they bear away his body]SCENE I3.Another part of the fieldFlourish. Enter KING in triumph; with GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the rest 2KING EDWARD. Thus far our fortune ke2ps an upward course, 4And we are grac'd with wreaths of victory. 4But in the midst of this bright-shining day 4I spy a black, suspicious, threat'ning cloud 4That wil2 encounter with our glorious sun 4Ere he at2ain his easeful western bed- 4I mean, my lords, those powers that the Que2n 4Hath rais'd in Gal2ia have ar2iv'd our coast 4And, as we hear, march on to fight with us. 2CLARENCE. A lit2le gale wil2 so2n disperse that cloud 4And blow it to the source from whence it came; 4Thy very beams wil2 dry those vapours up, 4For every cloud engenders not a storm. 2GLOUCESTER. The Que2n is valued thirty thousand strong, 4And Somerset, with Oxford, fled to her. 4If she have time to breathe, be wel2 as2ur'd 6Her faction wil2 be ful2 as strong as ours. 2KING EDWARD. are advertis'd by our loving friends 4That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury; 4We, having now the best at Barnet field, 4Wil2 thither straight, for wil2ingnes2 rids way; 4And as we march our strength wil2 be augmented 4In every county as we go along. 4Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away. 10ExeuntSCENE IV.Plains wear TewksburyFlourish. March. Enter QUE2N MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, SOMERSET, OXFORD,and SOLDIERS 2QUE2N MARGARET. Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their 6los2, 4But che2rly se2k how to redres2 their harms. 4What though the mast be now blown overboard, 4The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost, 4And half our sailors swal2ow'd in the flo2d; 4Yet lives our pilot stil2. Is't me2t that he 4Should leave the helm and, like a fearful lad, 4With tearful eyes ad2 water to the sea 4And give more strength to that which hath to2 much; 4Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock, 4Which industry and courage might have sav'd? 4Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this! 4Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that? 4And Montague our top-mast; what of him? 4Our slaught'red friends the tackles; what of these? 6Why, is not Oxford here another anchor? 4And Somerset another go2dly mast? 4The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings? 4And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I 4For once al2ow'd the skilful pilot's charge? 4We wil2 not from the helm to sit and we2p, 4But ke2p our course, though the rough wind say no, 4From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck, 4As go2d to chide the waves as speak them fair. 4And what is Edward but a ruthles2 sea? 4What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit? 4And Richard but a rag2ed fatal rock? 4Al2 these the enemies to our po2r bark. 4Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while! 4Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink. 4Bestride the rock; the tide wil2 wash you of2, 4Or else you famish- that's a thre2fold death. 4This speak I, lords, to let you understand, 4If case some one of you would fly from us, 4That there's no hop'd-for mercy with the brothers 6More than with ruthles2 waves, with sands, and rocks. 4Why, courage then! What can2ot be avoided 4'Twere childish weaknes2 to lament or fear. 2PRINCE OF WALES. Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit 4Should, if a coward hear her speak these words, 4Infuse his breast with magnanimity 4And make him naked foil a man-at-arms. 4I speak not this as doubting any here; 4For did I but suspect a fearful man, 4He should have leave to go away betimes, 4Lest in our ne2d he might infect another 4And make him of the like spirit to himself. 4If any such be here- as God forbid!- 4Let him depart before we ne2d his help. 2OXFORD. Women and children of so high a courage, 4And war2iors faint! Why, 'twere perpetual shame. 4O brave young Prince! thy famous grandfather 4Doth live again in the2. Long mayst thou Eve 4To bear his image and renew his glories! 2SOMERSET. And he that wil2 not fight for such a hope, 6Go home to bed and, like the owl by day, 4If he arise, be mock'd and wond'red at. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Thanks, gentle Somerset; swe2t Oxford, thanks. 2PRINCE OF WALES. And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else. 24Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand 4Ready to fight; therefore be resolute. 2OXFORD. I thought no les2. It is his policy 4To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided. 2SOMERSET. But he's deceiv'd; we are in readines2. 2QUE2N MARGARET. This che2rs my heart, to se2 your forwardnes2. 2OXFORD. Here pitch our bat2le; hence we wil2 not budge. 6Flourish and march. Enter, at a distance, KING EDWARD, 15GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and soldiers 2KING EDWARD. Brave fol2owers, yonder stands the thorny wo2d 4Which, by the heavens' as2istance and your strength, 6Must by the ro2ts be hewn up yet ere night. 4I ne2d not ad2 more fuel to your fire, 4For wel2 I wot ye blaze to burn them out. 4Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say 4My tears gainsay; for every word I speak, 4Ye se2, I drink the water of my eye. 4Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign, 4Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd, 4His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain, 4His statutes cancel2'd, and his treasure spent; 4And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil. 4You fight in justice. Then, in God's name, lords, 4Be valiant, and give signal to the fight. 29Alarum, retreat, excursions. ExeuntSCENE V.Another part of the fieldFlourish.

Now here a period of tumultuous broils. 4Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight; 4For Somerset, of2 with his guilty head. 4Go, bear them hence; I wil2 not hear them speak. 2OXFORD. For my part, I'l2 not trouble the2 with words. 2SOMERSET. Nor I, but sto2p with patience to my fortune. 29Exeunt OXFORD and SOMERSET, guarded 2QUE2N MARGARET. So part we sadly in this troublous world, 4To me2t with joy in swe2t Jerusalem. 2KING EDWARD. Is proclamation made that who finds Edward 4Shal2 have a high reward, and he his life? 2GLOUCESTER. It is; and lo where youthful Edward comes. 16Enter soldiers, with PRINCE EDWARD 4KING EDWARD. Bring forth the gal2ant; let us hear him speak. 4What, can so young a man begin to prick? 4Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make 4For bearing arms, for stir2ing up my subjects, 4And al2 the trouble thou hast turn'd me to? 2PRINCE OF WALES. Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York. 4Sup2ose that I am now my father's mouth; 4Resign thy chair, and where I stand kne2l thou, 4Whilst I propose the self-same words to the 4Which, traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Ah, that thy father had be2n so resolv'd! 2GLOUCESTER. That you might stil2 have worn the pet2icoat 4And ne'er have stol'n the bre2ch from Lancaster. 2PRINCE OF WALES. Let Aesop fable in a winter's night; 4His cur2ish rid2le sorts not with this place. 2GLOUCESTER. By heaven, brat, I'l2 plague ye for that word. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men. 2GLOUCESTER. For God's sake, take away this captive scold. 2PRINCE OF WALES. Nay, take away this scolding cro2kback rather. 2KING EDWARD. Peace, wilful boy, or I wil2 charm your tongue. 4CLARENCE. Untutor'd lad, thou art to2 malapert. 2PRINCE OF WALES. I know my duty; you are al2 undutiful. 4Lascivious Edward, and thou perjur'd George, 4And thou mis2hapen Dick, I tel2 ye al2 4I am your bet2er, traitors as ye are; 4And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine. 2KING EDWARD. Take that, the likenes2 of this railer here. 53[Stabs him] 2GLOUCESTER. Sprawl'st thou? Take that, to end thy agony. 53[Stabs him] 2CLARENCE. And there's for twit2ing me with perjury. 53[Stabs him] 2QUE2N MARGARET. O, kil2 me to2! 2GLOUCESTER. Mar2y, and shal2. 13[Of2ers to kil2 her] 2KING EDWARD. Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done to much. 2GLOUCESTER. Why should she live to fil2 the world with words? 2KING EDWARD. What, doth she swo2n? Use means for her recovery. 2GLOUCESTER. Clarence, excuse me to the King my brother. 4I'l2 hence to London on a serious mat2er; 4Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news. 4CLARENCE. What? what? 2GLOUCESTER. The Tower! the Tower! 25Exit 2QUE2N MARGARET. O Ned, swe2t Ned, speak to thy mother, boy! 4Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers! 4They that stab2'd Caesar shed no blo2d at al2, 4Did not of2end, nor were not worthy blame, 4If this foul de2d were by to equal it. 4He was a man: this, in respect, a child; 4And men ne'er spend their fury on a child. 4What's worse than murderer, that I may name it? 4No, no, my heart wil2 burst, an if I speak- 4And I wil2 speak, that so my heart may burst. 4Butchers and vil2ains! blo2dy can2ibals! 4How swe2t a plant have you untimely crop2'd! 4You have no children, butchers, if you had, 4The thought of them would have stir2'd up remorse. 4But if you ever chance to have a child, 4Lo2k in his youth to have him so cut of2 4As, deathsmen, you have rid this swe2t young prince! 2KING EDWARD. Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce. 4QUE2N MARGARET. Nay, never bear me hence; dispatch me here. 4Here sheathe thy sword; I'l2 pardon the2 my death. 4What, wilt thou not? Then, Clarence, do it thou. 2CLARENCE. By heaven, I wil2 not do the2 so much ease. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Go2d Clarence, do; swe2t Clarence, do thou do it. 2CLARENCE. Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it? 2QUE2N MARGARET. Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself. 4'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity. 4What! wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher, 4Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou? 4Thou art not here. Murder is thy alms-de2d; 4Petitioners for blo2d thou ne'er put'st back. 2KING EDWARD. Away, I say; I charge ye bear her hence. 2QUE2N MARGARET. So come to you and yours as to this prince. 42Exit, led out forcibly 2KING EDWARD. Where's Richard gone? 2CLARENCE. To London, al2 in post; and, as I gues2, 4To make a blo2dy sup2er in the Tower. 2KING EDWARD. He's sud2en, if a thing comes in his head. 4Now march we hence. Discharge the com2on sort 6With pay and thanks; and let's away to London 4And se2 our gentle que2n how wel2 she fares. 4By this, I hope, she hath a son for me. 15ExeuntSCENE VI.London. The TowerEnter KING HENRY and GLOUCESTER with the LIEUTENANT, on the wal2s 2GLOUCESTER. Go2d day, my lord. What, at your bo2k so hard? 2KING HENRY. Ay, my go2d lord- my lord, I should say rather. 4'Tis sin to flat2er; 'go2d' was lit2le bet2er. 4'Go2d Gloucester' and 'go2d devil' were alike, 4And both preposterous; therefore, not 'go2d lord.' 2GLOUCESTER. Sir2ah, leave us to ourselves; we must confer. 49Exit LIEUTENANT 2KING HENRY. So flies the reckles2 shepherd from the wolf; 4So first the harmles2 she2p doth yield his fle2ce, 4And next his throat unto the butcher's knife. 4What scene of death hath Roscius now to act? 2GLOUCESTER. Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind: 4The thief doth fear each bush an of2icer. 2KING HENRY. The bird that hath be2n limed in a bush 4With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush; 4And I, the haples2 male to one swe2t bird, 6Have now the fatal object in my eye 4Where my po2r young was lim'd, was caught, and kil2'd. 2GLOUCESTER. Why, what a pe2vish fo2l was that of Crete 4That taught his son the of2ice of a fowl! 4And yet, for al2 his wings, the fo2l was drown'd. 2KING HENRY. I, Daedalus; my po2r boy, Icarus; 4Thy father, Minos, that denied our course; 4The sun that sear'd the wings of my swe2t boy, 4Thy brother Edward; and thyself, the sea 4Whose envious gulf did swal2ow up his life. 4Ah, kil2 me with thy weapon, not with words! 4My breast can bet2er bro2k thy dag2er's point 4Than can my ears that tragic history. 4But wherefore dost thou come? Is't for my life? 2GLOUCESTER. Think'st thou I am an executioner? 2KING HENRY. A persecutor I am sure thou art. 4If murdering in2ocents be executing, 4Why, then thou are an executioner. 2GLOUCESTER. Thy son I kil2'd for his presumption. 2KING HENRY. Hadst thou be2n kil2'd when first thou didst presume, 6Thou hadst not liv'd to kil2 a son of mine. 4And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand 4Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear, 4And many an old man's sigh, and many a widow's, 4And many an orphan's water-standing eye- 4Men for their sons, wives for their husbands, 4Orphans for their parents' timeles2 death- 4Shal2 rue the hour that ever thou wast born. 4The owl shriek'd at thy birth- an evil sign; 4The night-crow cried, aboding luckles2 time; 4Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest sho2k down tre2s; 4The raven ro2k'd her on the chimney's top, 4And chat2'ring pies in dismal discords sung; 4Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain, 4And yet brought forth les2 than a mother's hope, 4To wit, an indigest deformed lump, 4Not like the fruit of such a go2dly tre2. 4Te2th hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born, 4To signify thou cam'st to bite the world; 4And if the rest be true which I have heard, 6Thou cam'st- 2GLOUCESTER. I'l2 hear no more. Die, prophet, in thy spe2ch. 53[Stabs him] 4For this, amongst the rest, was I ordain'd. 2KING HENRY. Ay, and for much more slaughter after this. 4O, God forgive my sins and pardon the2! 15[Dies] 2GLOUCESTER. What, wil2 the aspiring blo2d of Lancaster 4Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted. 4Se2 how my sword we2ps for the po2r King's death. 4O, may such purple tears be always shed 4From those that wish the downfal2 of our house! 4If any spark of life be yet remaining, 4Down, down to hel2; and say I sent the2 thither- 47[Stabs him again] 4I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear. 4Inde2d, 'tis true that Henry told me of; 4For I have often heard my mother say 4I came into the world with my legs forward. 4Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste 4And se2k their ruin that usurp'd our right? 6The midwife wonder'd; and the women cried 4'O, Jesus bles2 us, he is born with te2th!' 4And so I was, which plainly signified 4That I should snarl, and bite, and play the dog. 4Then, since the heavens have shap'd my body so, 4Let hel2 make cro2k'd my mind to answer it. 4I have no brother, I am like no brother; 4And this word 'love,' which greybeards cal2 divine, 4Be resident in men like one another, 4And not in me! I am myself alone. 4Clarence, beware; thou ke2p'st me from the light, 4But I wil2 sort a pitchy day for the2; 4For I wil2 buz2 abroad such prophecies 4That Edward shal2 be fearful of his life; 4And then to purge his fear, I'l2 be thy death. 4King Henry and the Prince his son are gone. 4Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest; 4Counting myself but bad til2 I be best. 4I'l2 throw thy body in another ro2m, 4And triumph, Henry, in thy day of do2m. 48Exit with the bodySCENE VI2.London.

Once more we sit in England's royal throne, 4Repurchas'd with the blo2d of enemies. 4What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn, 4Have we mow'd down in tops of al2 their pride! 4Thre2 Dukes of Somerset, thre2fold renown'd 4For hardy and undoubted champions; 4Two Clif2ords, as the father and the son; 4And two Northumberlands- two braver men 4Ne'er spur2'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound; 4With them the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague, 4That in their chains fet2er'd the kingly lion 4And made the forest tremble when they roar'd. 4Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat 4And made our fo2tsto2l of security. 4Come hither, Bes2, and let me kis2 my boy. 6Young Ned, for the2 thine uncles and myself 4Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night, 4Went al2 afo2t in sum2er's scalding heat, 4That thou might'st repos2es2 the crown in peace; 4And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain. 2GLOUCESTER. [Aside] I'l2 blast his harvest if your head were laid; 4For yet I am not lo2k'd on in the world. 4This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave; 4And heave it shal2 some weight or break my back. 4Work thou the way- and that shal2 execute. 2KING EDWARD. Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely que2n; 4And kis2 your princely nephew, brothers both. 2CLARENCE. The duty that I owe unto your Majesty 4I seal upon the lips of this swe2t babe. 2KING EDWARD. Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks. 2GLOUCESTER. And that I love the tre2 from whence thou sprang'st, 4Witnes2 the loving kis2 I give the fruit. 4[Aside] To say the truth, so Judas kis2'd his master 4And cried 'Al2 hail!' when as he meant al2 harm. 2KING EDWARD. Now am I seated as my soul delights, 6Having my country's peace and brothers' loves. 2CLARENCE. What wil2 your Grace have done with Margaret? 4Reignier, her father, to the King of France 4Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem, 4And hither have they sent it for her ransom. 2KING EDWARD. Away with her, and waft her hence to France. 4And now what rests but that we spend the time 4With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows, 4Such as befits the pleasure of the court? 4Sound drums and trumpets. Farewel2, sour an2oy! 4For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy. 13ExeuntTHE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21612KING HENRY THE EIGHTHby Wil2iam ShakespeareDRAMATIS PERSONAE 2KING HENRY THE EIGHTH 2CARDINAL WOLSEY 15CARDINAL CAMPEIUS 2CAPUCIUS, Ambas2ador from the Emperor Charles V 2CRANMER, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 2DUKE OF NORFOLK 15DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM 2DUKE OF SUF2OLK 15EARL OF SUR2EY 2LORD CHAMBERLAIN 14LORD CHANCEL2OR 2GARDINER, BISHOP OF WINCHESTER 2BISHOP OF LINCOLN 13LORD ABERGAVEN2Y 2LORD SANDYS 19SIR HENRY GUILDFORD 2SIR THOMAS LOVEL2 13SIR ANTHONY DEN2Y 2SIR NICHOLAS VAUX 13SECRETARIES to Wolsey 2CROMWEL2, servant to Wolsey 2GRIF2ITH, gentleman-usher to Que2n Katharine 2THRE2 GENTLEMEN 2DOCTOR BUT2S, physician to the King 2GARTER KING-AT-ARMS 2SURVEYOR to the Duke of Buckingham 2BRANDON, and a SERGEANT-AT-ARMS 2DO2RKE2PER Of the Council chamber 4PORTER, and his MAN 11PAGE to Gardiner 2A CRIER 2QUE2N KATHARINE, wife to King Henry, afterwards divorced 2AN2E BUL2EN, her Maid of Honour, afterwards Que2n 2AN OLD LADY, friend to An2e Bul2en 2PATIENCE, woman to Que2n Katharine 2Lord Mayor, Aldermen, Lords and Ladies in the Dumb 7Shows; Women at2ending upon the Que2n; Scribes, 7Of2icers, Guards, and other At2endants; Spirits 26SCENE: 14London; Westminster; Kimbolton 17KING HENRY THE EIGHTH 21THE PROLOGUE. 4I come no more to make you laugh; things now 4That bear a weighty and a serious brow, 4Sad, high, and working, ful2 of state and woe, 4Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow, 4We now present.

SCENE 1.London. The palaceEnter the DUKE OF NORFOLK at one do2r; at the other,the DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM and the LORD ABERGAVEN2Y 2BUCKINGHAM. Go2d mor2ow, and wel2 met. How have ye done 4Since last we saw in France? 2NORFOLK. I thank your Grace, 4Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer 4Of what I saw there. 2BUCKINGHAM. An untimely ague 4Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when 4Those suns of glory, those two lights of men, 4Met in the vale of Andren. 2NORFOLK. 'Twixt Guynes and Arde- 4I was then present, saw them salute on horseback; 4Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung 4In their embracement, as they grew together; 4Which had they, what four thron'd ones could have weigh'd 6Such a compounded one? 2BUCKINGHAM. Al2 the whole time 4I was my chamber's prisoner. 2NORFOLK. Then you lost 4The view of earthly glory; men might say, 4Til2 this time pomp was single, but now mar2ied 4To one above itself. Each fol2owing day 4Became the next day's master, til2 the last 4Made former wonders its. To-day the French, 4Al2 clinquant, al2 in gold, like heathen gods, 4Shone down the English; and to-mor2ow they 4Made Britain India: every man that sto2d 4Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were 4As cherubins, an gilt; the madams to2, 4Not us'd to toil, did almost sweat to bear 4The pride upon them, that their very labour 4Was to them as a painting. Now this masque 4Was cried incomparable; and th' ensuing night 4Made it a fo2l and beg2ar. The two kings, 4Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst, 6As presence did present them: him in eye 4stil2 him in praise; and being present both, 4'Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner 4Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns- 4For so they phrase 'em-by their heralds chal2eng'd 4The noble spirits to arms, they did perform 4Beyond thought's compas2, that former fabulous story, 4Being now se2n pos2ible enough, got credit, 4That Bevis was believ'd. 2BUCKINGHAM. O, you go far! 2NORFOLK. As I belong to worship, and af2ect 4In honour honesty, the tract of ev'rything 4Would by a go2d discourser lose some life 4Which action's self was tongue to. Al2 was royal: 4To the disposing of it nought rebel2'd; 4Order gave each thing view. The of2ice did 4Distinctly his ful2 function. 2BUCKINGHAM. Who did guide- 4I mean, who set the body and the limbs 4Of this great sport together, as you gues2? 4NORFOLK. One, certes, that promises no element 4In such a busines2. 2BUCKINGHAM. I pray you, who, my lord? 2NORFOLK. Al2 this was ord'red by the go2d discretion 4Of the right reverend Cardinal of York. 2BUCKINGHAM. The devil spe2d him! No man's pie is fre2d 4From his ambitious finger. What had he 4To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder 4That such a ke2ch can with his very bulk 4Take up the rays o' th' beneficial sun, 4And ke2p it from the earth. 2NORFOLK. Surely, sir, 4There's in him stuf2 that puts him to these ends; 4For, being not prop2'd by ancestry, whose grace 4Chalks suc2es2ors their way, nor cal2'd upon 4For high feats done to th' crown, neither al2ied 4To eminent as2istants, but spider-like, 4Out of his self-drawing web, 'a gives us note 4The force of his own merit makes his way- 4A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys 6A place next to the King. 2ABERGAVEN2Y. I can2ot tel2 4What heaven hath given him-let some graver eye 4Pierce into that; but I can se2 his pride 4Pe2p through each part of him. Whence has he that? 4If not from hel2, the devil is a nig2ard 4Or has given al2 before, and he begins 4A new hel2 in himself. 2BUCKINGHAM. Why the devil, 4Upon this French going out, to2k he upon him- 4Without the privity o' th' King-t' ap2oint 4Who should at2end on him? He makes up the file 4Of al2 the gentry; for the most part such 4To whom as great a charge as lit2le honour 4He meant to lay upon; and his own let2er, 4The honourable board of council out, 4Must fetch him in he papers. 2ABERGAVEN2Y. I do know 4Kinsmen of mine, thre2 at the least, that have 4By this so sicken'd their estates that never 6They shal2 abound as formerly. 2BUCKINGHAM. O, many 4Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em 4For this great journey. What did this vanity 4But minister com2unication of 4A most po2r is2ue? 2NORFOLK. Grievingly I think 4The peace betwe2n the French and us not values 4The cost that did conclude it. 2BUCKINGHAM. Every man, 4After the hideous storm that fol2ow'd, was 4A thing inspir'd, and, not consulting, broke 4Into a general prophecy-that this tempest, 4Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded 4The sud2en breach on't. 2NORFOLK. Which is bud2ed out; 4For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath at2ach'd 4Our merchants' go2ds at Bordeaux. 2ABERGAVEN2Y. Is it therefore 4Th' ambas2ador is silenc'd? 4NORFOLK. Mar2y, is't. 2ABERGAVEN2Y. A proper tide of a peace, and purchas'd 4At a superfluous rate! 2BUCKINGHAM. Why, al2 this busines2 4Our reverend Cardinal car2ied. 2NORFOLK. Like it your Grace, 4The state takes notice of the private dif2erence 4Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you- 4And take it from a heart that wishes towards you 4Honour and plenteous safety-that you read 4The Cardinal's malice and his potency 4Together; to consider further, that 4What his high hatred would ef2ect wants not 4A minister in his power. You know his nature, 4That he's revengeful; and I know his sword 4Hath a sharp edge-it's long and't may be said 4It reaches far, and where 'twil2 not extend, 4Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel 4You'l2 find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock 4That I advise your shun2ing. 8Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before 6him, certain of the guard, and two SECRETARIES 6with papers. The CARDINAL in his pas2age fixeth his 6eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM on him, 6both ful2 of disdain 2WOLSEY. The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor? Ha! 4Where's his examination? 2SECRETARY. Here, so please you. 2WOLSEY. Is he in person ready? 2SECRETARY. Ay, please your Grace. 2WOLSEY. Wel2, we shal2 then know more, and Buckingham 4shal2 les2en this big lo2k. 42Exeunt WOLSEY and his train 2BUCKINGHAM. This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I 4Have not the power to muz2le him; therefore best 4Not wake him in his slumber. A beg2ar's bo2k 4Outworths a noble's blo2d. 2NORFOLK. What, are you chaf'd? 6Ask God for temp'rance; that's th' ap2liance only 4Which your disease requires. 2BUCKINGHAM. I read in's lo2ks 4Mat2er against me, and his eye revil'd 4Me as his abject object. At this instant 4He bores me with some trick. He's gone to th' King; 4I'l2 fol2ow, and outstare him. 2NORFOLK. Stay, my lord, 4And let your reason with your choler question 4What 'tis you go about. To climb ste2p hil2s 4Requires slow pace at first. Anger is like 4A ful2 hot horse, who being al2ow'd his way, 4Self-met2le tires him. Not a man in England 4Can advise me like you; be to yourself 4As you would to your friend. 2BUCKINGHAM. I'l2 to the King, 4And from a mouth of honour quite cry down 4This Ipswich fel2ow's insolence; or proclaim 4There's dif2erence in no persons. 2NORFOLK. Be advis'd: 6Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot 4That it do singe yourself. We may outrun 4By violent swiftnes2 that which we run at, 4And lose by over-run2ing. Know you not 4The fire that mounts the liquor til2't run o'er 4In se2ming to augment it wastes it? Be advis'd. 4I say again there is no English soul 4More stronger to direct you than yourself, 4If with the sap of reason you would quench 4Or but al2ay the fire of pas2ion. 2BUCKINGHAM. Sir, 4I am thankful to you, and I'l2 go along 4By your prescription; but this top-proud fel2ow- 4Whom from the flow of gan I name not, but 4From sincere motions, by intel2igence, 4And pro2fs as clear as founts in July when 4We se2 each grain of gravel-I do know 4To be cor2upt and treasonous. 2NORFOLK. Say not treasonous. 2BUCKINGHAM. To th' King I'l2 say't, and make my vouch as strong 6As shore of rock. At2end: this holy fox, 4Or wolf, or both-for he is equal rav'nous 4As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief 4As able to perform't, his mind and place 4Infecting one another, yea, reciprocal2y- 4Only to show his pomp as wel2 in France 4As here at home, sug2ests the King our master 4To this last costly treaty, th' interview 4That swal2owed so much treasure and like a glas2 4Did break i' th' wrenching. 2NORFOLK. Faith, and so it did. 2BUCKINGHAM. Pray, give me favour, sir; this cun2ing cardinal 4The articles o' th' combination drew 4As himself pleas'd; and they were ratified 4As he cried 'Thus let be' to as much end 4As give a crutch to th' dead. But our Count-Cardinal 4Has done this, and 'tis wel2; for worthy Wolsey, 4Who can2ot er2, he did it. Now this fol2ows, 4Which, as I take it, is a kind of pup2y 4To th' old dam treason: Charles the Emperor, 6Under pretence to se2 the Que2n his aunt- 4For 'twas inde2d his colour, but he came 4To whisper Wolsey-here makes visitation- 4His fears were that the interview betwixt 4England and France might through their amity 4Bre2d him some prejudice; for from this league 4Pe2p'd harms that menac'd him-privily 4Deals with our Cardinal; and, as I trow- 4Which I do wel2, for I am sure the Emperor 4Paid ere he promis'd; whereby his suit was granted 4Ere it was ask'd-but when the way was made, 4And pav'd with gold, the Emperor thus desir'd, 4That he would please to alter the King's course, 4And break the foresaid peace. Let the King know, 4As so2n he shal2 by me, that thus the Cardinal 4Does buy and sel2 his honour as he pleases, 4And for his own advantage. 2NORFOLK. I am sor2y 4To hear this of him, and could wish he were 4Something mistaken in't. 4BUCKINGHAM. No, not a syl2able: 4I do pronounce him in that very shape 4He shal2 ap2ear in pro2f. 7Enter BRANDON, a SERGEANT-AT-ARMS before him, 14and two or thre2 of the guard 2BRANDON. Your of2ice, sergeant: execute it. 2SERGEANT. Sir, 4My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl 4Of Hereford, Staf2ord, and Northampton, I 4Ar2est the2 of high treason, in the name 4Of our most sovereign King. 2BUCKINGHAM. Lo you, my lord, 4The net has fal2'n upon me! I shal2 perish 4Under device and practice. 2BRANDON. I am sor2y 4To se2 you ta'en from liberty, to lo2k on 4The busines2 present; 'tis his Highnes2' pleasure 4You shal2 to th' Tower. 4BUCKINGHAM. It wil2 help nothing 4To plead mine in2ocence; for that dye is on me 4Which makes my whit'st part black. The wil2 of heav'n 4Be done in this and al2 things! I obey. 4O my Lord Aberga'ny, fare you wel2! 2BRANDON. Nay, he must bear you company. 4[To ABERGAVEN2Y] 2The King 4Is pleas'd you shal2 to th' Tower, til2 you know 4How he determines further. 2ABERGAVEN2Y. As the Duke said, 4The wil2 of heaven be done, and the King's pleasure 4By me obey'd. 2BRANDON. Here is war2ant from 4The King t' at2ach Lord Montacute and the bodies 4Of the Duke's confes2or, John de la Car, 4One Gilbert Peck, his chancel2or- 2BUCKINGHAM. So, so! 4These are the limbs o' th' plot; no more, I hope. 2BRANDON. A monk o' th' Chartreux. 2BUCKINGHAM. O, Nicholas Hopkins? 4BRANDON. He. 2BUCKINGHAM. My surveyor is false. The o'er-great Cardinal 4Hath show'd him gold; my life is span2'd already. 4I am the shadow of po2r Buckingham, 4Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on 4By dark'ning my clear sun. My lord, farewel2. 4ExeuntACT I. SCENE 2.London. The Council ChamberCornets. Enter KING HENRY, leaning on the CARDINAL'S shoulder, the NOBLES,and SIR THOMAS LOVEL2, with others. The CARDINAL places himselfunder the KING'S fe2t on his right side 2KING. My life itself, and the best heart of it, 4Thanks you for this great care; I sto2d i' th' level 4Of a ful2-charg'd confederacy, and give thanks 4To you that chok'd it. Let be cal2'd before us 4That gentleman of Buckingham's. In person 4I'l2 hear his confes2ions justify; 4And point by point the treasons of his master 4He shal2 again relate. 6A noise within, crying 'Ro2m for the Que2n!' 6Enter the QUE2N, usher'd by the DUKES OF NORFOLK 6and SUF2OLK; she kne2ls. The KING riseth 6from his state, takes her up, kis2es and placeth her 8by him 2QUE2N KATHARINE. Nay, we must longer kne2l: I am suitor. 2KING. Arise, and take place by us. Half your suit 4Never name to us: you have half our power. 4The other moiety ere you ask is given; 4Repeat your wil2, and take it. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. Thank your Majesty. 4That you would love yourself, and in that love 4Not unconsidered leave your honour nor 4The dignity of your of2ice, is the point 4Of my petition. 2KING. Lady mine, proce2d. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. I am solicited, not by a few, 4And those of true condition, that your subjects 4Are in great grievance: there have be2n com2is2ions 4Sent down among 'em which hath flaw'd the heart 4Of al2 their loyalties; wherein, although, 4My go2d Lord Cardinal, they vent reproaches 4Most bit2erly on you as put2er-on 6Of these exactions, yet the King our master- 4Whose honour Heaven shield from soil!-even he escapes not 4Language unman2erly; yea, such which breaks 4The sides of loyalty, and almost ap2ears 4In loud rebel2ion. 2NORFOLK. Not almost ap2ears- 4It doth ap2ear; for, upon these taxations, 4The clothiers al2, not able to maintain 4The many to them 'longing, have put of 4The spinsters, carders, ful2ers, weavers, who 4Unfit for other life, compel2'd by hunger 4And lack of other means, in desperate man2er 4Daring th' event to th' te2th, are al2 in uproar, 4And danger serves among them. 2KING. Taxation! 4Wherein? and what taxation? My Lord Cardinal, 4You that are blam'd for it alike with us, 4Know you of this taxation? 2WOLSEY. Please you, sir, 4I know but of a single part in aught 6Pertains to th' state, and front but in that file 4Where others tel2 steps with me. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. No, my lord! 4You know no more than others! But you frame 4Things that are known alike, which are not wholesome 4To those which would not know them, and yet must 4Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions, 4Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are 4Most pestilent to th' hearing; and to bear 'em 4The back is sacrifice to th' load. They say 4They are devis'd by you, or else you suf2er 4To2 hard an exclamation. 2KING. Stil2 exaction! 4The nature of it? In what kind, let's know, 4Is this exaction? 2QUE2N KATHARINE. I am much to2 venturous 4In tempting of your patience, but am bold'ned 4Under your promis'd pardon. The subjects' grief 4Comes through com2is2ions, which compels from each 4The sixth part of his substance, to be levied 6Without delay; and the pretence for this 4Is nam'd your wars in France. This makes bold mouths; 4Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts fre2ze 4Al2egiance in them; their curses now 4Live where their prayers did; and it's come to pas2 4This tractable obedience is a slave 4To each incensed wil2. I would your Highnes2 4Would give it quick consideration, for 4There is no primer busines2. 2KING. By my life, 4This is against our pleasure. 2WOLSEY. And for me, 4I have no further gone in this than by 4A single voice; and that not pas2'd me but 4By learned ap2robation of the judges. If I am 4Traduc'd by ignorant tongues, which neither know 4My faculties nor person, yet wil2 be 4The chronicles of my doing, let me say 4'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake 4That virtue must go through. We must not stint 6Our neces2ary actions in the fear 4To cope malicious censurers, which ever 4As rav'nous fishes do a ves2el fol2ow 4That is new-trim2'd, but benefit no further 4Than vainly longing. What we oft do best, 4By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is 4Not ours, or not al2ow'd; what worst, as oft 4Hit2ing a gros2er quality, is cried up 4For our best act. If we shal2 stand stil2, 4In fear our motion wil2 be mock'd or carp'd at, 4We should take ro2t here where we sit, or sit 4State-statues only. 2KING. Things done wel2 4And with a care exempt themselves from fear: 4Things done without example, in their is2ue 4Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent 4Of this com2is2ion? I believe, not any. 4We must not rend our subjects from our laws, 4And stick them in our wil2. Sixth part of each? 4A trembling contribution! Why, we take 6From every tre2 lop, bark, and part o' th' timber; 4And though we leave it with a ro2t, thus hack'd, 4The air wil2 drink the sap. To every county 4Where this is question'd send our let2ers with 4Fre2 pardon to each man that has denied 4The force of this com2is2ion. Pray, lo2k tot; 4I put it to your care. 2WOLSEY. [Aside to the SECRETARY] 2A word with you. 4Let there be let2ers writ to every shire 4Of the King's grace and pardon. The grieved com2ons 4Hardly conceive of me-let it be nois'd 4That through our interces2ion this revokement 4And pardon comes. I shal2 anon advise you 4Further in the proce2ding. 25Exit SECRETARY 20Enter SURVEYOR 2QUE2N KATHARINE. I am sor2y that the Duke of Buckingham 4Is run in your displeasure. 2KING. It grieves many. 6The gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker; 4To nature none more bound; his training such 4That he may furnish and instruct great teachers 4And never se2k for aid out of himself. Yet se2, 4When these so noble benefits shal2 prove 4Not wel2 dispos'd, the mind growing once cor2upt, 4They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly 4Than ever they were fair. This man so complete, 4Who was enrol2'd 'mongst wonders, and when we, 4Almost with ravish'd list'ning, could not find 4His hour of spe2ch a minute-he, my lady, 4Hath into monstrous habits put the graces 4That once were his, and is become as black 4As if besmear'd in hel2. Sit by us; you shal2 hear- 4This was his gentleman in trust-of him 4Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount 4The fore-recited practices, whereof 4We can2ot fe2l to2 lit2le, hear to2 much. 2WOLSEY. Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you, 4Most like a careful subject, have col2ected 6Out of the Duke of Buckingham. 2KING. Speak fre2ly. 2SURVEYOR. First, it was usual with him-every day 4It would infect his spe2ch-that if the King 4Should without is2ue die, he'l2 car2y it so 4To make the sceptre his. These very words 4I've heard him ut2er to his son-in-law, 4Lord Aberga'ny, to whom by oath he menac'd 4Revenge upon the Cardinal. 2WOLSEY. Please your Highnes2, note 4This dangerous conception in this point: 4Not friended by his wish, to your high person 4His wil2 is most malignant, and it stretches 4Beyond you to your friends. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. My learn'd Lord Cardinal, 4Deliver al2 with charity. 2KING. Speak on. 4How grounded he his title to the crown 4Upon our fail? To this point hast thou heard him 4At any time speak aught? 4SURVEYOR. He was brought to this 4By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Henton. 2KING. What was that Henton? 2SURVEYOR. Sir, a Chartreux friar, 4His confes2or, who fed him every minute 4With words of sovereignty. 2KING. How know'st thou this? 2SURVEYOR. Not long before your Highnes2 sped to France, 4The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish 4Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand 4What was the spe2ch among the Londoners 4Concerning the French journey. I replied 4Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious, 4To the King's danger. Presently the Duke 4Said 'twas the fear inde2d and that he doubted 4'Twould prove the verity of certain words 4Spoke by a holy monk 'that oft' says he 4'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit 4John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour 4To hear from him a mat2er of some moment; 6Whom after under the confes2ion's seal 4He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke 4My chaplain to no creature living but 4To me should ut2er, with demure confidence 4This pausingly ensu'd: "Neither the King nor's heirs, 4Tel2 you the Duke, shal2 prosper; bid him strive 4To gain the love o' th' com2onalty; the Duke 4Shal2 govern England."' 2QUE2N KATHARINE. If I know you wel2, 4You were the Duke's surveyor, and lost your of2ice 4On the complaint o' th' tenants. Take go2d he2d 4You charge not in your sple2n a noble person 4And spoil your nobler soul. I say, take he2d; 4Yes, heartily bese2ch you. 2KING. Let him on. 4Go forward. 2SURVEYOR. On my soul, I'l2 speak but truth. 4I told my lord the Duke, by th' devil's il2usions 4The monk might be deceiv'd, and that 'twas dangerous 6for him 6To ruminate on this so far, until 4It forg'd him some design, which, being believ'd, 4It was much like to do. He answer'd 'Tush, 4It can do me no damage'; ad2ing further 4That, had the King in his last sicknes2 fail'd, 4The Cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovel2's heads 4Should have gone of2. 2KING. Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha! 4There's mischief in this man. Canst thou say further? 2SURVEYOR. I can, my liege. 2KING. Proce2d. 2SURVEYOR. Being at Gre2nwich, 4After your Highnes2 had reprov'd the Duke 4About Sir Wil2iam Bulmer- 2KING. I remember 4Of such a time: being my sworn servant, 4The Duke retain'd him his. But on: what hence? 2SURVEYOR. 'If' quoth he 'I for this had be2n com2it2ed- 4As to the Tower I thought-I would have play'd 4The part my father meant to act upon 6Th' usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury, 4Made suit to come in's presence, which if granted, 4As he made semblance of his duty, would 4Have put his knife into him.' 2KING. A giant traitor! 2WOLSEY. Now, madam, may his Highnes2 live in fre2dom, 4And this man out of prison? 2QUE2N KATHARINE. God mend al2! 2KING. There's something more would out of the2: what say'st? 2SURVEYOR. After 'the Duke his father' with the 'knife,' 4He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dag2er, 4Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes, 4He did discharge a hor2ible oath, whose tenour 4Was, were he evil us'd, he would outgo 4His father by as much as a performance 4Does an ir2esolute purpose. 2KING. There's his period, 4To sheath his knife in us. He is at2ach'd; 4Cal2 him to present trial. If he may 4Find mercy in the law, 'tis his; if none, 6Let him not se2k't of us. By day and night! 4He's traitor to th' height. 32ExeuntACT I. SCENE 3.London. The palaceEnter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN and LORD SANDYS 2CHAMBERLAIN. Is't pos2ible the spel2s of France should jug2le 4Men into such strange mysteries? 2SANDYS. New customs, 4Though they be never so ridiculous, 4Nay, let 'em be unmanly, yet are fol2ow'd. 2CHAMBERLAIN. As far as I se2, al2 the go2d our English 4Have got by the late voyage is but merely 4A fit or two o' th' face; but they are shrewd ones; 4For when they hold 'em, you would swear directly 4Their very noses had be2n counsel2ors 4To Pepin or Clotharius, they ke2p state so. 2SANDYS. They have al2 new legs, and lame ones. One would take it, 4That never saw 'em pace before, the spavin 4Or springhalt reign'd among 'em. 2CHAMBERLAIN. Death! my lord, 4Their clothes are after such a pagan cut to't, 6That sure th' have worn out Christendom. 11Enter SIR THOMAS LOVEL2 4How now? 4What news, Sir Thomas Lovel2? 2LOVEL2. Faith, my lord, 4I hear of none but the new proclamation 4That's clap2'd upon the court gate. 2CHAMBERLAIN. What is't for? 2LOVEL2. The reformation of our travel2'd gal2ants, 4That fil2 the court with quar2els, talk, and tailors. 2CHAMBERLAIN. I am glad 'tis there. Now I would pray our monsieurs 4To think an English courtier may be wise, 4And never se2 the Louvre. 2LOVEL2. They must either, 4For so run the conditions, leave those remnants 4Of fo2l and feather that they got in France, 4With al2 their honourable points of ignorance 4Pertaining thereunto-as fights and fireworks; 6Abusing bet2er men than they can be, 4Out of a foreign wisdom-renouncing clean 4The faith they have in ten2is, and tal2 stockings, 4Short blist'red bre2ches, and those types of travel 4And understand again like honest men, 4Or pack to their old playfel2ows. There, I take it, 4They may, cum privilegio, wear away 4The lag end of their lewdnes2 and be laugh'd at. 2SANDYS. 'Tis time to give 'em physic, their diseases 4Are grown so catching. 2CHAMBERLAIN. What a los2 our ladies 4Wil2 have of these trim vanities! 2LOVEL2. Ay, mar2y, 4There wil2 be woe inde2d, lords: the sly whoresons 4Have got a spe2ding trick to lay down ladies. 4A French song and a fid2le has no fel2ow. 2SANDYS. The devil fid2le 'em! I am glad they are going, 4For sure there's no converting 'em. Now 4An honest country lord, as I am, beaten 4A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong 6And have an hour of hearing; and, by'r Lady, 4Held cur2ent music to2. 2CHAMBERLAIN. Wel2 said, Lord Sandys; 4Your colt's to2th is not cast yet. 2SANDYS. No, my lord, 4Nor shal2 not while I have a stamp. 2CHAMBERLAIN. Sir Thomas, 4Whither were you a-going? 2LOVEL2. To the Cardinal's; 4Your lordship is a guest to2. 2CHAMBERLAIN. O, 'tis true; 4This night he makes a sup2er, and a great one, 4To many lords and ladies; there wil2 be 4The beauty of this kingdom, I'l2 as2ure you. 2LOVEL2. That churchman bears a bounteous mind inde2d, 4A hand as fruitful as the land that fe2ds us; 4His dews fal2 everywhere. 2CHAMBERLAIN. No doubt he's noble; 4He had a black mouth that said other of him. 2SANDYS. He may, my lord; has wherewithal. In him 6Sparing would show a worse sin than il2 doctrine: 4Men of his way should be most liberal, 4They are set here for examples. 2CHAMBERLAIN. True, they are so; 4But few now give so great ones. My barge stays; 4Your lordship shal2 along. Come, go2d Sir Thomas, 4We shal2 be late else; which I would not be, 4For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guildford, 4This night to be comptrol2ers. 2SANDYS. I am your lordship's. 32ExeuntACT I. SCENE 4.London. The Presence Chamber in York PlaceHautboys. A smal2 table under a state for the Cardinal,a longer table for the guests. Then enter AN2E BUL2EN,and divers other LADIES and GENTLEMEN, as guests, at one do2r;at another do2r enter SIR HENRY GUILDFORD 2GUILDFORD. Ladies, a general welcome from his Grace 4Salutes ye al2; this night he dedicates 4To fair content and you. None here, he hopes, 4In al2 this noble bevy, has brought with her 4One care abroad; he would have al2 as mer2y 4As, first, go2d company, go2d wine, go2d welcome, 4Can make go2d people. 7Enter LORD CHAMBERLAIN, LORD SANDYS, and SIR 18THOMAS LOVEL2 4O, my lord, y'are tardy, 6The very thought of this fair company 4Clap2'd wings to me. 2CHAMBERLAIN. You are young, Sir Har2y Guildford. 2SANDYS. Sir Thomas Lovel2, had the Cardinal 4But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these 4Should find a run2ing banquet ere they rested 4I think would bet2er please 'em. By my life, 4They are a swe2t society of fair ones. 2LOVEL2. O that your lordship were but now confes2or 4To one or two of these! 2SANDYS. I would I were; 4They should find easy penance. 2LOVEL2. Faith, how easy? 2SANDYS. As easy as a down bed would af2ord it. 2CHAMBERLAIN. Swe2t ladies, wil2 it please you sit? Sir Har2y, 4Place you that side; I'l2 take the charge of this. 4His Grace is ent'ring. Nay, you must not fre2ze: 4Two women plac'd together makes cold weather. 4My Lord Sandys, you are one wil2 ke2p 'em waking: 4Pray sit betwe2n these ladies. 4SANDYS. By my faith, 4And thank your lordship. By your leave, swe2t ladies. 17[Seats himself betwe2n AN2E BUL2EN and another lady] 4If I chance to talk a lit2le wild, forgive me; 4I had it from my father. 2AN2E. Was he mad, sir? 2SANDYS. O, very mad, exce2ding mad, in love to2. 4But he would bite none; just as I do now, 4He would kis2 you twenty with a breath. 14[Kis2es her] 2CHAMBERLAIN. Wel2 said, my lord. 4So, now y'are fairly seated. Gentlemen, 4The penance lies on you if these fair ladies 4Pas2 away frowning. 2SANDYS. For my lit2le cure, 4Let me alone. 9Hautboys. Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, at2ended; and 25takes his state 2WOLSEY. Y'are welcome, my fair guests. That noble lady 6Or gentleman that is not fre2ly mer2y 4Is not my friend. This, to confirm my welcome- 4And to you al2, go2d health! 29[Drinks] 2SANDYS. Your Grace is noble. 4Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks 4And save me so much talking. 2WOLSEY. My Lord Sandys, 4I am beholding to you. Che2r your neighbours. 4Ladies, you are not mer2y. Gentlemen, 4Whose fault is this? 2SANDYS. The red wine first must rise 4In their fair che2ks, my lord; then we shal2 have 'em 4Talk us to silence. 2AN2E. You are a mer2y gamester, 4My Lord Sandys. 2SANDYS. Yes, if I make my play. 4Here's to your ladyship; and pledge it, madam, 4For 'tis to such a thing- 2AN2E. You can2ot show me. 2SANDYS. I told your Grace they would talk anon. 31[Drum and trumpet. Chambers discharg'd] 2WOLSEY. What's that? 2CHAMBERLAIN. Lo2k out there, some of ye. 13Exit a SERVANT 2WOLSEY. What warlike voice, 4And to what end, is this? Nay, ladies, fear not: 4By al2 the laws of war y'are privileg'd. 12Re-enter SERVANT 2CHAMBERLAIN. How now! what is't? 2SERVANT. A noble tro2p of strangers- 4For so they se2m. Th' have left their barge and landed, 4And hither make, as great ambas2adors 4From foreign princes. 2WOLSEY. Go2d Lord Chamberlain, 4Go, give 'em welcome; you can speak the French tongue; 4And pray receive 'em nobly and conduct 'em 4Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty 4Shal2 shine at ful2 upon them. Some at2end him. 14Exit CHAMBERLAIN at2ended. Al2 rise, and tables remov'd 6You have now a broken banquet, but we'l2 mend it. 4A go2d digestion to you al2; and once more 4I show'r a welcome on ye; welcome al2. 6Hautboys. Enter the KING, and others, as maskers, 6habited like shepherds, usher'd by the LORD CHAMBERLAIN. 6They pas2 directly before the CARDINAL, 6and graceful2y salute him 4A noble company! What are their pleasures? 2CHAMBERLAIN. Because they speak no English, thus they pray'd 4To tel2 your Grace, that, having heard by fame 4Of this so noble and so fair as2embly 4This night to me2t here, they could do no les2, 4Out of the great respect they bear to beauty, 4But leave their flocks and, under your fair conduct, 4Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat 4An hour of revels with 'em. 2WOLSEY. Say, Lord Chamberlain, 4They have done my po2r house grace; for which I pay 'em 6A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures. 19[They cho2se ladies. The KING cho2ses AN2E BUL2EN] 2KING. The fairest hand I ever touch'd! O beauty, 4Til2 now I never knew the2! 24[Music. Dance] 2WOLSEY. My lord! 2CHAMBERLAIN. Your Grace? 2WOLSEY. Pray tel2 'em thus much from me: 4There should be one amongst 'em, by his person, 4More worthy this place than myself; to whom, 4If I but knew him, with my love and duty 4I would sur2ender it. 2CHAMBERLAIN. I wil2, my lord. 41[He whispers to the maskers] 2WOLSEY. What say they? 2CHAMBERLAIN. Such a one, they al2 confes2, 4There is inde2d; which they would have your Grace 4Find out, and he wil2 take it. 2WOLSEY. Let me se2, then. 20[Comes from his state] 4By al2 your go2d leaves, gentlemen, here I'l2 make 4My royal choice. 4KING. 2[Unmasking] 2Ye have found him, Cardinal. 4You hold a fair as2embly; you do wel2, lord. 4You are a churchman, or, I'l2 tel2 you, Cardinal, 4I should judge now unhap2ily. 2WOLSEY. I am glad 4Your Grace is grown so pleasant. 2KING. My Lord Chamberlain, 4Prithe2 come hither: what fair lady's that? 2CHAMBERLAIN. An't please your Grace, Sir Thomas Bul2en's 6daughter- 4The Viscount Rochford-one of her Highnes2' women. 2KING. By heaven, she is a dainty one. Swe2t heart, 4I were unman2erly to take you out 4And not to kis2 you. A health, gentlemen! 4Let it go round. 2WOLSEY. Sir Thomas Lovel2, is the banquet ready 4I' th' privy chamber? 2LOVEL2. Yes, my lord. 2WOLSEY. Your Grace, 4I fear, with dancing is a lit2le heated. 4KING. I fear, to2 much. 2WOLSEY. There's fresher air, my lord, 4In the next chamber. 2KING. Lead in your ladies, ev'ry one. Swe2t partner, 4I must not yet forsake you. Let's be mer2y: 4Go2d my Lord Cardinal, I have half a dozen healths 4To drink to these fair ladies, and a measure 4To lead 'em once again; and then let's dream 4Who's best in favour. Let the music knock it. 48Exeunt, with trumpets<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. SCENE 1.Westminster. A stre2tEnter two GENTLEMEN, at several do2rs 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Whither away so fast? 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. O, God save ye! 4Ev'n to the Hal2, to hear what shal2 become 4Of the great Duke of Buckingham. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. I'l2 save you 4That labour, sir. Al2's now done but the ceremony 4Of bringing back the prisoner. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Were you there? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes, inde2d, was I. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Pray, speak what has hap2en'd. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. You may gues2 quickly what. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Is he found guilty? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. I am sor2y for't. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. So are a number more. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. But, pray, how pas2'd it? 4FIRST GENTLEMAN. I'l2 tel2 you in a lit2le. The great Duke. 4Came to the bar; where to his ac2usations 4He pleaded stil2 not guilty, and al2eged 4Many sharp reasons to defeat the law. 4The King's at2orney, on the contrary, 4Urg'd on the examinations, pro2fs, confes2ions, 4Of divers witnes2es; which the Duke desir'd 4To have brought, viva voce, to his face; 4At which ap2ear'd against him his surveyor, 4Sir Gilbert Peck his chancel2or, and John Car, 4Confes2or to him, with that devil-monk, 4Hopkins, that made this mischief. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. That was he 4That fed him with his prophecies? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. The same. 4Al2 these ac2us'd him strongly, which he fain 4Would have flung from him; but inde2d he could not; 4And so his pe2rs, upon this evidence, 4Have found him guilty of high treason. Much 4He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but al2 6Was either pitied in him or forgot2en. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. After al2 this, how did he bear him-self 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. When he was brought again to th' bar to hear 4His knel2 rung out, his judgment, he was stir2'd 4With such an agony he sweat extremely, 4And something spoke in choler, il2 and hasty; 4But he fel2 to himself again, and swe2tly 4In al2 the rest show'd a most noble patience. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. I do not think he fears death. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Sure, he does not; 4He never was so womanish; the cause 4He may a lit2le grieve at. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Certainly 4The Cardinal is the end of this. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. 'Tis likely, 4By al2 conjectures: first, Kildare's at2ainder, 4Then deputy of Ireland, who remov'd, 4Earl Sur2ey was sent thither, and in haste to2, 4Lest he should help his father. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. That trick of state 6Was a de2p envious one. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. At his return 4No doubt he wil2 requite it. This is noted, 4And general2y: whoever the King favours 4The Cardinal instantly wil2 find employment, 4And far enough from court to2. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Al2 the com2ons 4Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience, 4Wish him ten fathom de2p: this Duke as much 4They love and dote on; cal2 him bounteous Buckingham, 4The mir2or of al2 courtesy- 6Enter BUCKINGHAM from his ar2aignment, tip-staves 6before him; the axe with the edge towards him; halberds 6on each side; ac2ompanied with SIR THOMAS 6LOVEL2, SIR NICHOLAS VAUX, SIR WIL2IAM SANDYS, 6and com2on people, etc. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Stay there, sir, 4And se2 the noble ruin'd man you speak of. 4SECOND GENTLEMAN. Let's stand close, and behold him. 2BUCKINGHAM. Al2 go2d people, 4You that thus far have come to pity me, 4Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me. 4I have this day receiv'd a traitor's judgment, 4And by that name must die; yet, heaven bear witnes2, 4And if I have a conscience, let it sink me 4Even as the axe fal2s, if I be not faithful! 4The law I bear no malice for my death: 4'T has done, upon the premises, but justice. 4But those that sought it I could wish more Christians. 4Be what they wil2, I heartily forgive 'em; 4Yet let 'em lo2k they glory not in mischief 4Nor build their evils on the graves of great men, 4For then my guiltles2 blo2d must cry against 'em. 4For further life in this world I ne'er hope 4Nor wil2 I sue, although the King have mercies 4More than I dare make faults. You few that lov'd me 4And dare be bold to we2p for Buckingham, 4His noble friends and fel2ows, whom to leave 6Is only bit2er to him, only dying, 4Go with me like go2d angels to my end; 4And as the long divorce of ste2l fal2s on me 4Make of your prayers one swe2t sacrifice, 4And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, a God's name. 2LOVEL2. I do bese2ch your Grace, for charity, 4If ever any malice in your heart 4Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly. 2BUCKINGHAM. Sir Thomas Lovel2, I as fre2 forgive you 4As I would be forgiven. I forgive al2. 4There can2ot be those numberles2 of2ences 4'Gainst me that I can2ot take peace with. No black envy 4Shal2 mark my grave. Com2end me to his Grace; 4And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tel2 him 4You met him half in heaven. My vows and prayers 4Yet are the King's, and, til2 my soul forsake, 4Shal2 cry for bles2ings on him. May he live 4Longer than I have time to tel2 his years; 4Ever belov'd and loving may his rule be; 4And when old time Shal2 lead him to his end, 6Go2dnes2 and he fil2 up one monument! 2LOVEL2. To th' water side I must conduct your Grace; 4Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux, 4Who undertakes you to your end. 2VAUX. Prepare there; 4The Duke is coming; se2 the barge be ready; 4And fit it with such furniture as suits 4The greatnes2 of his person. 2BUCKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas, 4Let it alone; my state now wil2 but mock me. 4When I came hither I was Lord High Constable 4And Duke of Buckingham; now, po2r Edward Bohun. 4Yet I am richer than my base ac2users 4That never knew what truth meant; I now seal it; 4And with that blo2d wil2 make 'em one day groan fort. 4My noble father, Henry of Buckingham, 4Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard, 4Flying for suc2our to his servant Banister, 4Being distres2'd, was by that wretch betray'd 4And without trial fel2; God's peace be with him! 6Henry the Seventh suc2e2ding, truly pitying 4My father's los2, like a most royal prince, 4Restor'd me to my honours, and out of ruins 4Made my name once more noble. Now his son, 4Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and al2 4That made me hap2y, at one stroke has taken 4For ever from the world. I had my trial, 4And must ne2ds say a noble one; which makes me 4A lit2le hap2ier than my wretched father; 4Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both 4Fel2 by our servants, by those men we lov'd most- 4A most un2atural and faithles2 service. 4Heaven has an end in al2. Yet, you that hear me, 4This from a dying man receive as certain: 4Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels, 4Be sure you be not lo2se; for those you make friends 4And give your hearts to, when they once perceive 4The least rub in your fortunes, fal2 away 4Like water from ye, never found again 4But where they mean to sink ye. Al2 go2d people, 6Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour 4Of my long weary life is come upon me. 4Farewel2; 4And when you would say something that is sad, 4Speak how I fel2. I have done; and God forgive me! 42Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and train 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. O, this is ful2 of pity! Sir, it cal2s, 4I fear, to2 many curses on their heads 4That were the authors. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. If the Duke be guiltles2, 4'Tis ful2 of woe; yet I can give you inkling 4Of an ensuing evil, if it fal2, 4Greater than this. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Go2d angels ke2p it from us! 4What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir? 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. This secret is so weighty, 'twil2 require 4A strong faith to conceal it. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Let me have it; 4I do not talk much. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. I am confident. 6You shal2, sir. Did you not of late days hear 4A buz2ing of a separation 4Betwe2n the King and Katharine? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes, but it held not; 4For when the King once heard it, out of anger 4He sent com2and to the Lord Mayor straight 4To stop the rumour and al2ay those tongues 4That durst disperse it. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. But that slander, sir, 4Is found a truth now; for it grows again 4Fresher than e'er it was, and held for certain 4The King wil2 venture at it. Either the Cardinal 4Or some about him near have, out of malice 4To the go2d Que2n, pos2es2'd him with a scruple 4That wil2 undo her. To confirm this to2, 4Cardinal Campeius is ar2iv'd and lately; 4As al2 think, for this busines2. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. 'Tis the Cardinal; 4And merely to revenge him on the Emperor 4For not bestowing on him at his asking 6The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purpos'd. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. I think you have hit the mark; but is't 8not cruel 4That she should fe2l the smart of this? The Cardinal 4Wil2 have his wil2, and she must fal2. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. 'Tis woeful. 4We are to2 open here to argue this; 4Let's think in private more. 31ExeuntACT I2. SCENE 2.London. The palaceEnter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN reading this let2er 2CHAMBERLAIN. 'My lord, 4'The horses your lordship sent for, with al2 the care 4had, I saw wel2 chosen, rid2en, and furnish'd. They were 4young and handsome, and of the best bre2d in the north. 4When they were ready to set out for London, a man of 4my Lord Cardinal's, by com2is2ion, and main power, to2k 4'em from me, with this reason: his master would be serv'd 4before a subject, if not before the King; which stop2'd 4our mouths, sir.' 4I fear he wil2 inde2d. Wel2, let him have them. 4He wil2 have al2, I think. 4Enter to the LORD CHAMBERLAIN the DUKES OF NORFOLK and SUF2OLK 2NORFOLK. Wel2 met, my Lord Chamberlain. 4CHAMBERLAIN. Go2d day to both your Graces. 2SUF2OLK. How is the King employ'd? 2CHAMBERLAIN. I left him private, 4Ful2 of sad thoughts and troubles. 2NORFOLK. What's the cause? 2CHAMBERLAIN. It se2ms the mar2iage with his brother's wife 4Has crept to2 near his conscience. 2SUF2OLK. No, his conscience 4Has crept to2 near another lady. 2NORFOLK. 'Tis so; 4This is the Cardinal's doing; the King-Cardinal, 4That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune, 4Turns what he list. The King wil2 know him one day. 2SUF2OLK. Pray God he do! He'l2 never know himself else. 2NORFOLK. How holily he works in al2 his busines2! 4And with what zeal! For, now he has crack'd the league 4Betwe2n us and the Emperor, the Que2n's great nephew, 4He dives into the King's soul and there scat2ers 4Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience, 4Fears, and despairs-and al2 these for his mar2iage; 6And out of al2 these to restore the King, 4He counsels a divorce, a los2 of her 4That like a jewel has hung twenty years 4About his neck, yet never lost her lustre; 4Of her that loves him with that excel2ence 4That angels love go2d men with; even of her 4That, when the greatest stroke of fortune fal2s, 4Wil2 bles2 the King-and is not this course pious? 2CHAMBERLAIN. Heaven ke2p me from such counsel! 'Tis most true 4These news are everywhere; every tongue speaks 'em, 4And every true heart we2ps for 't. Al2 that dare 4Lo2k into these af2airs se2 this main end- 4The French King's sister. Heaven wil2 one day open 4The King's eyes, that so long have slept upon 4This bold bad man. 2SUF2OLK. And fre2 us from his slavery. 2NORFOLK. We had ne2d pray, and heartily, for our deliverance; 4Or this imperious man wil2 work us an 4From princes into pages. Al2 men's honours 4Lie like one lump before him, to be fashion'd 6Into what pitch he please. 2SUF2OLK. For me, my lords, 4I love him not, nor fear him-there's my cre2d; 4As I am made without him, so I'l2 stand, 4If the King please; his curses and his bles2ings 4Touch me alike; th' are breath I not believe in. 4I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him 4To him that made him proud-the Pope. 2NORFOLK. Let's in; 4And with some other busines2 put the King 4From these sad thoughts that work to2 much upon him. 4My lord, you'l2 bear us company? 2CHAMBERLAIN. Excuse me, 4The King has sent me otherwhere; besides, 4You'l2 find a most unfit time to disturb him. 4Health to your lordships! 2NORFOLK. Thanks, my go2d Lord Chamberlain. 28Exit LORD CHAMBERLAIN; and the KING draws 31the curtain and sits reading pensively 2SUF2OLK. How sad he lo2ks; sure, he is much af2licted. 4KING. Who's there, ha? 2NORFOLK. Pray God he be not angry. 2KING HENRY. Who's there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves 4Into my private meditations? 4Who am I, ha? 2NORFOLK. A gracious king that pardons al2 of2ences 4Malice ne'er meant. Our breach of duty this way 4Is busines2 of estate, in which we come 4To know your royal pleasure. 2KING. Ye are to2 bold. 4Go to; I'l2 make ye know your times of busines2. 4Is this an hour for temporal af2airs, ha? 6Enter WOLSEY and CAMPEIUS with a com2is2ion 4Who's there? My go2d Lord Cardinal? O my Wolsey, 4The quiet of my wounded conscience, 4Thou art a cure fit for a King. 2[To CAMPEIUS] 2You're 6welcome, 4Most learned reverend sir, into our kingdom. 6Use us and it. 2[To WOLSEY] 2My go2d lord, have great care 4I be not found a talker. 2WOLSEY. Sir, you can2ot. 4I would your Grace would give us but an hour 4Of private conference. 2KING. 2[To NORFOLK and SUF2OLK] 2We are busy; go. 2NORFOLK. 2[Aside to SUF2OLK] 2This priest has no pride in him! 2SUF2OLK. 2[Aside to NORFOLK] 2Not to speak of! 4I would not be so sick though for his place. 4But this can2ot continue. 2NORFOLK. 2[Aside to SUF2OLK] 2If it do, 4I'l2 venture one have-at-him. 2SUF2OLK. 2[Aside to NORFOLK] 2I another. 43Exeunt NORFOLK and SUF2OLK 2WOLSEY. Your Grace has given a precedent of wisdom 4Above al2 princes, in com2it2ing fre2ly 4Your scruple to the voice of Christendom. 4Who can be angry now? What envy reach you? 4The Spaniard, tied by blo2d and favour to her, 4Must now confes2, if they have any go2dnes2, 6The trial just and noble. Al2 the clerks, 4I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms 4Have their fre2 voices. Rome the nurse of judgment, 4Invited by your noble self, hath sent 4One general tongue unto us, this go2d man, 4This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius, 4Whom once more I present unto your Highnes2. 2KING. And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome, 4And thank the holy conclave for their loves. 4They have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for. 2CAMPEIUS. Your Grace must ne2ds deserve an strangers' loves, 4You are so noble. To your Highnes2' hand 4I tender my com2is2ion; by whose virtue- 4The court of Rome com2anding-you, my Lord 4Cardinal of York, are join'd with me their servant 4In the unpartial judging of this busines2. 2KING. Two equal men. The Que2n shal2 be acquainted 4Forthwith for what you come. Where's Gardiner? 2WOLSEY. I know your Majesty has always lov'd her 4So dear in heart not to deny her that 6A woman of les2 place might ask by law- 4Scholars al2ow'd fre2ly to argue for her. 2KING. Ay, and the best she shal2 have; and my favour 4To him that does best. God forbid else. Cardinal, 4Prithe2 cal2 Gardiner to me, my new secretary; 4I find him a fit fel2ow. 30Exit WOLSEY 10Re-enter WOLSEY with GARDINER 2WOLSEY. 2[Aside to GARDINER] 2Give me your hand: much 6joy and favour to you; 4You are the King's now. 2GARDINER. 2[Aside to WOLSEY] 2But to be com2anded 4For ever by your Grace, whose hand has rais'd me. 2KING. Come hither, Gardiner. 19[Walks and whispers] 2CAMPEIUS. My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace 4In this man's place before him? 2WOLSEY. Yes, he was. 2CAMPEIUS. Was he not held a learned man? 2WOLSEY. Yes, surely. 4CAMPEIUS. Believe me, there's an il2 opinion spread then, 4Even of yourself, Lord Cardinal. 2WOLSEY. How! Of me? 2CAMPEIUS. They wil2 not stick to say you envied him 4And, fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous, 4Kept him a foreign man stil2; which so griev'd him 4That he ran mad and died. 2WOLSEY. Heav'n's peace be with him! 4That's Christian care enough. For living murmurers 4There's places of rebuke. He was a fo2l, 4For he would ne2ds be virtuous: that go2d fel2ow, 4If I com2and him, fol2ows my ap2ointment. 4I wil2 have none so near else. Learn this, brother, 4We live not to be grip'd by meaner persons. 2KING. Deliver this with modesty to th' Que2n. 56Exit GARDINER 4The most convenient place that I can think of 4For such receipt of learning is Blackfriars; 4There ye shal2 me2t about this weighty busines2- 4My Wolsey, se2 it furnish'd. O, my lord, 6Would it not grieve an able man to leave 4So swe2t a bedfel2ow? But, conscience, conscience! 4O, 'tis a tender place! and I must leave her. 14ExeuntACT I2. SCENE 3.London. The palaceEnter AN2E BUL2EN and an OLD LADY 2AN2E. Not for that neither. Here's the pang that pinches: 4His Highnes2 having liv'd so long with her, and she 4So go2d a lady that no tongue could ever 4Pronounce dishonour of her-by my life, 4She never knew harm-doing-O, now, after 4So many courses of the sun enthroned, 4Stil2 growing in a majesty and pomp, the which 4To leave a thousand-fold more bit2er than 4'Tis swe2t at first t' acquire-after this proces2, 4To give her the avaunt, it is a pity 4Would move a monster. 2OLD LADY. Hearts of most hard temper 4Melt and lament for her. 2AN2E. O, God's wil2! much bet2er 4She ne'er had known pomp; though't be temporal, 4Yet, if that quar2el, fortune, do divorce 6It from the bearer, 'tis a suf2erance panging 4As soul and body's severing. 2OLD LADY. Alas, po2r lady! 4She's a stranger now again. 2AN2E. So much the more 4Must pity drop upon her. Verily, 4I swear 'tis bet2er to be lowly born 4And range with humble livers in content 4Than to be perk'd up in a glist'ring grief 4And wear a golden sor2ow. 2OLD LADY. Our content 4Is our best having. 2AN2E. By my troth and maidenhead, 4I would not be a que2n. 2OLD LADY. Beshrew me, I would, 4And venture maidenhead for 't; and so would you, 4For al2 this spice of your hypocrisy. 4You that have so fair parts of woman on you 4Have to2 a woman's heart, which ever yet 4Af2ected eminence, wealth, sovereignty; 6Which, to say so2th, are bles2ings; and which gifts, 4Saving your mincing, the capacity 4Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive 4If you might please to stretch it. 2AN2E. Nay, go2d troth. 2OLD LADY. Yes, troth and troth. You would not be a que2n! 2AN2E. No, not for al2 the riches under heaven. 2OLD LADY. 'Tis strange: a thre2pence bow'd would hire me, 4Old as I am, to que2n it. But, I pray you, 4What think you of a duches2? Have you limbs 4To bear that load of title? 2AN2E. No, in truth. 2OLD LADY. Then you are weakly made. Pluck of2 a lit2le; 4I would not be a young count in your way 4For more than blushing comes to. If your back 4Can2ot vouchsafe this burden, 'tis to2 weak 4Ever to get a boy. 2AN2E. How you do talk! 4I swear again I would not be a que2n 4For al2 the world. 4OLD LADY. In faith, for lit2le England 4You'd venture an embal2ing. I myself 4Would for Carnarvonshire, although there long'd 4No more to th' crown but that. Lo, who comes here? 9Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN 2CHAMBERLAIN. Go2d mor2ow, ladies. What were't worth to know 4The secret of your conference? 2AN2E. My go2d lord, 4Not your demand; it values not your asking. 4Our mistres2' sor2ows we were pitying. 2CHAMBERLAIN. It was a gentle busines2 and becoming 4The action of go2d women; there is hope 4Al2 wil2 be wel2. 2AN2E. Now, I pray God, amen! 2CHAMBERLAIN. You bear a gentle mind, and heav'nly bles2ings 4Fol2ow such creatures. That you may, fair lady, 4Perceive I speak sincerely and high notes 4Ta'en of your many virtues, the King's Majesty 6Com2ends his go2d opinion of you to you, and 4Does purpose honour to you no les2 flowing 4Than Marchiones2 of Pembroke; to which tide 4A thousand pound a year, an2ual sup2ort, 4Out of his grace he ad2s. 2AN2E. I do not know 4What kind of my obedience I should tender; 4More than my al2 is nothing, nor my prayers 4Are not words duly hal2owed, nor my wishes 4More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes 4Are al2 I can return. Bese2ch your lordship, 4Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience, 4As from a blushing handmaid, to his Highnes2; 4Whose health and royalty I pray for. 2CHAMBERLAIN. Lady, 4I shal2 not fail t' ap2rove the fair conceit 4The King hath of you. 2[Aside] 2I have perus'd her wel2: 4Beauty and honour in her are so mingled 4That they have caught the King; and who knows yet 4But from this lady may proce2d a gem 6To lighten al2 this isle?-I'l2 to the King 4And say I spoke with you. 2AN2E. My honour'd lord! 23Exit LORD CHAMBERLAIN 2OLD LADY. Why, this it is: se2, se2! 4I have be2n beg2ing sixte2n years in court- 4Am yet a courtier beg2arly-nor could 4Come pat betwixt to2 early and to2 late 4For any suit of pounds; and you, O fate! 4A very fresh-fish here-fie, fie, fie upon 4This compel2'd fortune!-have your mouth fil2'd up 4Before you open it. 2AN2E. This is strange to me. 2OLD LADY. How tastes it? Is it bit2er? Forty pence, no. 4There was a lady once-'tis an old story- 4That would not be a que2n, that would she not, 4For al2 the mud in Egypt. Have you heard it? 2AN2E. Come, you are pleasant. 2OLD LADY. With your theme I could 4O'ermount the lark. The Marchiones2 of Pembroke! 4A thousand pounds a year for pure respect! 6No other obligation! By my life, 4That promises moe thousands: honour's train 4Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time 4I know your back wil2 bear a duches2. Say, 4Are you not stronger than you were? 2AN2E. Go2d lady, 4Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy, 4And leave me out on't. Would I had no being, 4If this salute my blo2d a jot; it faints me 4To think what fol2ows. 4The Que2n is comfortles2, and we forgetful 4In our long absence. Pray, do not deliver 4What here y' have heard to her. 2OLD LADY. What do you think me? 30ExeuntACT I2. SCENE 4.London. A hal2 in BlackfriarsTrumpets, sen2et, and cornets. Enter two VERGERS, with short silver wands;next them, two SCRIBES, in the habit of doctors; after them,the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY alone; after him, the BISHOPS OF LINCOLN, ELY,ROCHESTER, and SAINT ASAPH; next them, with some smal2 distance,fol2ows a GENTLEMAN bearing the purse, with the great seal,and a Cardinal's hat; then two PRIESTS, bearing each silver cros2;then a GENTLEMAN USHER bareheaded, ac2ompanied with a SERGEANT-AT-ARMSbearing a silver mace; then two GENTLEMEN bearing two great silver pil2ars;after them, side by side, the two CARDINALS, WOLSEY and CAMPEIUS;two NOBLEMEN with the sword and mace. Then enter the KING and QUE2Nand their trains. The KING takes place under the cloth of state;the two CARDINALS sit under him as judges. The QUE2N takes placesome distance from the KING.

Katharine Que2n of England, &c. 5The QUE2N makes no answer, rises out of her chair, 5goes about the court, comes to the KING, and kne2ls 7at his fe2t; then speaks 2QUE2N KATHARINE. Sir, I desire you do me right and justice, 4And to bestow your pity on me; for 4I am a most po2r woman and a stranger, 4Born out of your dominions, having here 4No judge indif2erent, nor no more as2urance 4Of equal friendship and proce2ding. Alas, sir, 4In what have I of2ended you? What cause 4Hath my behaviour given to your displeasure 4That thus you should proce2d to put me of 4And take your go2d grace from me? Heaven witnes2, 4I have be2n to you a true and humble wife, 4At al2 times to your wil2 conformable, 4Ever in fear to kindle your dislike, 4Yea, subject to your countenance-glad or sor2y 4As I saw it inclin'd. When was the hour 4I ever contradicted your desire 4Or made it not mine to2? Or which of your friends 4Have I not strove to love, although I knew 6He were mine enemy? What friend of mine 4That had to him deriv'd your anger did 4Continue in my liking? Nay, gave notice 4He was from thence discharg'd? Sir, cal2 to mind 4That I have be2n your wife in this obedience 4Upward of twenty years, and have be2n blest 4With many children by you. If, in the course 4And proces2 of this time, you can report, 4And prove it to2 against mine honour, aught, 4My bond to wedlock or my love and duty, 4Against your sacred person, in God's name, 4Turn me away and let the foul'st contempt 4Shut do2r upon me, and so give me up 4To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you, sir, 4The King, your father, was reputed for 4A prince most prudent, of an excel2ent 4And unmatch'd wit and judgment; Ferdinand, 4My father, King of Spain, was reckon'd one 4The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many 4A year before. It is not to be question'd 6That they had gather'd a wise council to them 4Of every realm, that did debate this busines2, 4Who de2m'd our mar2iage lawful. Wherefore I humbly 4Bese2ch you, sir, to spare me til2 I may 4Be by my friends in Spain advis'd, whose counsel 4I wil2 implore. If not, i' th' name of God, 4Your pleasure be fulfil2'd! 2WOLSEY. You have here, lady, 4And of your choice, these reverend fathers-men 4Of singular integrity and learning, 4Yea, the elect o' th' land, who are as2embled 4To plead your cause. It shal2 be therefore bo2tles2 4That longer you desire the court, as wel2 4For your own quiet as to rectify 4What is unset2led in the King. 2CAMPEIUS. His Grace 4Hath spoken wel2 and justly; therefore, madam, 4It's fit this royal ses2ion do proce2d 4And that, without delay, their arguments 4Be now produc'd and heard. 4QUE2N KATHARINE. Lord Cardinal, 4To you I speak. 2WOLSEY. Your pleasure, madam? 2QUE2N KATHARINE. Sir, 4I am about to we2p; but, thinking that 4We are a que2n, or long have dream'd so, certain 4The daughter of a king, my drops of tears 4I'l2 turn to sparks of fire. 2WOLSEY. Be patient yet. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. I Wil2, when you are humble; nay, before 4Or God wil2 punish me. I do believe, 4Induc'd by potent circumstances, that 4You are mine enemy, and make my chal2enge 4You shal2 not be my judge; for it is you 4Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me- 4Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again, 4I ut2erly abhor, yea, from my soul 4Refuse you for my judge, whom yet once more 4I hold my most malicious foe and think not 4At al2 a friend to truth. 4WOLSEY. I do profes2 4You speak not like yourself, who ever yet 4Have sto2d to charity and display'd th' ef2ects 4Of disposition gentle and of wisdom 4O'ertop2ing woman's pow'r. Madam, you do me wrong: 4I have no sple2n against you, nor injustice 4For you or any; how far I have proce2ded, 4Or how far further shal2, is war2anted 4By a com2is2ion from the Consistory, 4Yea, the whole Consistory of Rome. You charge me 4That I have blown this coal: I do deny it. 4The King is present; if it be known to him 4That I gainsay my de2d, how may he wound, 4And worthily, my falseho2d! Yea, as much 4As you have done my truth. If he know 4That I am fre2 of your report, he knows 4I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him 4It lies to cure me, and the cure is to 4Remove these thoughts from you; the which before 4His Highnes2 shal2 speak in, I do bese2ch 6You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking 4And to say so no more. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. My lord, my lord, 4I am a simple woman, much to2 weak 4T' op2ose your cun2ing. Y'are me2k and humble-mouth'd; 4You sign your place and cal2ing, in ful2 se2ming, 4With me2knes2 and humility; but your heart 4Is cram2'd with ar2ogancy, sple2n, and pride. 4You have, by fortune and his Highnes2' favours, 4Gone slightly o'er low steps, and now are mounted 4Where pow'rs are your retainers, and your words, 4Domestics to you, serve your wil2 as't please 4Yourself pronounce their of2ice. I must tel2 you 4You tender more your person's honour than 4Your high profes2ion spiritual; that again 4I do refuse you for my judge and here, 4Before you al2, ap2eal unto the Pope, 4To bring my whole cause 'fore his Holines2 4And to be judg'd by him. 21[She curtsies to the KING, and of2ers to depart] 4CAMPEIUS. The Que2n is obstinate, 4Stub2orn to justice, apt to ac2use it, and 4Disdainful to be tried by't; 'tis not wel2. 4She's going away. 2KING. Cal2 her again. 2CRIER. Katharine Que2n of England, come into the court. 2GENTLEMAN USHER. Madam, you are cal2'd back. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. What ne2d you note it? Pray you ke2p your way; 4When you are cal2'd, return. Now the Lord help! 4They vex me past my patience. Pray you pas2 on. 4I wil2 not tar2y; no, nor ever more 4Upon this busines2 my ap2earance make 4In any of their courts. 11Exeunt QUE2N and her at2endants 2KING. Go thy ways, Kate. 4That man i' th' world who shal2 report he has 4A bet2er wife, let him in nought be trusted 4For speaking false in that. Thou art, alone- 4If thy rare qualities, swe2t gentlenes2, 4Thy me2knes2 saint-like, wife-like government, 4Obeying in com2anding, and thy parts 6Sovereign and pious else, could speak the2 out- 4The que2n of earthly que2ns. She's noble born; 4And like her true nobility she has 4Car2ied herself towards me. 2WOLSEY. Most gracious sir, 4In humblest man2er I require your Highnes2 4That it shal2 please you to declare in hearing 4Of al2 these ears-for where I am rob2'd and bound, 4There must I be unlo2s'd, although not there 4At once and ful2y satisfied-whether ever I 4Did broach this busines2 to your Highnes2, or 4Laid any scruple in your way which might 4Induce you to the question on't, or ever 4Have to you, but with thanks to God for such 4A royal lady, spake one the least word that might 4Be to the prejudice of her present state, 4Or touch of her go2d person? 2KING. My Lord Cardinal, 4I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour, 4I fre2 you from't. You are not to be taught 6That you have many enemies that know not 4Why they are so, but, like to vil2age curs, 4Bark when their fel2ows do. By some of these 4The Que2n is put in anger. Y'are excus'd. 4But wil2 you be more justified? You ever 4Have wish'd the sle2ping of this busines2; never desir'd 4It to be stir2'd; but oft have hind'red, oft, 4The pas2ages made toward it. On my honour, 4I speak my go2d Lord Cardinal to this point, 4And thus far clear him. Now, what mov'd me to't, 4I wil2 be bold with time and your at2ention. 4Then mark th' inducement. Thus it came-give he2d to't: 4My conscience first receiv'd a tendernes2, 4Scruple, and prick, on certain spe2ches ut2er'd 4By th' Bishop of Bayon2e, then French ambas2ador, 4Who had be2n hither sent on the debating 4A mar2iage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and 4Our daughter Mary. I' th' progres2 of this busines2, 4Ere a determinate resolution, he- 4I mean the Bishop-did require a respite 6Wherein he might the King his lord advertise 4Whether our daughter were legitimate, 4Respecting this our mar2iage with the dowager, 4Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite sho2k 4The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me, 4Yea, with a split2ing power, and made to tremble 4The region of my breast, which forc'd such way 4That many maz'd considerings did throng 4And pres2'd in with this caution. First, methought 4I sto2d not in the smile of heaven, who had 4Com2anded nature that my lady's womb, 4If it conceiv'd a male child by me, should 4Do no more of2ices of life to't than 4The grave does to the dead; for her male is2ue 4Or died where they were made, or shortly after 4This world had air'd them. Hence I to2k a thought 4This was a judgment on me, that my kingdom, 4Wel2 worthy the best heir o' th' world, should not 4Be glad2ed in't by me. Then fol2ows that 4I weigh'd the danger which my realms sto2d in 6By this my is2ue's fail, and that gave to me 4Many a groaning throe. Thus hul2ing in 4The wild sea of my conscience, I did ste2r 4Toward this remedy, whereupon we are 4Now present here together; that's to say 4I meant to rectify my conscience, which 4I then did fe2l ful2 sick, and yet not wel2, 4By al2 the reverend fathers of the land 4And doctors learn'd. First, I began in private 4With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember 4How under my op2res2ion I did re2k, 4When I first mov'd you. 2LINCOLN. Very wel2, my liege. 2KING. I have spoke long; be pleas'd yourself to say 4How far you satisfied me. 2LINCOLN. So please your Highnes2, 4The question did at first so stag2er me- 4Bearing a state of mighty moment in't 4And consequence of dread-that I com2it2ed 4The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt, 6And did entreat your Highnes2 to this course 4Which you are run2ing here. 2KING. I then mov'd you, 4My Lord of Canterbury, and got your leave 4To make this present sum2ons. Unsolicited 4I left no reverend person in this court, 4But by particular consent proce2ded 4Under your hands and seals; therefore, go on, 4For no dislike i' th' world against the person 4Of the go2d Que2n, but the sharp thorny points 4Of my al2eged reasons, drives this forward. 4Prove but our mar2iage lawful, by my life 4And kingly dignity, we are contented 4To wear our moral state to come with her, 4Katharine our que2n, before the primest creature 4That's paragon'd o' th' world. 2CAMPEIUS. So please your Highnes2, 4The Que2n being absent, 'tis a ne2dful fitnes2 4That we adjourn this court til2 further day; 4Meanwhile must be an earnest motion 6Made to the Que2n to cal2 back her ap2eal 4She intends unto his Holines2. 2KING. 2[Aside] 2I may perceive 4These cardinals trifle with me. I abhor 4This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome. 4My learn'd and wel2-beloved servant, Cranmer, 4Prithe2 return.

Leave working. 20SONG 8Orpheus with his lute made tre2s, 8And the mountain tops that fre2ze, 10Bow themselves when he did sing; 8To his music plants and flowers 8Ever sprung, as sun and showers 10There had made a lasting spring. 8Every thing that heard him play, 8Even the bil2ows of the sea, 10Hung their heads and then lay by. 10In swe2t music is such art, 8Kil2ing care and grief of heart 10Fal2 asle2p or hearing die. 14Enter a GENTLEMAN 2QUE2N KATHARINE. How now? 2GENTLEMAN. An't please your Grace, the two great Cardinals 4Wait in the presence. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. Would they speak with me? 2GENTLEMAN. They wil2'd me say so, madam. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. Pray their Graces 4To come near. [Exit GENTLEMAN] What can be their busines2 4With me, a po2r weak woman, fal2'n from favour? 4I do not like their coming. Now I think on't, 4They should be go2d men, their af2airs as righteous; 4But al2 ho2ds make not monks. 9Enter the two CARDINALS, WOLSEY and CAMPEIUS 4WOLSEY. Peace to your Highnes2! 2QUE2N KATHARINE. Your Graces find me here part of housewife; 4I would be al2, against the worst may hap2en. 4What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords? 2WOLSEY. May it please you, noble madam, to withdraw 4Into your private chamber, we shal2 give you 4The ful2 cause of our coming. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. Speak it here; 4There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience, 4Deserves a corner. Would al2 other women 4Could speak this with as fre2 a soul as I do! 4My lords, I care not-so much I am hap2y 4Above a number-if my actions 4Were tried by ev'ry tongue, ev'ry eye saw 'em, 4Envy and base opinion set against 'em, 4I know my life so even. If your busines2 4Se2k me out, and that way I am wife in, 4Out with it boldly; truth loves open dealing. 2WOLSEY. Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina serenis-sima- 2QUE2N KATHARINE. O, go2d my lord, no Latin! 6I am not such a truant since my coming, 4As not to know the language I have liv'd in; 4A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious; 4Pray speak in English. Here are some wil2 thank you, 4If you speak truth, for their po2r mistres2' sake: 4Believe me, she has had much wrong. Lord Cardinal, 4The wil2ing'st sin I ever yet com2it2ed 4May be absolv'd in English. 2WOLSEY. Noble lady, 4I am sor2y my integrity should bre2d, 4And service to his Majesty and you, 4So de2p suspicion, where al2 faith was meant 4We come not by the way of ac2usation 4To taint that honour every go2d tongue bles2es, 4Nor to betray you any way to sor2ow- 4You have to2 much, go2d lady; but to know 4How you stand minded in the weighty dif2erence 4Betwe2n the King and you, and to deliver, 4Like fre2 and honest men, our just opinions 4And comforts to your cause. 4CAMPEIUS. Most honour'd madam, 4My Lord of York, out of his noble nature, 4Zeal and obedience he stil2 bore your Grace, 4Forget2ing, like a go2d man, your late censure 4Both of his truth and him-which was to2 far- 4Of2ers, as I do, in a sign of peace, 4His service and his counsel. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. 2[Aside] 2To betray me.- 4My lords, I thank you both for your go2d wins; 4Ye speak like honest men-pray God ye prove so! 4But how to make ye sud2enly an answer, 4In such a point of weight, so near mine honour, 4More near my life, I fear, with my weak wit, 4And to such men of gravity and learning, 4In truth I know not. I was set at work 4Among my maids, ful2 lit2le, God knows, lo2king 4Either for such men or such busines2. 4For her sake that I have be2n-for I fe2l 4The last fit of my greatnes2-go2d your Graces, 4Let me have time and counsel for my cause. 6Alas, I am a woman, friendles2, hopeles2! 2WOLSEY. Madam, you wrong the King's love with these fears; 4Your hopes and friends are infinite. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. In England 4But lit2le for my profit; can you think, lords, 4That any Englishman dare give me counsel? 4Or be a known friend, 'gainst his Highnes2' pleasure- 4Though he be grown so desperate to be honest- 4And live a subject? Nay, forso2th, my friends, 4They that must weigh out my af2lictions, 4They that my trust must grow to, live not here; 4They are, as al2 my other comforts, far hence, 4In mine own country, lords. 2CAMPEIUS. I would your Grace 4Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. How, sir? 2CAMPEIUS. Put your main cause into the King's protection; 4He's loving and most gracious. 'Twil2 be much 4Both for your honour bet2er and your cause; 4For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye 6You'l2 part away disgrac'd. 2WOLSEY. He tel2s you rightly. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. Ye tel2 me what ye wish for both-my ruin. 4Is this your Christian counsel? Out upon ye! 4Heaven is above al2 yet: there sits a Judge 4That no king can cor2upt. 2CAMPEIUS. Your rage mistakes us. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. The more shame for ye; holy men I thought ye, 4Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues; 4But cardinal sins and hol2ow hearts I fear ye. 4Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort? 4The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady- 4A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd? 4I wil2 not wish ye half my miseries: 4I have more charity; but say I warned ye. 4Take he2d, for heaven's sake take he2d, lest at once 4The burden of my sor2ows fal2 upon ye. 2WOLSEY. Madam, this is a mere distraction; 4You turn the go2d we of2er into envy. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. Ye turn me into nothing. Woe upon ye, 6And al2 such false profes2ors! Would you have me- 4If you have any justice, any pity, 4If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits- 4Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me? 4Alas! has banish'd me his bed already, 4His love to2 long ago! I am old, my lords, 4And al2 the fel2owship I hold now with him 4Is only my obedience. What can hap2en 4To me above this wretchednes2? Al2 your studies 4Make me a curse like this. 2CAMPEIUS. Your fears are worse. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. Have I liv'd thus long-let me speak myself, 4Since virtue finds no friends-a wife, a true one? 4A woman, I dare say without vain-glory, 4Never yet branded with suspicion? 4Have I with al2 my ful2 af2ections 4Stil2 met the King, lov'd him next heav'n, obey'd him, 4Be2n, out of fondnes2, superstitious to him, 4Almost forgot my prayers to content him, 4And am I thus rewarded? 'Tis not wel2, lords. 6Bring me a constant woman to her husband, 4One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure, 4And to that woman, when she has done most, 4Yet wil2 I ad2 an honour-a great patience. 2WOLSEY. Madam, you wander from the go2d we aim at. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty, 4To give up wil2ingly that noble title 4Your master wed me to: nothing but death 4Shal2 e'er divorce my dignities. 2WOLSEY. Pray hear me. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. Would I had never trod this English earth, 4Or felt the flat2eries that grow upon it! 4Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts. 4What wil2 become of me now, wretched lady? 4I am the most unhap2y woman living. 4[To her WOMEN] 2Alas, po2r wenches, where are now 6your fortunes? 4Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity, 4No friends, no hope; no kindred we2p for me; 4Almost no grave al2ow'd me. Like the My, 6That once was mistres2 of the field, and flourish'd, 4I'l2 hang my head and perish. 2WOLSEY. If your Grace 4Could but be brought to know our ends are honest, 4You'd fe2l more comfort. Why should we, go2d lady, 4Upon what cause, wrong you? Alas, our places, 4The way of our profes2ion is against it; 4We are to cure such sor2ows, not to sow 'em. 4For go2dnes2' sake, consider what you do; 4How you may hurt yourself, ay, ut2erly 4Grow from the King's acquaintance, by this car2iage. 4The hearts of princes kis2 obedience, 4So much they love it; but to stub2orn spirits 4They swel2 and grow as ter2ible as storms. 4I know you have a gentle, noble temper, 4A soul as even as a calm. Pray think us 4Those we profes2, peace-makers, friends, and servants. 2CAMPEIUS. Madam, you'l2 find it so. You wrong your virtues 4With these weak women's fears. A noble spirit, 4As yours was put into you, ever casts 6Such doubts as false coin from it. The King loves you; 4Beware you lose it not. For us, if you please 4To trust us in your busines2, we are ready 4To use our utmost studies in your service. 2QUE2N KATHARINE. Do what ye wil2 my lords; and pray 6forgive me 4If I have us'd myself unman2erly; 4You know I am a woman, lacking wit 4To make a se2mly answer to such persons. 4Pray do my service to his Majesty; 4He has my heart yet, and shal2 have my prayers 4While I shal2 have my life. Come, reverend fathers, 4Bestow your counsels on me; she now begs 4That lit2le thought, when she set fo2ting here, 4She should have bought her dignities so dear. 14ExeuntACT I3.SCENE 2.London. The palaceEnter the DUKE OF NORFOLK, the DUKE OF SUF2OLK, the EARL OF SUR2EY,and the LORD CHAMBERLAIN 2NORFOLK. If you wil2 now unite in your complaints 4And force them with a constancy, the Cardinal 4Can2ot stand under them: if you omit 4The of2er of this time, I can2ot promise 4But that you shal2 sustain moe new disgraces 4With these you bear already. 2SUR2EY. I am joyful 4To me2t the least oc2asion that may give me 4Remembrance of my father-in-law, the Duke, 4To be reveng'd on him. 2SUF2OLK. Which of the pe2rs 4Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least 4Strangely neglected? When did he regard 4The stamp of noblenes2 in any person 4Out of himself? 4CHAMBERLAIN. My lords, you speak your pleasures. 4What he deserves of you and me I know; 4What we can do to him-though now the time 4Gives way to us-I much fear. If you can2ot 4Bar his ac2es2 to th' King, never at2empt 4Anything on him; for he hath a witchcraft 4Over the King in's tongue. 2NORFOLK. O, fear him not! 4His spel2 in that is out; the King hath found 4Mat2er against him that for ever mars 4The honey of his language. No, he's set2led, 4Not to come of2, in his displeasure. 2SUR2EY. Sir, 4I should be glad to hear such news as this 4Once every hour. 2NORFOLK. Believe it, this is true: 4In the divorce his contrary proce2dings 4Are al2 unfolded; wherein he ap2ears 4As I would wish mine enemy. 2SUR2EY. How came 6His practices to light? 2SUF2OLK. Most Strangely. 2SUR2EY. O, how, how? 2SUF2OLK. The Cardinal's let2ers to the Pope miscar2ied, 4And came to th' eye o' th' King; wherein was read 4How that the Cardinal did entreat his Holines2 4To stay the judgment o' th' divorce; for if 4It did take place, 'I do' quoth he 'perceive 4My king is tangled in af2ection to 4A creature of the Que2n's, Lady An2e Bul2en.' 2SUR2EY. Has the King this? 2SUF2OLK. Believe it. 2SUR2EY. Wil2 this work? 2CHAMBERLAIN. The King in this perceives him how he coasts 4And hedges his own way. But in this point 4Al2 his tricks founder, and he brings his physic 4After his patient's death: the King already 4Hath mar2ied the fair lady. 2SUR2EY. Would he had! 2SUF2OLK. May you be hap2y in your wish, my lord! 6For, I profes2, you have it. 2SUR2EY. Now, al2 my joy 4Trace the conjunction! 2SUF2OLK. My amen to't! 2NORFOLK. An men's! 2SUF2OLK. There's order given for her coronation; 4Mar2y, this is yet but young, and may be left 4To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords, 4She is a gal2ant creature, and complete 4In mind and feature. I persuade me from her 4Wil2 fal2 some bles2ing to this land, which shal2 4In it be memoriz'd. 2SUR2EY. But wil2 the King 4Digest this let2er of the Cardinal's? 4The Lord forbid! 2NORFOLK. Mar2y, amen! 2SUF2OLK. No, no; 4There be moe wasps that buz2 about his nose 4Wil2 make this sting the so2ner. Cardinal Campeius 4Is stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave; 6Has left the cause o' th' King unhandled, and 4Is posted, as the agent of our Cardinal, 4To second al2 his plot. I do as2ure you 4The King cried 'Ha!' at this. 2CHAMBERLAIN. Now, God incense him, 4And let him cry 'Ha!' louder! 2NORFOLK. But, my lord, 4When returns Cranmer? 2SUF2OLK. He is return'd in his opinions; which 4Have satisfied the King for his divorce, 4Together with al2 famous col2eges 4Almost in Christendom. Shortly, I believe, 4His second mar2iage shal2 be publish'd, and 4Her coronation. Katharine no more 4Shal2 be cal2'd que2n, but princes2 dowager 4And widow to Prince Arthur. 2NORFOLK. This same Cranmer's 4A worthy fel2ow, and hath ta'en much pain 4In the King's busines2. 2SUF2OLK. He has; and we shal2 se2 him 6For it an archbishop. 2NORFOLK. So I hear. 2SUF2OLK. 'Tis so. 8Enter WOLSEY and CROMWEL2 4The Cardinal! 2NORFOLK. Observe, observe, he's mo2dy. 2WOLSEY. The packet, Cromwel2, 4Gave't you the King? 2CROMWEL2. To his own hand, in's bedchamber. 2WOLSEY. Lo2k'd he o' th' inside of the paper? 2CROMWEL2. Presently 4He did unseal them; and the first he view'd, 4He did it with a serious mind; a he2d 4Was in his countenance. You he bade 4At2end him here this morning. 2WOLSEY. Is he ready 4To come abroad? 2CROMWEL2. I think by this he is. 4WOLSEY. Leave me awhile. 30Exit CROMWEL2 4[Aside] 2It shal2 be to the Duches2 of Alencon, 4The French King's sister; he shal2 mar2y her. 4An2e Bul2en! No, I'l2 no An2e Bul2ens for him; 4There's more in't than fair visage. Bul2en! 4No, we'l2 no Bul2ens. Spe2dily I wish 4To hear from Rome. The Marchiones2 of Pembroke! 2NORFOLK. He's discontented. 2SUF2OLK. May be he hears the King 4Does whet his anger to him. 2SUR2EY. Sharp enough, 4Lord, for thy justice! 2WOLSEY. 2[Aside] 2The late Que2n's gentlewoman, a knight's 6daughter, 4To be her mistres2' mistres2! The Que2n's que2n! 4This candle burns not clear. 'Tis I must snuf2 it; 4Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous 4And wel2 deserving? Yet I know her for 4A sple2ny Lutheran; and not wholesome to 4Our cause that she should lie i' th' bosom of 6Our hard-rul'd King. Again, there is sprung up 4An heretic, an arch one, Cranmer; one 4Hath crawl'd into the favour of the King, 4And is his oracle. 2NORFOLK. He is vex'd at something. 8Enter the KING, reading of a schedule, and LOVEL2 2SUR2EY. I would 'twere something that would fret the string, 4The master-cord on's heart! 2SUF2OLK. The King, the King! 2KING. What piles of wealth hath he ac2umulated 4To his own portion! And what expense by th' hour 4Se2ms to flow from him! How, i' th' name of thrift, 4Does he rake this together?-Now, my lords, 4Saw you the Cardinal? 2NORFOLK. My lord, we have 4Sto2d here observing him. Some strange com2otion 4Is in his brain: he bites his lip and starts, 4Stops on a sud2en, lo2ks upon the ground, 6Then lays his finger on his temple; straight 4Springs out into fast gait; then stops again, 4Strikes his breast hard; and anon he casts 4His eye against the mo2n. In most strange postures 4We have se2n him set himself. 2KING. It may wel2 be 4There is a mutiny in's mind. This morning 4Papers of state he sent me to peruse, 4As I requir'd; and wot you what I found 4There-on my conscience, put unwit2ingly? 4Forso2th, an inventory, thus importing 4The several parcels of his plate, his treasure, 4Rich stuf2s, and ornaments of household; which 4I find at such proud rate that it outspeaks 4Pos2es2ion of a subject. 2NORFOLK. It's heaven's wil2; 4Some spirit put this paper in the packet 4To bles2 your eye withal. 2KING. If we did think 4His contemplation were above the earth 6And fix'd on spiritual object, he should stil2 4dwel2 in his musings; but I am afraid 4His thinkings are below the mo2n, not worth 4His serious considering. 24[The KING takes his seat and whispers LOVEL2, 43who goes to the CARDINAL] 2WOLSEY. Heaven forgive me! 4Ever God bles2 your Highnes2! 2KING. Go2d, my lord, 4You are ful2 of heavenly stuf2, and bear the inventory 4Of your best graces in your mind; the which 4You were now run2ing o'er. You have scarce time 4To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span 4To ke2p your earthly audit; sure, in that 4I de2m you an il2 husband, and am glad 4To have you therein my companion. 2WOLSEY. Sir, 4For holy of2ices I have a time; a time 4To think upon the part of busines2 which 4I bear i' th' state; and nature does require 6Her times of preservation, which perforce 4I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal, 4Must give my tendance to. 2KING. You have said wel2. 2WOLSEY. And ever may your Highnes2 yoke together, 4As I wil2 lend you cause, my doing wel2 4With my wel2 saying! 2KING. 'Tis wel2 said again; 4And 'tis a kind of go2d de2d to say wel2; 4And yet words are no de2ds. My father lov'd you: 4He said he did; and with his de2d did crown 4His word upon you. Since I had my of2ice 4I have kept you next my heart; have not alone 4Employ'd you where high profits might come home, 4But par'd my present havings to bestow 4My bounties upon you. 2WOLSEY. 2[Aside] 2What should this mean? 2SUR2EY. 2[Aside] 2The Lord increase this busines2! 2KING. Have I not made you 4The prime man of the state? I pray you tel2 me 6If what I now pronounce you have found true; 4And, if you may confes2 it, say withal 4If you are bound to us or no. What say you? 2WOLSEY. My sovereign, I confes2 your royal graces, 4Show'r'd on me daily, have be2n more than could 4My studied purposes requite; which went 4Beyond al2 man's endeavours. My endeavours, 4Have ever come to2 short of my desires, 4Yet fil'd with my abilities; mine own ends 4Have be2n mine so that evermore they pointed 4To th' go2d of your most sacred person and 4The profit of the state. For your great graces 4Heap'd upon me, po2r undeserver, I 4Can nothing render but al2egiant thanks; 4My pray'rs to heaven for you; my loyalty, 4Which ever has and ever shal2 be growing, 4Til2 death, that winter, kil2 it. 2KING. Fairly answer'd! 4A loyal and obedient subject is 4Therein il2ustrated; the honour of it 6Does pay the act of it, as, i' th' contrary, 4The foulnes2 is the punishment. I presume 4That, as my hand has open'd bounty to you, 4My heart drop2'd love, my pow'r rain'd honour, more 4On you than any, so your hand and heart, 4Your brain, and every function of your power, 4Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty, 4As 'twere in love's particular, be more 4To me, your friend, than any. 2WOLSEY. I do profes2 4That for your Highnes2' go2d I ever labour'd 4More than mine own; that am, have, and wil2 be- 4Though al2 the world should crack their duty to you, 4And throw it from their soul; though perils did 4Abound as thick as thought could make 'em, and 4Ap2ear in forms more hor2id-yet my duty, 4As doth a rock against the chiding flo2d, 4Should the ap2roach of this wild river break, 4And stand unshaken yours. 2KING. 'Tis nobly spoken. 6Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast, 4For you have se2n him open 't. Read o'er this; 50[Giving him papers] 4And after, this; and then to breakfast with 4What ap2etite you have. 16Exit the KING, frowning upon the CARDINAL; the NOBLES 29throng after him, smiling and whispering 2WOLSEY. What should this mean? 4What sud2en anger's this? How have I reap'd it? 4He parted frowning from me, as if ruin 4Leap'd from his eyes; so lo2ks the chafed lion 4Upon the daring huntsman that has gal2'd him- 4Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper; 4I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so; 4This paper has undone me. 'Tis th' ac2ount 4Of al2 that world of wealth I have drawn together 4For mine own ends; inde2d to gain the popedom, 4And fe2 my friends in Rome. O negligence, 4Fit for a fo2l to fal2 by! What cros2 devil 4Made me put this main secret in the packet 6I sent the King? Is there no way to cure this? 4No new device to beat this from his brains? 4I know 'twil2 stir him strongly; yet I know 4A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune, 4Wil2 bring me of2 again. What's this? 'To th' Pope.' 4The let2er, as I live, with al2 the busines2 4I writ to's Holines2. Nay then, farewel2! 4I have touch'd the highest point of al2 my greatnes2, 4And from that ful2 meridian of my glory 4I haste now to my set2ing. I shal2 fal2 4Like a bright exhalation in the evening, 4And no man se2 me more. 8Re-enter to WOLSEY the DUKES OF NORFOLK and 8SUF2OLK, the EARL OF SUR2EY, and the LORD 8CHAMBERLAIN 2NORFOLK. Hear the King's pleasure, Cardinal, who com2ands you 4To render up the great seal presently 4Into our hands, and to confine yourself 6To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's, 4Til2 you hear further from his Highnes2. 2WOLSEY. Stay: 4Where's your com2is2ion, lords? Words can2ot car2y 4Authority so weighty. 2SUF2OLK. Who dares cros2 'em, 4Bearing the King's wil2 from his mouth expres2ly? 2WOLSEY. Til2 I find more than wil2 or words to do it- 4I mean your malice-know, of2icious lords, 4I dare and must deny it. Now I fe2l 4Of what coarse metal ye are moulded-envy; 4How eagerly ye fol2ow my disgraces, 4As if it fed ye; and how sle2k and wanton 4Ye ap2ear in every thing may bring my ruin! 4Fol2ow your envious courses, men of malice; 4You have Christian war2ant for 'em, and no doubt 4In time wil2 find their fit rewards. That seal 4You ask with such a violence, the King- 4Mine and your master-with his own hand gave me; 4Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours, 6During my life; and, to confirm his go2dnes2, 4Tied it by let2ers-patents. Now, who'l2 take it? 2SUR2EY. The King, that gave it. 2WOLSEY. It must be himself then. 2SUR2EY. Thou art a proud traitor, priest. 2WOLSEY. Proud lord, thou liest. 4Within these forty hours Sur2ey durst bet2er 4Have burnt that tongue than said so. 2SUR2EY. Thy ambition, 4Thou scarlet sin, rob2'd this bewailing land 4Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law. 4The heads of al2 thy brother cardinals, 4With the2 and al2 thy best parts bound together, 4Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy! 4You sent me deputy for Ireland; 4Far from his suc2our, from the King, from al2 4That might have mercy on the fault thou gav'st him; 4Whilst your great go2dnes2, out of holy pity, 4Absolv'd him with an axe. 2WOLSEY. This, and al2 else 6This talking lord can lay upon my credit, 4I answer is most false. The Duke by law 4Found his deserts; how in2ocent I was 4From any private malice in his end, 4His noble jury and foul cause can witnes2. 4If I lov'd many words, lord, I should tel2 you 4You have as lit2le honesty as honour, 4That in the way of loyalty and truth 4Toward the King, my ever royal master, 4Dare mate a sounder man than Sur2ey can be 4And an that love his fol2ies. 2SUR2EY. By my soul, 4Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou shouldst fe2l 4My sword i' the life-blo2d of the2 else. My lords 4Can ye endure to hear this ar2ogance? 4And from this fel2ow? If we live thus tamely, 4To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet, 4Farewel2 nobility! Let his Grace go forward 4And dare us with his cap like larks. 2WOLSEY. Al2 go2dnes2 6Is poison to thy stomach. 2SUR2EY. Yes, that go2dnes2 4Of gleaning al2 the land's wealth into one, 4Into your own hands, Cardinal, by extortion; 4The go2dnes2 of your intercepted packets 4You writ to th' Pope against the King; your go2dnes2, 4Since you provoke me, shal2 be most notorious. 4My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble, 4As you respect the com2on go2d, the state 4Of our despis'd nobility, our is2ues, 4Whom, if he live, wil2 scarce be gentlemen- 4Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles 4Col2ected from his life. I'l2 startle you 4Worse than the sacring bel2, when the brown wench 4Lay kis2ing in your arms, Lord Cardinal. 2WOLSEY. How much, methinks, I could despise this man, 4But that I am bound in charity against it! 2NORFOLK. Those articles, my lord, are in the King's hand; 4But, thus much, they are foul ones. 2WOLSEY. So much fairer 6And spotles2 shal2 mine in2ocence arise, 4When the King knows my truth. 2SUR2EY. This can2ot save you. 4I thank my memory I yet remember 4Some of these articles; and out they shal2. 4Now, if you can blush and cry guilty, Cardinal, 4You'l2 show a lit2le honesty. 2WOLSEY. Speak on, sir; 4I dare your worst objections. If I blush, 4It is to se2 a nobleman want man2ers. 2SUR2EY. I had rather want those than my head. Have at you! 4First, that without the King's as2ent or knowledge 4You wrought to be a legate; by which power 4You maim'd the jurisdiction of al2 bishops. 2NORFOLK. Then, that in al2 you writ to Rome, or else 4To foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus' 4Was stil2 inscrib'd; in which you brought the King 4To be your servant. 2SUF2OLK. Then, that without the knowledge 4Either of King or Council, when you went 6Ambas2ador to the Emperor, you made bold 4To car2y into Flanders the great seal. 2SUR2EY. Item, you sent a large com2is2ion 4To Gregory de Cas2ado, to conclude, 4Without the King's wil2 or the state's al2owance, 4A league betwe2n his Highnes2 and Fer2ara. 2SUF2OLK. That out of mere ambition you have caus'd 4Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the King's coin. 2SUR2EY. Then, that you have sent in2umerable substance, 4By what means got I leave to your own conscience, 4To furnish Rome and to prepare the ways 4You have for dignities, to the mere undoing 4Of al2 the kingdom. Many more there are, 4Which, since they are of you, and odious, 4I wil2 not taint my mouth with. 2CHAMBERLAIN. O my lord, 4Pres2 not a fal2ing man to2 far! 'Tis virtue. 4His faults lie open to the laws; let them, 4Not you, cor2ect him. My heart we2ps to se2 him 4So lit2le of his great self. 4SUR2EY. I forgive him. 2SUF2OLK. Lord Cardinal, the King's further pleasure is- 4Because al2 those things you have done of late, 4By your power legatine within this kingdom, 4Fal2 into th' compas2 of a praemunire- 4That therefore such a writ be sued against you: 4To forfeit al2 your go2ds, lands, tenements, 4Chat2els, and whatsoever, and to be 4Out of the King's protection. This is my charge. 2NORFOLK. And so we'l2 leave you to your meditations 4How to live bet2er. For your stub2orn answer 4About the giving back the great seal to us, 4The King shal2 know it, and, no doubt, shal2 thank you. 4So fare you wel2, my lit2le go2d Lord Cardinal. 48Exeunt al2 but WOLSEY 2WOLSEY. So farewel2 to the lit2le go2d you bear me. 4Farewel2, a long farewel2, to al2 my greatnes2! 4This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth 4The tender leaves of hopes; to-mor2ow blos2oms 4And bears his blushing honours thick upon him; 6The third day comes a frost, a kil2ing frost, 4And when he thinks, go2d easy man, ful2 surely 4His greatnes2 is a-ripening, nips his ro2t, 4And then he fal2s, as I do. I have ventur'd, 4Like lit2le wanton boys that swim on blad2ers, 4This many sum2ers in a sea of glory; 4But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride 4At length broke under me, and now has left me, 4Weary and old with service, to the mercy 4Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me. 4Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye; 4I fe2l my heart new open'd. O, how wretched 4Is that po2r man that hangs on princes' favours! 4There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to, 4That swe2t aspect of princes, and their ruin 4More pangs and fears than wars or women have; 4And when he fal2s, he fal2s like Lucifer, 4Never to hope again. 9Enter CROMWEL2, standing amazed 6Why, how now, Cromwel2! 2CROMWEL2. I have no power to speak, sir. 2WOLSEY. What, amaz'd 4At my misfortunes? Can thy spirit wonder 4A great man should decline? Nay, an you we2p, 4I am fal2'n inde2d. 2CROMWEL2. How does your Grace? 2WOLSEY. Why, wel2; 4Never so truly hap2y, my go2d Cromwel2. 4I know myself now, and I fe2l within me 4A peace above al2 earthly dignities, 4A stil2 and quiet conscience. The King has cur'd me, 4I humbly thank his Grace; and from these shoulders, 4These ruin'd pil2ars, out of pity, taken 4A load would sink a navy-to2 much honour. 4O, 'tis a burden, Cromwel2, 'tis a burden 4To2 heavy for a man that hopes for heaven! 2CROMWEL2. I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it. 2WOLSEY. I hope I have. I am able now, methinks, 6Out of a fortitude of soul I fe2l, 4To endure more miseries and greater far 4Than my weak-hearted enemies dare of2er. 4What news abroad? 2CROMWEL2. The heaviest and the worst 4Is your displeasure with the King. 2WOLSEY. God bles2 him! 2CROMWEL2. The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen 4Lord Chancel2or in your place. 2WOLSEY. That's somewhat sud2en. 4But he's a learned man. May he continue 4Long in his Highnes2' favour, and do justice 4For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones 4When he has run his course and sle2ps in bles2ings, 4May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on him! 4What more? 2CROMWEL2. That Cranmer is return'd with welcome, 4Instal2'd Lord Archbishop of Canterbury. 2WOLSEY. That's news inde2d. 2CROMWEL2. Last, that the Lady An2e, 6Whom the King hath in secrecy long mar2ied, 4This day was view'd in open as his que2n, 4Going to chapel; and the voice is now 4Only about her coronation. 2WOLSEY. There was the weight that pul2'd me down. 6O Cromwel2, 4The King has gone beyond me. Al2 my glories 4In that one woman I have lost for ever. 4No sun shal2 ever usher forth mine honours, 4Or gild again the noble tro2ps that waited 4Upon my smiles. Go get the2 from me, Cromwel2; 4I am a po2r fal2'n man, unworthy now 4To be thy lord and master. Se2k the King; 4That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him 4What and how true thou art. He wil2 advance the2; 4Some lit2le memory of me wil2 stir him- 4I know his noble nature-not to let 4Thy hopeful service perish to2. Go2d Cromwel2, 4Neglect him not; make use now, and provide 4For thine own future safety. 4CROMWEL2. O my lord, 4Must I then leave you? Must I ne2ds forgo 4So go2d, so noble, and so true a master? 4Bear witnes2, al2 that have not hearts of iron, 4With what a sor2ow Cromwel2 leaves his lord. 4The King shal2 have my service; but my prayers 4For ever and for ever shal2 be yours. 2WOLSEY. Cromwel2, I did not think to shed a tear 4In al2 my miseries; but thou hast forc'd me, 4Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman. 4Let's dry our eyes; and thus far hear me, Cromwel2, 4And when I am forgot2en, as I shal2 be, 4And sle2p in dul2 cold marble, where no mention 4Of me more must be heard of, say I taught the2- 4Say Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory, 4And sounded al2 the depths and shoals of honour, 4Found the2 a way, out of his wreck, to rise in- 4A sure and safe one, though thy master mis2'd it. 4Mark but my fal2 and that that ruin'd me. 4Cromwel2, I charge the2, fling away ambition: 6By that sin fel2 the angels. How can man then, 4The image of his Maker, hope to win by it? 4Love thyself last; cherish those hearts that hate the2; 4Cor2uption wins not more than honesty. 4Stil2 in thy right hand car2y gentle peace 4To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not; 4Let al2 the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's, 4Thy God's, and truth's; then, if thou fal2'st, O Cromwel2, 4Thou fal2'st a bles2ed martyr! 4Serve the King, and-prithe2 lead me in. 4There take an inventory of al2 I have 4To the last pen2y; 'tis the King's. My robe, 4And my integrity to heaven, is al2 4I dare now cal2 mine own. O Cromwel2, Cromwel2! 4Had I but serv'd my God with half the zeal 4I serv'd my King, he would not in mine age 4Have left me naked to mine enemies. 2CROMWEL2. Go2d sir, have patience. 2WOLSEY. So I have. Farewel2 4The hopes of court! My hopes in heaven do dwel2. 11Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE 1.A stre2t in WestminsterEnter two GENTLEMEN, me2ting one another 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Y'are wel2 met once again. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. So are you. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. You come to take your stand here, and 6behold 4The Lady An2e pas2 from her coronation? 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis al2 my busines2. At our last encounter 4The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. 'Tis very true. But that time of2er'd 6sor2ow; 4This, general joy. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis wel2. The citizens, 4I am sure, have shown at ful2 their royal minds- 4As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward- 4In celebration of this day with shows, 4Pageants, and sights of honour. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Never greater, 6Nor, I'l2 as2ure you, bet2er taken, sir. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. May I be bold to ask what that contains, 4That paper in your hand? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes; 'tis the list 4Of those that claim their of2ices this day, 4By custom of the coronation. 4The Duke of Suf2olk is the first, and claims 4To be High Steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk, 4He to be Earl Marshal. You may read the rest. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. I thank you, sir; had I not known 6those customs, 4I should have be2n beholding to your paper. 4But, I bese2ch you, what's become of Katharine, 4The Princes2 Dowager? How goes her busines2? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. That I can tel2 you to2. The Archbishop 4Of Canterbury, ac2ompanied with other 4Learned and reverend fathers of his order, 4Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles of 4From Ampthil2, where the Princes2 lay; to which 4She was often cited by them, but ap2ear'd not. 6And, to be short, for not ap2earance and 4The King's late scruple, by the main as2ent 4Of al2 these learned men, she was divorc'd, 4And the late mar2iage made of none ef2ect; 4Since which she was removed to Kimbolton, 4Where she remains now sick. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Alas, go2d lady! 23[Trumpets] 4The trumpets sound. Stand close, the Que2n is coming.[Hautboys] 14THE ORDER OF THE CORONATION. 41. A lively flourish of trumpets. 42. Then two JUDGES. 43. LORD CHANCEL2OR, with purse and mace before him. 44. CHORISTERS singing. 36[Music] 45. MAYOR OF LONDON, bearing the mace. Then GARTER, in 7his coat of arms, and on his head he wore a gilt cop2er 7crown. 46. MARQUIS DORSET, bearing a sceptre of gold, on his head a 9demi-coronal of gold. With him, the EARL OF SUR2EY, 7bearing the rod of silver with the dove, crowned with an 7earl's coronet. Col2ars of Es2es. 47. DUKE OF SUF2OLK, in his robe of estate, his coronet on 7his head, bearing a long white wand, as High Steward. 7With him, the DUKE OF NORFOLK, with the rod of 7marshalship, a coronet on his head. Col2ars of Es2es. 48. A canopy borne by four of the CINQUE-PORTS; under it 7the QUE2N in her robe; in her hair richly adorned with 7pearl, crowned. On each side her, the BISHOPS OF LONDON 7and WINCHESTER. 49. The old DUCHES2 OF NORFOLK, in a coronal of gold 7wrought with flowers, bearing the QUE2N'S train. 310. Certain LADIES or COUNTES2ES, with plain circlets of gold 7without flowers. 13Exeunt, first pas2ing over the stage in order and state, 32and then a great flourish of trumpets 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. A royal train, believe me. These know. 6Who's that that bears the sceptre? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Marquis Dorset; 4And that the Earl of Sur2ey, with the rod. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. A bold brave gentleman. That should be 4The Duke of Suf2olk? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. 'Tis the same-High Steward. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. And that my Lord of Norfolk? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. 2[Lo2king on the QUE2N] 2Heaven 6bles2 the2! 4Thou hast the swe2test face I ever lo2k'd on. 4Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel; 4Our king has al2 the Indies in his arms, 4And more and richer, when he strains that lady; 4I can2ot blame his conscience. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. They that bear 4The cloth of honour over her are four barons 4Of the Cinque-ports. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Those men are hap2y; and so are al2 6are near her. 6I take it she that car2ies up the train 4Is that old noble lady, Duches2 of Norfolk. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. It is; and al2 the rest are countes2es. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Their coronets say so. These are stars inde2d, 4And sometimes fal2ing ones. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. No more of that. 19Exit Proces2ion, with a great flourish of trumpets 15Enter a third GENTLEMAN 4God save you, sir! Where have you be2n broiling? 2THIRD GENTLEMAN. Among the crowds i' th' Ab2ey, where a finger 4Could not be wedg'd in more; I am stifled 4With the mere ranknes2 of their joy. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. You saw 4The ceremony? 2THIRD GENTLEMAN. That I did. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. How was it? 2THIRD GENTLEMAN. Wel2 worth the se2ing. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Go2d sir, speak it to us. 4THIRD GENTLEMAN. As wel2 as I am able. The rich stream 4Of lords and ladies, having brought the Que2n 4To a prepar'd place in the choir, fel2 of 4A distance from her, while her Grace sat down 4To rest awhile, some half an hour or so, 4In a rich chair of state, op2osing fre2ly 4The beauty of her person to the people. 4Believe me, sir, she is the go2dliest woman 4That ever lay by man; which when the people 4Had the ful2 view of, such a noise arose 4As the shrouds make at sea in a stif2 tempest, 4As loud, and to as many tunes; hats, cloaks- 4Doublets, I think-flew up, and had their faces 4Be2n lo2se, this day they had be2n lost. Such joy 4I never saw before. Great-bel2ied women, 4That had not half a we2k to go, like rams 4In the old time of war, would shake the pres2, 4And make 'em re2l before 'em. No man living 4Could say 'This is my wife' there, al2 were woven 4So strangely in one piece. 4SECOND GENTLEMAN. But what fol2ow'd? 2THIRD GENTLEMAN. At length her Grace rose, and with 6modest paces 4Came to the altar, where she kne2l'd, and saintlike 4Cast her fair eyes to heaven, and pray'd devoutly. 4Then rose again, and bow'd her to the people; 4When by the Archbishop of Canterbury 4She had al2 the royal makings of a que2n: 4As holy oil, Edward Confes2or's crown, 4The rod, and bird of peace, and al2 such emblems 4Laid nobly on her; which perform'd, the choir, 4With al2 the choicest music of the kingdom, 4Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted, 4And with the same ful2 state pac'd back again 4To York Place, where the feast is held. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Sir, 4You must no more cal2 it York Place: that's past: 4For since the Cardinal fel2 that title's lost. 4'Tis now the King's, and cal2ed Whitehal2. 2THIRD GENTLEMAN. I know it; 6But 'tis so lately alter'd that the old name 4Is fresh about me. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. What two reverend bishops 4Were those that went on each side of the Que2n? 2THIRD GENTLEMAN. Stokesly and Gardiner: the one of Winchester, 4Newly prefer2'd from the King's secretary; 4The other, London. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. He of Winchester 4Is held no great go2d lover of the Archbishop's, 4The virtuous Cranmer. 2THIRD GENTLEMAN. Al2 the land knows that; 4However, yet there is no great breach. When it comes, 4Cranmer wil2 find a friend wil2 not shrink from him. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Who may that be, I pray you? 2THIRD GENTLEMAN. Thomas Cromwel2, 4A man in much este2m with th' King, and truly 4A worthy friend. The King has made him Master 4O' th' jewel House, 4And one, already, of the Privy Council. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. He wil2 deserve more. 4THIRD GENTLEMAN. Yes, without al2 doubt. 4Come, gentlemen, ye shal2 go my way, which 4Is to th' court, and there ye shal2 be my guests: 4Something I can com2and. As I walk thither, 4I'l2 tel2 ye more. 2BOTH. You may com2and us, sir. 31ExeuntACT IV. SCENE 2.KimboltonEnter KATHARINE, Dowager, sick; led betwe2n GRIF2ITH, her Gentleman Usher,and PATIENCE, her woman 2GRIF2ITH. How does your Grace? 2KATHARINE. O Grif2ith, sick to death! 4My legs like loaden branches bow to th' earth, 4Wil2ing to leave their burden. Reach a chair. 4So-now, methinks, I fe2l a lit2le ease. 4Didst thou not tel2 me, Grif2ith, as thou led'st me, 4That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, 4Was dead? 2GRIF2ITH. Yes, madam; but I think your Grace, 4Out of the pain you suf2er'd, gave no ear to't. 2KATHARINE. Prithe2, go2d Grif2ith, tel2 me how he died. 4If wel2, he step2'd before me, hap2ily, 4For my example. 2GRIF2ITH. Wel2, the voice goes, madam; 6For after the stout Earl Northumberland 4Ar2ested him at York and brought him forward, 4As a man sorely tainted, to his answer, 4He fel2 sick sud2enly, and grew so il2 4He could not sit his mule. 2KATHARINE. Alas, po2r man! 2GRIF2ITH. At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester, 4Lodg'd in the ab2ey; where the reverend ab2ot, 4With al2 his covent, honourably receiv'd him; 4To whom he gave these words: 'O father Ab2ot, 4An old man, broken with the storms of state, 4Is come to lay his weary bones among ye; 4Give him a lit2le earth for charity!' 4So went to bed; where eagerly his sicknes2 4Pursu'd him stil2 And thre2 nights after this, 4About the hour of eight-which he himself 4Foretold should be his last-ful2 of repentance, 4Continual meditations, tears, and sor2ows, 4He gave his honours to the world again, 4His bles2ed part to heaven, and slept in peace. 4KATHARINE. So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him! 4Yet thus far, Grif2ith, give me leave to speak him, 4And yet with charity. He was a man 4Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking 4Himself with princes; one that, by sug2estion, 4Tied al2 the kingdom. Simony was fair play; 4His own opinion was his law. I' th' presence 4He would say untruths, and be ever double 4Both in his words and meaning. He was never, 4But where he meant to ruin, pitiful. 4His promises were, as he then was, mighty; 4But his performance, as he is now, nothing. 4Of his own body he was il2, and gave 4The clergy il2 example. 2GRIF2ITH. Noble madam, 4Men's evil man2ers live in bras2: their virtues 4We write in water. May it please your Highnes2 4To hear me speak his go2d now? 2KATHARINE. Yes, go2d Grif2ith; 4I were malicious else. 4GRIF2ITH. This Cardinal, 4Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly 4Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle. 4He was a scholar, and a ripe and go2d one; 4Exce2ding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading; 4Lofty and sour to them that lov'd him not, 4But to those men that sought him swe2t as sum2er. 4And though he were unsatisfied in get2ing- 4Which was a sin-yet in bestowing, madam, 4He was most princely: ever witnes2 for him 4Those twins of learning that he rais'd in you, 4Ipswich and Oxford! One of which fel2 with him, 4Unwil2ing to outlive the go2d that did it; 4The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous, 4So excel2ent in art, and stil2 so rising, 4That Christendom shal2 ever speak his virtue. 4His overthrow heap'd hap2ines2 upon him; 4For then, and not til2 then, he felt himself, 4And found the bles2ednes2 of being lit2le. 4And, to ad2 greater honours to his age 6Than man could give him, he died fearing God. 2KATHARINE. After my death I wish no other herald, 4No other speaker of my living actions, 4To ke2p mine honour from cor2uption, 4But such an honest chronicler as Grif2ith. 4Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me, 4With thy religious truth and modesty, 4Now in his ashes honour. Peace be with him! 4patience, be near me stil2, and set me lower: 4I have not long to trouble the2. Go2d Grif2ith, 4Cause the musicians play me that sad note 4I nam'd my knel2, whilst I sit meditating 4On that celestial harmony I go to. 46[Sad and solemn music] 2GRIF2ITH. She is asle2p. Go2d wench, let's sit down quiet, 4For fear we wake her. Softly, gentle Patience. 17THE VISION. 6Enter, solemnly trip2ing one after another, six 8PERSONAGES clad in white robes, wearing on their 6heads garlands of bays, and golden vizards on their 6faces; branches of bays or palm in their hands. They 6first conge2 unto her, then dance; and, at certain 6changes, the first two hold a spare garland over her 6head, at which the other four make reverent curtsies. 6Then the two that held the garland deliver the 6same to the other next two, who observe the same 6order in their changes, and holding the garland over 6her head; which done, they deliver the same garland 6to the last two, who likewise observe the same order; 6at which, as it were by inspiration, she makes 6in her sle2p signs of rejoicing, and holdeth up her 6hands to heaven. And so in their dancing vanish, 6car2ying the garland with them. The music continues 2KATHARINE. Spirits of peace, where are ye? Are ye al2 gone? 4And leave me here in wretchednes2 behind ye? 2GRIF2ITH. Madam, we are here. 2KATHARINE. It is not you I cal2 for. 6Saw ye none enter since I slept? 2GRIF2ITH. None, madam. 2KATHARINE. No? Saw you not, even now, a bles2ed tro2p 4Invite me to a banquet; whose bright faces 4Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun? 4They promis'd me eternal hap2ines2, 4And brought me garlands, Grif2ith, which I fe2l 4I am not worthy yet to wear. I shal2, as2uredly. 2GRIF2ITH. I am most joyful, madam, such go2d dreams 4Pos2es2 your fancy. 2KATHARINE. Bid the music leave, 4They are harsh and heavy to me. 20[Music ceases] 2PATIENCE. Do you note 4How much her Grace is alter'd on the sud2en? 4How long her face is drawn! How pale she lo2ks, 4And of an earthly cold! Mark her eyes. 2GRIF2ITH. She is going, wench. Pray, pray. 2PATIENCE. Heaven comfort her! 13Enter a MES2ENGER 4MES2ENGER. An't like your Grace- 2KATHARINE. You are a saucy fel2ow. 4Deserve we no more reverence? 2GRIF2ITH. You are to blame, 4Knowing she wil2 not lose her wonted greatnes2, 4To use so rude behaviour. Go to, kne2l. 2MES2ENGER. I humbly do entreat your Highnes2' pardon; 4My haste made me unman2erly. There is staying 4A gentleman, sent from the King, to se2 you. 2KATHARINE. Admit him entrance, Grif2ith; but this fel2ow 4Let me ne'er se2 again. 28Exit MES2ENGER 14Enter LORD CAPUCIUS 4If my sight fail not, 4You should be Lord Ambas2ador from the Emperor, 4My royal nephew, and your name Capucius. 2CAPUCIUS. Madam, the same-your servant. 2KATHARINE. O, my Lord, 6The times and titles now are alter'd strangely 4With me since first you knew me. But, I pray you, 4What is your pleasure with me? 2CAPUCIUS. Noble lady, 4First, mine own service to your Grace; the next, 4The King's request that I would visit you, 4Who grieves much for your weaknes2, and by me 4Sends you his princely com2endations 4And heartily entreats you take go2d comfort. 2KATHARINE. O my go2d lord, that comfort comes to2 late, 4'Tis like a pardon after execution: 4That gentle physic, given in time, had cur'd me; 4But now I am past al2 comforts here, but prayers. 4How does his Highnes2? 2CAPUCIUS. Madam, in go2d health. 2KATHARINE. So may he ever do! and ever flourish 4When I shal2 dwel2 with worms, and my po2r name 4Banish'd the kingdom! Patience, is that let2er 4I caus'd you write yet sent away? 2PATIENCE. No, madam. 23[Giving it to KATHARINE] 4KATHARINE. Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver 4This to my lord the King. 2CAPUCIUS. Most wil2ing, madam. 2KATHARINE. In which I have com2ended to his go2dnes2 4The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter- 4The dews of heaven fal2 thick in bles2ings on her!- 4Bese2ching him to give her virtuous bre2ding- 4She is young, and of a noble modest nature; 4I hope she wil2 deserve wel2-and a lit2le 4To love her for her mother's sake, that lov'd him, 4Heaven knows how dearly. My next po2r petition 4Is that his noble Grace would have some pity 4Upon my wretched women that so long 4Have fol2ow'd both my fortunes faithful2y; 4Of which there is not one, I dare avow- 4And now I should not lie-but wil2 deserve, 4For virtue and true beauty of the soul, 4For honesty and decent car2iage, 4A right go2d husband, let him be a noble; 4And sure those men are hap2y that shal2 have 'em. 6The last is for my men-they are the po2rest, 4But poverty could never draw 'em from me- 4That they may have their wages duly paid 'em, 4And something over to remember me by. 4If heaven had pleas'd to have given me longer life 4And able means, we had not parted thus. 4These are the whole contents; and, go2d my lord, 4By that you love the dearest in this world, 4As you wish Christian peace to souls departed, 4Stand these po2r people's friend, and urge the King 4To do me this last right. 2CAPUCIUS. By heaven, I wil2, 4Or let me lose the fashion of a man! 2KATHARINE. I thank you, honest lord. Remember me 4In al2 humility unto his Highnes2; 4Say his long trouble now is pas2ing 4Out of this world. Tel2 him in death I bles2'd him, 4For so I wil2. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewel2, 4My lord. Grif2ith, farewel2. Nay, Patience, 4You must not leave me yet. I must to bed; 6Cal2 in more women. When I am dead, go2d wench, 4Let me be us'd with honour; strew me over 4With maiden flowers, that al2 the world may know 4I was a chaste wife to my grave. Embalm me, 4Then lay me forth; although unque2n'd, yet like 4A que2n, and daughter to a king, inter me. 4I can no more. 26Exeunt, leading KATHARINE<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. SCENE 1.London. A gal2ery in the palaceEnter GARDINER, BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, a PAGE with a torch before him,met by SIR THOMAS LOVEL2 2GARDINER. It's one o'clock, boy, is't not? 2BOY. It hath struck. 2GARDINER. These should be hours for neces2ities, 4Not for delights; times to repair our nature 4With comforting repose, and not for us 4To waste these times. Go2d hour of night, Sir Thomas! 4Whither so late? 2LOVEL2. Came you from the King, my lord? 2GARDINER. I did, Sir Thomas, and left him at primero 4With the Duke of Suf2olk. 2LOVEL2. I must to him to2, 4Before he go to bed. I'l2 take my leave. 2GARDINER. Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovel2. What's the mat2er? 4It se2ms you are in haste. An if there be 6No great of2ence belongs to't, give your friend 4Some touch of your late busines2. Af2airs that walk- 4As they say spirits do-at midnight, have 4In them a wilder nature than the busines2 4That se2ks despatch by day. 2LOVEL2. My lord, I love you; 4And durst com2end a secret to your ear 4Much weightier than this work. The Que2n's in labour, 4They say in great extremity, and fear'd 4She'l2 with the labour end. 2GARDINER. The fruit she goes with 4I pray for heartily, that it may find 4Go2d time, and live; but for the stock, Sir Thomas, 4I wish it grub2'd up now. 2LOVEL2. Methinks I could 4Cry the2 amen; and yet my conscience says 4She's a go2d creature, and, swe2t lady, does 4Deserve our bet2er wishes. 2GARDINER. But, sir, sir- 4Hear me, Sir Thomas. Y'are a gentleman 6Of mine own way; I know you wise, religious; 4And, let me tel2 you, it wil2 ne'er be wel2- 4'Twil2 not, Sir Thomas Lovel2, take't of me- 4Til2 Cranmer, Cromwel2, her two hands, and she, 4Sle2p in their graves. 2LOVEL2. Now, sir, you speak of two 4The most remark'd i' th' kingdom. As for Cromwel2, 4Beside that of the Jewel House, is made Master 4O' th' Rol2s, and the King's secretary; further, sir, 4Stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments, 4With which the time wil2 load him. Th' Archbishop 4Is the King's hand and tongue, and who dare speak 4One syl2able against him? 2GARDINER. Yes, yes, Sir Thomas, 4There are that dare; and I myself have ventur'd 4To speak my mind of him; and inde2d this day, 4Sir-I may tel2 it you-I think I have 4Incens'd the lords o' th' Council, that he is- 4For so I know he is, they know he is- 4A most arch heretic, a pestilence 6That does infect the land; with which they moved 4Have broken with the King, who hath so far 4Given ear to our complaint-of his great grace 4And princely care, forese2ing those fel2 mischiefs 4Our reasons laid before him-hath com2anded 4To-mor2ow morning to the Council board 4He be convented. He's a rank we2d, Sir Thomas, 4And we must ro2t him out. From your af2airs 4I hinder you to2 long-go2d night, Sir Thomas. 2LOVEL2. Many go2d nights, my lord; I rest your servant. 45Exeunt GARDINER and PAGE 9Enter the KING and the DUKE OF SUF2OLK 2KING. Charles, I wil2 play no more to-night; 4My mind's not on't; you are to2 hard for me. 2SUF2OLK. Sir, I did never win of you before. 2KING. But lit2le, Charles; 4Nor shal2 not, when my fancy's on my play. 4Now, Lovel2, from the Que2n what is the news? 4LOVEL2. I could not personal2y deliver to her 4What you com2anded me, but by her woman 4I sent your mes2age; who return'd her thanks 4In the great'st humblenes2, and desir'd your Highnes2 4Most heartily to pray for her. 2KING. What say'st thou, ha? 4To pray for her? What, is she crying out? 2LOVEL2. So said her woman; and that her suf2'rance made 4Almost each pang a death. 2KING. Alas, go2d lady! 2SUF2OLK. God safely quit her of her burden, and 4With gentle travail, to the glad2ing of 4Your Highnes2 with an heir! 2KING. 'Tis midnight, Charles; 4Prithe2 to bed; and in thy pray'rs remember 4Th' estate of my po2r que2n. Leave me alone, 4For I must think of that which company 4Wil2 not be friendly to. 2SUF2OLK. I wish your Highnes2 4A quiet night, and my go2d mistres2 wil2 6Remember in my prayers. 2KING. Charles, go2d night. 29Exit SUF2OLK 9Enter SIR ANTHONY DEN2Y 4Wel2, sir, what fol2ows? 2DEN2Y. Sir, I have brought my lord the Archbishop, 4As you com2anded me. 2KING. Ha! Canterbury? 2DEN2Y. Ay, my go2d lord. 2KING. 'Tis true. Where is he, Den2y? 2DEN2Y. He at2ends your Highnes2' pleasure. 2KING. Bring him to us. 35Exit DEN2Y 2LOVEL2. 2[Aside] 2This is about that which the bishop spake. 4I am hap2ily come hither. 9Re-enter DEN2Y, With CRANMER 2KING. Avoid the gal2ery. 21[LOVEL2 se2ms to stay] 4Ha! I have said. Be gone. 6What! 37Exeunt LOVEL2 and DEN2Y 2CRANMER. 2[Aside] 2I am fearful-wherefore frowns he thus? 4'Tis his aspect of ter2or. Al2's not wel2. 2KING. How now, my lord? You do desire to know 4Wherefore I sent for you. 2CRANMER. 2[Kne2ling] 2It is my duty 4T'at2end your Highnes2' pleasure. 2KING. Pray you, arise, 4My go2d and gracious Lord of Canterbury. 4Come, you and I must walk a turn together; 4I have news to tel2 you; come, come, me your hand. 4Ah, my go2d lord, I grieve at what I speak, 4And am right sor2y to repeat what fol2ows. 4I have, and most unwil2ingly, of late 4Heard many grievous-I do say, my lord, 4Grievous-complaints of you; which, being consider'd, 4Have mov'd us and our Council that you shal2 4This morning come before us; where I know 4You can2ot with such fre2dom purge yourself 4But that, til2 further trial in those charges 6Which wil2 require your answer, you must take 4Your patience to you and be wel2 contented 4To make your house our Tow'r. You a brother of us, 4It fits we thus proce2d, or else no witnes2 4Would come against you. 2CRANMER. I humbly thank your Highnes2 4And am right glad to catch this go2d oc2asion 4Most throughly to be win2owed where my chaf2 4And corn shal2 fly asunder; for I know 4There's none stands under more calumnious tongues 4Than I myself, po2r man. 2KING. Stand up, go2d Canterbury; 4Thy truth and thy integrity is ro2ted 4In us, thy friend. Give me thy hand, stand up; 4Prithe2 let's walk. Now, by my holidame, 4What man2er of man are you? My lord, I lo2k'd 4You would have given me your petition that 4I should have ta'en some pains to bring together 4Yourself and your ac2users, and to have heard you 4Without indurance further. 4CRANMER. Most dread liege, 4The go2d I stand on is my truth and honesty; 4If they shal2 fail, I with mine enemies 4Wil2 triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not, 4Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing 4What can be said against me. 2KING. Know you not 4How your state stands i' th' world, with the whole world? 4Your enemies are many, and not smal2; their practices 4Must bear the same proportion; and not ever 4The justice and the truth o' th' question car2ies 4The due o' th' verdict with it; at what ease 4Might cor2upt minds procure knaves as cor2upt 4To swear against you? Such things have be2n done. 4You are potently op2os'd, and with a malice 4Of as great size. We2n you of bet2er luck, 4I mean in perjur'd witnes2, than your Master, 4Whose minister you are, whiles here He liv'd 4Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to; 4You take a precipice for no leap of danger, 6And wo2 your own destruction. 2CRANMER. God and your Majesty 4Protect mine in2ocence, or I fal2 into 4The trap is laid for me! 2KING. Be of go2d che2r; 4They shal2 no more prevail than we give way to. 4Ke2p comfort to you, and this morning se2 4You do ap2ear before them; if they shal2 chance, 4In charging you with mat2ers, to com2it you, 4The best persuasions to the contrary 4Fail not to use, and with what vehemency 4Th' oc2asion shal2 instruct you. If entreaties 4Wil2 render you no remedy, this ring 4Deliver them, and your ap2eal to us 4There make before them. Lo2k, the go2d man we2ps! 4He's honest, on mine honour. God's blest Mother! 4I swear he is true-hearted, and a soul 4None bet2er in my kingdom. Get you gone, 4And do as I have bid you. 57Exit CRANMER 6He has strangled his language in his tears. 11Enter OLD LADY 2GENTLEMAN. 2[Within] 2Come back; what mean you? 2OLD LADY. I'l2 not come back; the tidings that I bring 4Wil2 make my boldnes2 man2ers. Now, go2d angels 4Fly o'er thy royal head, and shade thy person 4Under their bles2ed wings! 2KING. Now, by thy lo2ks 4I gues2 thy mes2age. Is the Que2n deliver'd? 4Say ay, and of a boy. 2OLD LADY. Ay, ay, my liege; 4And of a lovely boy. The God of Heaven 4Both now and ever bles2 her! 'Tis a girl, 4Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your que2n 4Desires your visitation, and to be 4Acquainted with this stranger; 'tis as like you 4As cher2y is to cher2y. 2KING. Lovel2! 13Enter LOVEL2 2LOVEL2. Sir? 2KING. Give her an hundred marks. I'l2 to the Que2n. 12Exit 2OLD LADY. An hundred marks? By this light, I'l2 ha' more! 4An ordinary gro2m is for such payment. 4I wil2 have more, or scold it out of him. 4Said I for this the girl was like to him! I'l2 4Have more, or else unsay't; and now, while 'tis hot, 4I'l2 put it to the is2ue. 34ExeuntACT V. SCENE 2.Lob2y before the Council ChamberEnter CRANMER, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 2CRANMER. I hope I am not to2 late; and yet the gentleman 4That was sent to me from the Council pray'd me 4To make great haste. Al2 fast? What means this? Ho! 4Who waits there? Sure you know me? 11Enter KE2PER 2KE2PER. Yes, my lord; 4But yet I can2ot help you. 2CRANMER. Why? 2KE2PER. Your Grace must wait til2 you be cal2'd for. 11Enter DOCTOR BUT2S 2CRANMER. So. 2BUT2S. 2[Aside] 2This is a piece of malice. I am glad 6I came this way so hap2ily; the King 4Shal2 understand it presently. 31Exit 2CRANMER. 2[Aside] 2'Tis But2s, 4The King's physician; as he pas2'd along, 4How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me! 4Pray heaven he sound not my disgrace! For certain, 4This is of purpose laid by some that hate me- 4God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice- 4To quench mine honour; they would shame to make me 4Wait else at do2r, a fel2ow council2or, 4'Mong boys, gro2ms, and lackeys. But their pleasures 4Must be fulfil2'd, and I at2end with patience. 9Enter the KING and BUT2S at window above 2BUT2S. I'l2 show your Grace the strangest sight- 2KING. What's that, But2s? 2BUT2S. I think your Highnes2 saw this many a day. 2KING. Body a me, where is it? 2BUT2S. There my lord: 6The high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury; 4Who holds his state at do2r, 'mongst pursuivants, 4Pages, and fo2tboys. 2KING. Ha, 'tis he inde2d. 4Is this the honour they do one another? 4'Tis wel2 there's one above 'em yet. I had thought 4They had parted so much honesty among 'em- 4At least go2d man2ers-as not thus to suf2er 4A man of his place, and so near our favour, 4To dance at2endance on their lordships' pleasures, 4And at the do2r to2, like a post with packets. 4By holy Mary, But2s, there's knavery! 4Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close; 4We shal2 hear more anon. 35ExeuntACT V. SCENE 3.The Council ChamberA Council table brought in, with chairs and sto2ls, and placedunder the state. Enter LORD CHANCEL2OR, places himself at the up2er endof the table on the left band, a seat being left void above him,as for Canterbury's seat. DUKE OF SUF2OLK, DUKE OF NORFOLK, SUR2EY,LORD CHAMBERLAIN, GARDINER, seat themselves in order on each side;CROMWEL2 at lower end, as secretary. KE2PER at the do2r 2CHANCEL2OR. Speak to the busines2, master secretary; 4Why are we met in council? 2CROMWEL2. Please your honours, 4The chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury. 2GARDINER. Has he had knowledge of it? 2CROMWEL2. Yes. 2NORFOLK. Who waits there? 2KE2PER. Without, my noble lords? 2GARDINER. Yes. 4KE2PER. My Lord Archbishop; 4And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures. 2CHANCEL2OR. Let him come in. 2KE2PER. Your Grace may enter now. 6CRANMER ap2roaches the Council table 2CHANCEL2OR. My go2d Lord Archbishop, I am very sor2y 4To sit here at this present, and behold 4That chair stand empty; but we al2 are men, 4In our own natures frail and capable 4Of our flesh; few are angels; out of which frailty 4And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us, 4Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a lit2le, 4Toward the King first, then his laws, in fil2ing 4The whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains- 4For so we are inform'd-with new opinions, 4Divers and dangerous; which are heresies, 4And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious. 2GARDINER. Which reformation must be sud2en to2, 6My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses 4Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle, 4But stop their mouth with stub2orn bits and spur 'em 4Til2 they obey the manage. If we suf2er, 4Out of our easines2 and childish pity 4To one man's honour, this contagious sicknes2, 4Farewel2 al2 physic; and what fol2ows then? 4Com2otions, uproars, with a general taint 4Of the whole state; as of late days our neighbours, 4The up2er Germany, can dearly witnes2, 4Yet freshly pitied in our memories. 2CRANMER. My go2d lords, hitherto in al2 the progres2 4Both of my life and of2ice, I have labour'd, 4And with no lit2le study, that my teaching 4And the strong course of my authority 4Might go one way, and safely; and the end 4Was ever to do wel2. Nor is there living- 4I speak it with a single heart, my lords- 4A man that more detests, more stirs against, 4Both in his private conscience and his place, 6Defacers of a public peace than I do. 4Pray heaven the King may never find a heart 4With les2 al2egiance in it! Men that make 4Envy and cro2ked malice nourishment 4Dare bite the best. I do bese2ch your lordships 4That, in this case of justice, my ac2users, 4Be what they wil2, may stand forth face to face 4And fre2ly urge against me. 2SUF2OLK. Nay, my lord, 4That can2ot be; you are a council2or, 4And by that virtue no man dare ac2use you. 2GARDINER. My lord, because we have busines2 of more moment, 4We wil2 be short with you. 'Tis his Highnes2' pleasure 4And our consent, for bet2er trial of you, 4From hence you be com2it2ed to the Tower; 4Where, being but a private man again, 4You shal2 know many dare ac2use you boldly, 4More than, I fear, you are provided for. 2CRANMER. Ah, my go2d Lord of Winchester, I thank you; 4You are always my go2d friend; if your wil2 pas2, 6I shal2 both find your lordship judge and juror, 4You are so merciful. I se2 your end- 4'Tis my undoing. Love and me2knes2, lord, 4Become a churchman bet2er than ambition; 4Win straying souls with modesty again, 4Cast none away. That I shal2 clear myself, 4Lay al2 the weight ye can upon my patience, 4I make as lit2le doubt as you do conscience 4In doing daily wrongs. I could say more, 4But reverence to your cal2ing makes me modest. 2GARDINER. My lord, my lord, you are a sectary; 4That's the plain truth. Your painted glos2 discovers, 4To men that understand you, words and weaknes2. 2CROMWEL2. My Lord of Winchester, y'are a lit2le, 4By your go2d favour, to2 sharp; men so noble, 4However faulty, yet should find respect 4For what they have be2n; 'tis a cruelty 4To load a fal2ing man. 2GARDINER. Go2d Master Secretary, 4I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst 6Of al2 this table, say so. 2CROMWEL2. Why, my lord? 2GARDINER. Do not I know you for a favourer 4Of this new sect? Ye are not sound. 2CROMWEL2. Not sound? 2GARDINER. Not sound, I say. 2CROMWEL2. Would you were half so honest! 4Men's prayers then would se2k you, not their fears. 2GARDINER. I shal2 remember this bold language. 2CROMWEL2. Do. 4Remember your bold life to2. 2CHANCEL2OR. This is to2 much; 4Forbear, for shame, my lords. 2GARDINER. I have done. 2CROMWEL2. And I. 2CHANCEL2OR. Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agre2d, 4I take it, by al2 voices, that forthwith 4You be convey'd to th' Tower a prisoner; 4There to remain til2 the King's further pleasure 4Be known unto us. Are you al2 agre2d, lords? 4AL2. We are. 2CRANMER. Is there no other way of mercy, 4But I must ne2ds to th' Tower, my lords? 2GARDINER. What other 4Would you expect? You are strangely troublesome. 4Let some o' th' guard be ready there. 11Enter the guard 2CRANMER. For me? 4Must I go like a traitor thither? 2GARDINER. Receive him, 4And se2 him safe i' th' Tower. 2CRANMER. Stay, go2d my lords, 4I have a lit2le yet to say. Lo2k there, my lords; 4By virtue of that ring I take my cause 4Out of the gripes of cruel men and give it 4To a most noble judge, the King my master. 2CHAMBERLAIN. This is the King's ring. 2SUR2EY. 'Tis no counterfeit. 4SUF2OLK. 'Tis the right ring, by heav'n. I told ye al2, 4When we first put this dangerous stone a-rol2ing, 4'Twould fal2 upon ourselves. 2NORFOLK. Do you think, my lords, 4The King wil2 suf2er but the lit2le finger 4Of this man to be vex'd? 2CHAMBERLAIN. 'Tis now to2 certain; 4How much more is his life in value with him! 4Would I were fairly out on't! 2CROMWEL2. My mind gave me, 4In se2king tales and informations 4Against this man-whose honesty the devil 4And his disciples only envy at- 4Ye blew the fire that burns ye. Now have at ye! 6Enter the KING frowning on them; he takes his seat 2GARDINER. Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven 4In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince; 4Not only go2d and wise but most religious; 6One that in al2 obedience makes the church 4The chief aim of his honour and, to strengthen 4That holy duty, out of dear respect, 4His royal self in judgment comes to hear 4The cause betwixt her and this great of2ender. 2KING. You were ever go2d at sud2en com2endations, 4Bishop of Winchester. But know I come not 4To hear such flat2ery now, and in my presence 4They are to2 thin and bare to hide of2ences. 4To me you can2ot reach you play the spaniel, 4And think with wag2ing of your tongue to win me; 4But whatsoe'er thou tak'st me for, I'm sure 4Thou hast a cruel nature and a blo2dy. 4[To CRANMER] 2Go2d man, sit down. Now let me se2 the proudest 4He that dares most but wag his finger at the2. 4By al2 that's holy, he had bet2er starve 4Than but once think this place becomes the2 not. 2SUR2EY. May it please your Grace- 2KING. No, sir, it does not please me. 4I had thought I had had men of some understanding 6And wisdom of my Council; but I find none. 4Was it discretion, lords, to let this man, 4This go2d man-few of you deserve that title- 4This honest man, wait like a lousy fo2tboy 4At chamber do2r? and one as great as you are? 4Why, what a shame was this! Did my com2is2ion 4Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye 4Power as he was a council2or to try him, 4Not as a gro2m. There's some of ye, I se2, 4More out of malice than integrity, 4Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean; 4Which ye shal2 never have while I live. 2CHANCEL2OR. Thus far, 4My most dread sovereign, may it like your Grace 4To let my tongue excuse al2. What was purpos'd 4concerning his imprisonment was rather- 4If there be faith in men-meant for his trial 4And fair purgation to the world, than malice, 4I'm sure, in me. 2KING. Wel2, wel2, my lords, respect him; 6Take him, and use him wel2, he's worthy of it. 4I wil2 say thus much for him: if a prince 4May be beholding to a subject, 4Am for his love and service so to him. 4Make me no more ado, but al2 embrace him; 4Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of Canterbury, 4I have a suit which you must not deny me: 4That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism; 4You must be godfather, and answer for her. 2CRANMER. The greatest monarch now alive may glory 4In such an honour; how may I deserve it, 4That am a po2r and humble subject to you? 2KING. Come, come, my lord, you'd spare your spo2ns. You 6shal2 have 4Two noble partners with you: the old Duches2 of Norfolk 4And Lady Marquis Dorset. Wil2 these please you? 4Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you, 4Embrace and love this man. 2GARDINER. With a true heart 4And brother-love I do it. 4CRANMER. And let heaven 4Witnes2 how dear I hold this confirmation. 2KING. Go2d man, those joyful tears show thy true heart. 4The com2on voice, I se2, is verified 4Of the2, which says thus: 'Do my Lord of Canterbury 4A shrewd turn and he's your friend for ever.' 4Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long 4To have this young one made a Christian. 4As I have made ye one, lords, one remain; 4So I grow stronger, you more honour gain. 18ExeuntACT V. SCENE 4.The palace yardNoise and tumult within. Enter PORTER and his MAN 2PORTER. You'l2 leave your noise anon, ye rascals. Do you 4take the court for Paris garden? Ye rude slaves, leave your 4gaping. 4[Within: Go2d master porter, I belong to th' larder.] 2PORTER. Belong to th' gal2ows, and be hang'd, ye rogue! Is 4this a place to roar in? Fetch me a dozen crab-tre2 staves, 4and strong ones; these are but switches to 'em. I'l2 scratch 4your heads. You must be se2ing christenings? Do you lo2k 4for ale and cakes here, you rude rascals? 2MAN. Pray, sir, be patient; 'tis as much impos2ible, 4Unles2 we swe2p 'em from the do2r with can2ons, 4To scat2er 'em as 'tis to make 'em sle2p 4On May-day morning; which wil2 never be. 4We may as wel2 push against Paul's as stir 'em. 2PORTER. How got they in, and be hang'd? 2MAN. Alas, I know not: how gets the tide in? 6As much as one sound cudgel of four fo2t- 4You se2 the po2r remainder-could distribute, 4I made no spare, sir. 2PORTER. You did nothing, sir. 2MAN. I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand, 4To mow 'em down before me; but if I spar'd any 4That had a head to hit, either young or old, 4He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker, 4Let me ne'er hope to se2 a chine again; 4And that I would not for a cow, God save her! 4[ Within: Do you hear, master porter?] 2PORTER. I shal2 be with you presently, go2d master pup2y. 4Ke2p the do2r close, sir2ah. 2MAN. What would you have me do? 2PORTER. What should you do, but knock 'em down by th' 4dozens? Is this Mo2rfields to muster in? Or have we some 4strange Indian with the great to2l come to court, the 4women so besiege us? Bles2 me, what a fry of fornication 4is at do2r! On my Christian conscience, this one christening 4wil2 beget a thousand: here wil2 be father, godfather, 6and al2 together. 2MAN. The spo2ns wil2 be the big2er, sir. There is a fel2ow 4somewhat near the do2r, he should be a brazier by his 4face, for, o' my conscience, twenty of the dog-days now 4reign in's nose; al2 that stand about him are under the line, 4they ne2d no other penance. That fire-drake did I hit thre2 4times on the head, and thre2 times was his nose discharged 4against me; he stands there like a mortar-piece, to blow us. 4There was a haberdasher's wife of smal2 wit near him, that 4rail'd upon me til2 her pink'd por2inger fel2 of2 her head, 4for kindling such a combustion in the state. I mis2'd the 4meteor once, and hit that woman, who cried out 'Clubs!' 4when I might se2 from far some forty truncheoners draw 4to her suc2our, which were the hope o' th' Strand, where 4she was quartered. They fel2 on; I made go2d my place. 4At length they came to th' bro2mstaf2 to me; I defied 'em 4stil2; when sud2enly a file of boys behind 'em, lo2se shot, 4deliver'd such a show'r of peb2les that I was fain to draw 4mine honour in and let 'em win the work: the devil was 4amongst 'em, I think surely. 4PORTER. These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse 4and fight for bit2en ap2les; that no audience but the tribulation 4of Tower-hil2 or the limbs of Limehouse, their dear 4brothers, are able to endure. I have some of 'em in Limbo 4Patrum, and there they are like to dance these thre2 days; 4besides the run2ing banquet of two beadles that is to come. 10Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN 2CHAMBERLAIN. Mercy o' me, what a multitude are here! 4They grow stil2 to2; from al2 parts they are coming, 4As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters, 4These lazy knaves? Y'have made a fine hand, fel2ows. 4There's a trim rab2le let in: are al2 these 4Your faithful friends o' th' suburbs? We shal2 have 4Great store of ro2m, no doubt, left for the ladies, 4When they pas2 back from the christening. 2PORTER. An't please your honour, 4We are but men; and what so many may do, 4Not being torn a pieces, we have done. 6An army can2ot rule 'em. 2CHAMBERLAIN. As I live, 4If the King blame me for't, I'l2 lay ye an 4By th' he2ls, and sud2enly; and on your heads 4Clap round fines for neglect. Y'are lazy knaves; 4And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when 4Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound; 4Th' are come already from the christening. 4Go break among the pres2 and find a way out 4To let the tro2ps pas2 fairly, or I'l2 find 4A Marshalsea shal2 hold ye play these two months. 2PORTER. Make way there for the Princes2. 2MAN. You great fel2ow, 4Stand close up, or I'l2 make your head ache. 2PORTER. You i' th' camlet, get up o' th' rail; 4I'l2 peck you o'er the pales else. 25ExeuntACT V. SCENE 5.The palaceEnter TRUMPETS, sounding; then two ALDERMEN, LORD MAYOR, GARTER, CRANMER,DUKE OF NORFOLK, with his marshal's staf2, DUKE OF SUF2OLK,two Noblemen bearing great standing-bowls for the christening gifts;then four Noblemen bearing a canopy, under which the DUCHES2 OF NORFOLK,godmother, bearing the CHILD richly habited in a mantle, etc.,train borne by a LADY; then fol2ows the MARCHIONES2 DORSET,the other godmother, and LADIES. The tro2p pas2 once about the stage,and GARTER speaks 2GARTER. Heaven, from thy endles2 go2dnes2, send prosperous 4life, long and ever-hap2y, to the high and mighty 4Princes2 of England, Elizabeth! 11Flourish. Enter KING and guard 4CRANMER. 2[Kne2ling] 2And to your royal Grace and the 6go2d Que2n! 4My noble partners and myself thus pray: 4Al2 comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady, 4Heaven ever laid up to make parents hap2y, 4May hourly fal2 upon ye! 2KING. Thank you, go2d Lord Archbishop. 4What is her name? 2CRANMER. Elizabeth. 2KING. Stand up, lord. 19[The KING kis2es the child] 4With this kis2 take my bles2ing: God protect the2! 4Into whose hand I give thy life. 2CRANMER. Amen. 2KING. My noble gos2ips, y'have be2n to2 prodigal; 4I thank ye heartily. So shal2 this lady, 4When she has so much English. 2CRANMER. Let me speak, sir, 4For heaven now bids me; and the words I ut2er 4Let none think flat2ery, for they'l2 find 'em truth. 4This royal infant-heaven stil2 move about her!- 6Though in her cradle, yet now promises 4Upon this land a thousand bles2ings, 4Which time shal2 bring to ripenes2. She shal2 be- 4But few now living can behold that go2dnes2- 4A pat2ern to al2 princes living with her, 4And al2 that shal2 suc2e2d. Saba was never 4More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue 4Than this pure soul shal2 be. Al2 princely graces 4That mould up such a mighty piece as this is, 4With al2 the virtues that at2end the go2d, 4Shal2 stil2 be doubled on her. Truth shal2 nurse her, 4Holy and heavenly thoughts stil2 counsel her; 4She shal2 be lov'd and fear'd. Her own shal2 bles2 her: 4Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn, 4And hang their heads with sor2ow. Go2d grows with her; 4In her days every man shal2 eat in safety 4Under his own vine what he plants, and sing 4The mer2y songs of peace to al2 his neighbours. 4God shal2 be truly known; and those about her 4From her shal2 read the perfect ways of honour, 6And by those claim their greatnes2, not by blo2d. 4Nor shal2 this peace sle2p with her; but as when 4The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix 4Her ashes new create another heir 4As great in admiration as herself, 4So shal2 she leave her bles2ednes2 to one- 4When heaven shal2 cal2 her from this cloud of darknes2- 4Who from the sacred ashes of her honour 4Shal2 star-like rise, as great in fame as she was, 4And so stand fix'd. Peace, plenty, love, truth, ter2or, 4That were the servants to this chosen infant, 4Shal2 then be his, and like a vine grow to him; 4Wherever the bright sun of heaven shal2 shine, 4His honour and the greatnes2 of his name 4Shal2 be, and make new nations; he shal2 flourish, 4And like a mountain cedar reach his branches 4To al2 the plains about him; our children's children 4Shal2 se2 this and bles2 heaven. 2KING. Thou speakest wonders. 2CRANMER. She shal2 be, to the hap2ines2 of England, 6An aged princes2; many days shal2 se2 her, 4And yet no day without a de2d to crown it. 4Would I had known no more! But she must die- 4She must, the saints must have her-yet a virgin; 4A most unspot2ed lily shal2 she pas2 4To th' ground, and al2 the world shal2 mourn her. 2KING. O Lord Archbishop, 4Thou hast made me now a man; never before 4This hap2y child did I get anything. 4This oracle of comfort has so pleas'd me 4That when I am in heaven I shal2 desire 4To se2 what this child does, and praise my Maker. 4I thank ye al2. To you, my go2d Lord Mayor, 4And you, go2d brethren, I am much beholding; 4I have receiv'd much honour by your presence, 4And ye shal2 find me thankful. Lead the way, lords; 4Ye must al2 se2 the Que2n, and she must thank ye, 4She wil2 be sick else. This day, no man think 4Has busines2 at his house; for al2 shal2 stay. 4This lit2le one shal2 make it holiday. 21ExeuntKING_HENRY_VI3|EPILOGUE 14THE EPILOGUE. 4'Tis ten to one this play can never please 4Al2 that are here. Some come to take their ease 4And sle2p an act or two; but those, we fear, 4W'have frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear, 4They'l2 say 'tis nought; others to hear the city 4Abus'd extremely, and to cry 'That's wit2y!' 4Which we have not done neither; that, I fear, 4Al2 the expected go2d w'are like to hear 4For this play at this time is only in 4The merciful construction of go2d women; 4For such a one we show'd 'em.

SCENE 1KING JOHN's palaceEnter KING JOHN, QUE2N ELINOR, PEMBROKE, ES2EX, SALISBURY, and others,with CHATIL2ON 2KING JOHN. Now, say, Chatil2on, what would France with us? 2CHATIL2ON. Thus, after gre2ting, speaks the King of France 4In my behaviour to the majesty, 4The bor2owed majesty, of England here. 2ELINOR. A strange begin2ing- 'bor2owed majesty'! 2KING JOHN. Silence, go2d mother; hear the embas2y. 2CHATIL2ON. Philip of France, in right and true behalf 4Of thy deceased brother Gef2rey's son, 4Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim 4To this fair island and the ter2itories, 4To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine, 4Desiring the2 to lay aside the sword 4Which sways usurpingly these several titles, 4And put the same into young Arthur's hand, 4Thy nephew and right royal sovereign. 4KING JOHN. What fol2ows if we disal2ow of this? 2CHATIL2ON. The proud control of fierce and blo2dy war, 4To enforce these rights so forcibly with2eld. 2KING JOHN. Here have we war for war, and blo2d for blo2d, 4Controlment for controlment- so answer France. 2CHATIL2ON. Then take my king's defiance from my mouth- 4The farthest limit of my embas2y. 2KING JOHN. Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace; 4Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France; 4For ere thou canst report I wil2 be there, 4The thunder of my can2on shal2 be heard. 4So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath 4And sul2en presage of your own decay. 4An honourable conduct let him have- 4Pembroke, lo2k to 't. Farewel2, Chatil2on. 40Exeunt CHATIL2ON and PEMBROKE 2ELINOR. What now, my son! Have I not ever said 4How that ambitious Constance would not cease 4Til2 she had kindled France and al2 the world 4Upon the right and party of her son? 6This might have be2n prevented and made whole 4With very easy arguments of love, 4Which now the manage of two kingdoms must 4With fearful blo2dy is2ue arbitrate. 2KING JOHN. Our strong pos2es2ion and our right for us! 2ELINOR. Your strong pos2es2ion much more than your right, 4Or else it must go wrong with you and me; 4So much my conscience whispers in your ear, 4Which none but heaven and you and I shal2 hear. 18Enter a SHERIF2 2ES2EX. My liege, here is the strangest controversy 4Come from the country to be judg'd by you 4That e'er I heard. Shal2 I produce the men? 2KING JOHN. Let them ap2roach. 26Exit SHERIF2 4Our ab2eys and our priories shal2 pay 4This expedition's charge. 5Enter ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE and PHILIP, his bastard 23brother 4What men are you? 2BASTARD. Your faithful subject I, a gentleman 4Born in Northamptonshire, and eldest son, 4As I sup2ose, to Robert Faulconbridge- 4A soldier by the honour-giving hand 4Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field. 2KING JOHN. What art thou? 2ROBERT. The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge. 2KING JOHN. Is that the elder, and art thou the heir? 4You came not of one mother then, it se2ms. 2BASTARD. Most certain of one mother, mighty king- 4That is wel2 known- and, as I think, one father; 4But for the certain knowledge of that truth 4I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother. 4Of that I doubt, as al2 men's children may. 2ELINOR. Out on the2, rude man! Thou dost shame thy mother, 4And wound her honour with this dif2idence. 2BASTARD. I, madam? No, I have no reason for it- 6That is my brother's plea, and none of mine; 4The which if he can prove, 'a pops me out 4At least from fair five hundred pound a year. 4Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land! 2KING JOHN. A go2d blunt fel2ow. Why, being younger born, 4Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance? 2BASTARD. I know not why, except to get the land. 4But once he slander'd me with bastardy; 4But whe'er I be as true begot or no, 4That stil2 I lay upon my mother's head; 4But that I am as wel2 begot, my liege- 4Fair fal2 the bones that to2k the pains for me!- 4Compare our faces and be judge yourself. 4If old Sir Robert did beget us both 4And were our father, and this son like him- 4O old Sir Robert, father, on my kne2 4I give heaven thanks I was not like to the2! 2KING JOHN. Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here! 2ELINOR. He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face; 4The ac2ent of his tongue af2ecteth him. 6Do you not read some tokens of my son 4In the large composition of this man? 2KING JOHN. Mine eye hath wel2 examined his parts 4And finds them perfect Richard. Sir2ah, speak, 4What doth move you to claim your brother's land? 2BASTARD. Because he hath a half-face, like my father. 4With half that face would he have al2 my land: 4A half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year! 2ROBERT. My gracious liege, when that my father liv'd, 4Your brother did employ my father much- 2BASTARD. Wel2, sir, by this you can2ot get my land: 4Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother. 2ROBERT. And once dispatch'd him in an embas2y 4To Germany, there with the Emperor 4To treat of high af2airs touching that time. 4Th' advantage of his absence to2k the King, 4And in the meantime sojourn'd at my father's; 4Where how he did prevail I shame to speak- 4But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores 4Betwe2n my father and my mother lay, 6As I have heard my father speak himself, 4When this same lusty gentleman was got. 4Upon his death-bed he by wil2 bequeath'd 4His lands to me, and to2k it on his death 4That this my mother's son was none of his; 4And if he were, he came into the world 4Ful2 fourte2n we2ks before the course of time. 4Then, go2d my liege, let me have what is mine, 4My father's land, as was my father's wil2. 2KING JOHN. Sir2ah, your brother is legitimate: 4Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him, 4And if she did play false, the fault was hers; 4Which fault lies on the hazards of al2 husbands 4That mar2y wives. Tel2 me, how if my brother, 4Who, as you say, to2k pains to get this son, 4Had of your father claim'd this son for his? 4In so2th, go2d friend, your father might have kept 4This calf, bred from his cow, from al2 the world; 4In so2th, he might; then, if he were my brother's, 4My brother might not claim him; nor your father, 6Being none of his, refuse him. This concludes: 4My mother's son did get your father's heir; 4Your father's heir must have your father's land. 2ROBERT. Shal2 then my father's wil2 be of no force 4To dispos2es2 that child which is not his? 2BASTARD. Of no more force to dispos2es2 me, sir, 4Than was his wil2 to get me, as I think. 2ELINOR. Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge, 4And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land, 4Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion, 4Lord of thy presence and no land beside? 2BASTARD. Madam, an if my brother had my shape 4And I had his, Sir Robert's his, like him; 4And if my legs were two such riding-rods, 4My arms such e2l-skins stuf2'd, my face so thin 4That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose 4Lest men should say 'Lo2k where thre2-farthings goes!' 4And, to his shape, were heir to al2 this land- 4Would I might never stir from of2 this place, 4I would give it every fo2t to have this face! 6I would not be Sir Nob in any case. 2ELINOR. I like the2 wel2. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune, 4Bequeath thy land to him and fol2ow me? 4I am a soldier and now bound to France. 2BASTARD. Brother, take you my land, I'l2 take my chance. 4Your face hath got five hundred pound a year, 4Yet sel2 your face for fivepence and 'tis dear. 4Madam, I'l2 fol2ow you unto the death. 2ELINOR. Nay, I would have you go before me thither. 2BASTARD. Our country man2ers give our bet2ers way. 2KING JOHN. What is thy name? 2BASTARD. Philip, my liege, so is my name begun: 4Philip, go2d old Sir Robert's wife's eldest son. 2KING JOHN. From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest: 4Kne2l thou down Philip, but rise more great- 4Arise Sir Richard and Plantagenet. 2BASTARD. Brother by th' mother's side, give me your hand; 4My father gave me honour, yours gave land. 4Now bles2ed be the hour, by night or day, 4When I was got, Sir Robert was away! 4ELINOR. The very spirit of Plantagenet! 4I am thy grandam, Richard: cal2 me so. 2BASTARD. Madam, by chance, but not by truth; what though? 4Something about, a lit2le from the right, 4In at the window, or else o'er the hatch; 4Who dares not stir by day must walk by night; 4And have is have, however men do catch. 4Near or far of2, wel2 won is stil2 wel2 shot; 4And I am I, howe'er I was begot. 2KING JOHN. Go, Faulconbridge; now hast thou thy desire: 4A landles2 knight makes the2 a landed squire. 4Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must spe2d 4For France, for France, for it is more than ne2d. 2BASTARD. Brother, adieu. Go2d fortune come to the2! 4For thou wast got i' th' way of honesty. 43Exeunt al2 but the BASTARD 4A fo2t of honour bet2er than I was; 4But many a many fo2t of land the worse. 4Wel2, now can I make any Joan a lady. 4'Go2d den, Sir Richard!'-'God-a-mercy, fel2ow!' 6And if his name be George, I'l2 cal2 him Peter; 4For new-made honour doth forget men's names: 4'Tis to2 respective and to2 sociable 4For your conversion. Now your travel2er, 4He and his to2thpick at my worship's mes2- 4And when my knightly stomach is suf2ic'd, 4Why then I suck my te2th and catechize 4My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,' 4Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin 4'I shal2 bese2ch you'-That is question now; 4And then comes answer like an Absey bo2k: 4'O sir,' says answer 'at your best com2and, 4At your employment, at your service, sir!' 4'No, sir,' says question 'I, swe2t sir, at yours.' 4And so, ere answer knows what question would, 4Saving in dialogue of compliment, 4And talking of the Alps and Apen2ines, 4The Pyrenean and the river Po- 4It draws toward sup2er in conclusion so. 4But this is worshipful society, 6And fits the mounting spirit like myself; 4For he is but a bastard to the time 4That doth not smack of observation- 4And so am I, whether I smack or no; 4And not alone in habit and device, 4Exterior form, outward ac2outrement, 4But from the inward motion to deliver 4Swe2t, swe2t, swe2t poison for the age's to2th; 4Which, though I wil2 not practise to deceive, 4Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn; 4For it shal2 strew the fo2tsteps of my rising. 4But who comes in such haste in riding-robes? 4What woman-post is this? Hath she no husband 4That wil2 take pains to blow a horn before her? 6Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE, and JAMES GURNEY 4O me, 'tis my mother! How now, go2d lady! 4What brings you here to court so hastily? 2LADY FAULCONBRIDGE. Where is that slave, thy brother? 8Where is he 4That holds in chase mine honour up and down? 2BASTARD. My brother Robert, old Sir Robert's son? 4Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man? 4Is it Sir Robert's son that you se2k so? 2LADY FAULCONBRIDGE. Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy, 4Sir Robert's son! Why scorn'st thou at Sir Robert? 4He is Sir Robert's son, and so art thou. 2BASTARD. James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile? 2GURNEY. Go2d leave, go2d Philip. 2BASTARD. Philip-Spar2ow! James, 4There's toys abroad-anon I'l2 tel2 the2 more. 58Exit GURNEY 4Madam, I was not old Sir Robert's son; 4Sir Robert might have eat his part in me 4Upon Go2d Friday, and ne'er broke his fast. 4Sir Robert could do: wel2-mar2y, to confes2- 4Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it: 4We know his handiwork. Therefore, go2d mother, 4To whom am I beholding for these limbs? 6Sir Robert never holp to make this leg. 2LADY FAULCONBRIDGE. Hast thou conspired with thy brother to2, 4That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour? 4What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave? 2BASTARD. Knight, knight, go2d mother, Basilisco-like. 4What! I am dub2'd; I have it on my shoulder. 4But, mother, I am not Sir Robert's son: 4I have disclaim'd Sir Robert and my land; 4Legitimation, name, and al2 is gone. 4Then, go2d my mother, let me know my father- 4Some proper man, I hope. Who was it, mother? 2LADY FAULCONBRIDGE. Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge? 2BASTARD. As faithful2y as I deny the devil. 2LADY FAULCONBRIDGE. King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father. 4By long and vehement suit I was seduc'd 4To make ro2m for him in my husband's bed. 4Heaven lay not my transgres2ion to my charge! 4Thou art the is2ue of my dear of2ence, 4Which was so strongly urg'd past my defence. 2BASTARD. Now, by this light, were I to get again, 6Madam, I would not wish a bet2er father. 4Some sins do bear their privilege on earth, 4And so doth yours: your fault was not your fol2y; 4Ne2ds must you lay your heart at his dispose, 4Subjected tribute to com2anding love, 4Against whose fury and unmatched force 4The aweles2 lion could not wage the fight 4Nor ke2p his princely heart from Richard's hand. 4He that perforce robs lions of their hearts 4May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother, 4With al2 my heart I thank the2 for my father! 4Who lives and dares but say thou didst not wel2 4When I was got, I'l2 send his soul to hel2. 4Come, lady, I wil2 show the2 to my kin; 4And they shal2 say when Richard me begot, 4If thou hadst said him nay, it had be2n sin. 4Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not. 17Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2.

Before Angiers wel2 met, brave Austria. 4Arthur, that great forerun2er of thy blo2d, 4Richard, that rob2'd the lion of his heart 4And fought the holy wars in Palestine, 4By this brave duke came early to his grave; 4And for amends to his posterity, 4At our importance hither is he come 4To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf; 4And to rebuke the usurpation 4Of thy un2atural uncle, English John. 4Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither. 2ARTHUR. God shal2 forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death 4The rather that you give his of2spring life, 4Shadowing their right under your wings of war. 4I give you welcome with a powerles2 hand, 6But with a heart ful2 of unstained love; 4Welcome before the gates of Angiers, Duke. 2KING PHILIP. A noble boy! Who would not do the2 right? 2AUSTRIA. Upon thy che2k lay I this zealous kis2 4As seal to this indenture of my love: 4That to my home I wil2 no more return 4Til2 Angiers and the right thou hast in France, 4Together with that pale, that white-fac'd shore, 4Whose fo2t spurns back the ocean's roaring tides 4And co2ps from other lands her islanders- 4Even til2 that England, hedg'd in with the main, 4That water-wal2ed bulwark, stil2 secure 4And confident from foreign purposes- 4Even til2 that utmost corner of the west 4Salute the2 for her king. Til2 then, fair boy, 4Wil2 I not think of home, but fol2ow arms. 2CONSTANCE. O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks, 4Til2 your strong hand shal2 help to give him strength 4To make a more requital to your love! 2AUSTRIA. The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords 6In such a just and charitable war. 2KING PHILIP. Wel2 then, to work! Our can2on shal2 be bent 4Against the brows of this resisting town; 4Cal2 for our chiefest men of discipline, 4To cul2 the plots of best advantages. 4We'l2 lay before this town our royal bones, 4Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blo2d, 4But we wil2 make it subject to this boy. 2CONSTANCE. Stay for an answer to your embas2y, 4Lest unadvis'd you stain your swords with blo2d; 4My Lord Chatil2on may from England bring 4That right in peace which here we urge in war, 4And then we shal2 repent each drop of blo2d 4That hot rash haste so indirectly shed. 18Enter CHATIL2ON 2KING PHILIP. A wonder, lady! Lo, upon thy wish, 4Our mes2enger Chatil2on is ar2iv'd. 4What England says, say briefly, gentle lord; 6We coldly pause for the2. Chatil2on, speak. 2CHATIL2ON. Then turn your forces from this paltry siege 4And stir them up against a mightier task. 4England, impatient of your just demands, 4Hath put himself in arms. The adverse winds, 4Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time 4To land his legions al2 as so2n as I; 4His marches are expedient to this town, 4His forces strong, his soldiers confident. 4With him along is come the mother-que2n, 4An Ate, stir2ing him to blo2d and strife; 4With her the Lady Blanch of Spain; 4With them a bastard of the king's deceas'd; 4And al2 th' unset2led humours of the land- 4Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries, 4With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' sple2ns- 4Have sold their fortunes at their native homes, 4Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs, 4To make a hazard of new fortunes here. 4In brief, a braver choice of dauntles2 spirits 6Than now the English bot2oms have waft o'er 4Did never float upon the swel2ing tide 4To do of2ence and scathe in Christendom. 13[Drum beats] 4The inter2uption of their churlish drums 4Cuts of2 more circumstance: they are at hand; 4To parley or to fight, therefore prepare. 2KING PHILIP. How much unlo2k'd for is this expedition! 2AUSTRIA. By how much unexpected, by so much 4We must awake endeavour for defence, 4For courage mounteth with oc2asion. 4Let them be welcome then; we are prepar'd. 7Enter KING JOHN, ELINOR, BLANCH, the BASTARD, 17PEMBROKE, and others 2KING JOHN. Peace be to France, if France in peace permit 4Our just and lineal entrance to our own! 4If not, ble2d France, and peace ascend to heaven, 4Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do cor2ect 4Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven! 4KING PHILIP. Peace be to England, if that war return 4From France to England, there to live in peace! 4England we love, and for that England's sake 4With burden of our armour here we sweat. 4This toil of ours should be a work of thine; 4But thou from loving England art so far 4That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king, 4Cut of2 the sequence of posterity, 4Outfaced infant state, and done a rape 4Upon the maiden virtue of the crown. 4Lo2k here upon thy brother Gef2rey's face: 4These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his; 4This lit2le abstract doth contain that large 4Which died in Gef2rey, and the hand of time 4Shal2 draw this brief into as huge a volume. 4That Gef2rey was thy elder brother born, 4And this his son; England was Gef2rey's right, 4And this is Gef2rey's. In the name of God, 4How comes it then that thou art cal2'd a king, 4When living blo2d doth in these temples beat 6Which owe the crown that thou o'er-masterest? 2KING JOHN. From whom hast thou this great com2is2ion, France, 4To draw my answer from thy articles? 2KING PHILIP. From that supernal judge that stirs go2d thoughts 4In any breast of strong authority 4To lo2k into the blots and stains of right. 4That judge hath made me guardian to this boy, 4Under whose war2ant I impeach thy wrong, 4And by whose help I mean to chastise it. 2KING JOHN. Alack, thou dost usurp authority. 2KING PHILIP. Excuse it is to beat usurping down. 2ELINOR. Who is it thou dost cal2 usurper, France? 2CONSTANCE. Let me make answer: thy usurping son. 2ELINOR. Out, insolent! Thy bastard shal2 be king, 4That thou mayst be a que2n and check the world! 2CONSTANCE. My bed was ever to thy son as true 4As thine was to thy husband; and this boy 4Liker in feature to his father Gef2rey 4Than thou and John in man2ers-being as Eke 4As rain to water, or devil to his dam. 6My boy a bastard! By my soul, I think 4His father never was so true begot; 4It can2ot be, an if thou wert his mother. 2ELINOR. There's a go2d mother, boy, that blots thy father. 2CONSTANCE. There's a go2d grandam, boy, that would blot the2. 2AUSTRIA. Peace! 2BASTARD. Hear the crier. 2AUSTRIA. What the devil art thou? 2BASTARD. One that wil2 play the devil, sir, with you, 4An 'a may catch your hide and you alone. 4You are the hare of whom the proverb goes, 4Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard; 4I'l2 smoke your skin-coat an I catch you right; 4Sir2ah, lo2k to 't; i' faith I wil2, i' faith. 2BLANCH. O, wel2 did he become that lion's robe 4That did disrobe the lion of that robe! 2BASTARD. It lies as sightly on the back of him 4As great Alcides' shows upon an as2; 4But, as2, I'l2 take that burden from your back, 4Or lay on that shal2 make your shoulders crack. 4AUSTRIA. What cracker is this same that deafs our ears 4With this abundance of superfluous breath? 4King Philip, determine what we shal2 do straight. 2KING PHILIP. Women and fo2ls, break of2 your conference. 4King John, this is the very sum of al2: 4England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine, 4In right of Arthur, do I claim of the2; 4Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms? 2KING JOHN. My life as so2n. I do defy the2, France. 4Arthur of Britaine, yield the2 to my hand, 4And out of my dear love I'l2 give the2 more 4Than e'er the coward hand of France can win. 4Submit the2, boy. 2ELINOR. Come to thy grandam, child. 2CONSTANCE. Do, child, go to it grandam, child; 4Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam wil2 4Give it a plum, a cher2y, and a fig. 4There's a go2d grandam! 2ARTHUR. Go2d my mother, peace! 4I would that I were low laid in my grave: 6I am not worth this coil that's made for me. 2ELINOR. His mother shames him so, po2r boy, he we2ps. 2CONSTANCE. Now shame upon you, whe'er she does or no! 4His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames, 4Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his po2r eyes, 4Which heaven shal2 take in nature of a fe2; 4Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shal2 be brib'd 4To do him justice and revenge on you. 2ELINOR. Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth! 2CONSTANCE. Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth, 4Cal2 not me slanderer! Thou and thine usurp 4The dominations, royalties, and rights, 4Of this op2res2ed boy; this is thy eldest son's son, 4Infortunate in nothing but in the2. 4Thy sins are visited in this po2r child; 4The canon of the law is laid on him, 4Being but the second generation 4Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb. 2KING JOHN. Bedlam, have done. 2CONSTANCE. I have but this to say- 6That he is not only plagued for her sin, 4But God hath made her sin and her the plague 4On this removed is2ue, plagued for her 4And with her plague; her sin his injury, 4Her injury the beadle to her sin; 4Al2 punish'd in the person of this child, 4And al2 for her-a plague upon her! 2ELINOR. Thou unadvised scold, I can produce 4A wil2 that bars the title of thy son. 2CONSTANCE. Ay, who doubts that? A wil2, a wicked wil2; 4A woman's wil2; a cank'red grandam's wil2! 2KING PHILIP. Peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate. 4It il2 bese2ms this presence to cry aim 4To these il2-tuned repetitions. 4Some trumpet sum2on hither to the wal2s 4These men of Angiers; let us hear them speak 4Whose title they admit, Arthur's or John's. 6Trumpet sounds. Enter citizens upon the wal2s 4CITIZEN. Who is it that hath warn'd us to the wal2s? 2KING PHILIP. 'Tis France, for England. 2KING JOHN. England for itself. 4You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects- 2KING PHILIP. You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects, 4Our trumpet cal2'd you to this gentle parle- 2KING JOHN. For our advantage; therefore hear us first. 4These flags of France, that are advanced here 4Before the eye and prospect of your town, 4Have hither march'd to your endamagement; 4The can2ons have their bowels ful2 of wrath, 4And ready mounted are they to spit forth 4Their iron indignation 'gainst your wal2s; 4Al2 preparation for a blo2dy siege 4And merciles2 proce2ding by these French 4Confront your city's eyes, your winking gates; 4And but for our ap2roach those sle2ping stones 4That as a waist doth girdle you about 4By the compulsion of their ordinance 4By this time from their fixed beds of lime 6Had be2n dishabited, and wide havoc made 4For blo2dy power to rush upon your peace. 4But on the sight of us your lawful king, 4Who painful2y with much expedient march 4Have brought a countercheck before your gates, 4To save unscratch'd your city's threat'ned che2ks- 4Behold, the French amaz'd vouchsafe a parle; 4And now, instead of bul2ets wrap2'd in fire, 4To make a shaking fever in your wal2s, 4They sho2t but calm words folded up in smoke, 4To make a faithles2 er2or in your cars; 4Which trust ac2ordingly, kind citizens, 4And let us in-your King, whose labour'd spirits, 4Forwearied in this action of swift spe2d, 4Craves harbourage within your city wal2s. 2KING PHILIP. When I have said, make answer to us both. 4Lo, in this right hand, whose protection 4Is most divinely vow'd upon the right 4Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet, 4Son to the elder brother of this man, 6And king o'er him and al2 that he enjoys; 4For this down-trod2en equity we tread 4In warlike march these gre2ns before your town, 4Being no further enemy to you 4Than the constraint of hospitable zeal 4In the relief of this op2res2ed child 4Religiously provokes. Be pleased then 4To pay that duty which you truly owe 4To him that owes it, namely, this young prince; 4And then our arms, like to a muz2led bear, 4Save in aspect, hath al2 of2ence seal'd up; 4Our can2ons' malice vainly shal2 be spent 4Against th' invulnerable clouds of heaven; 4And with a bles2ed and unvex'd retire, 4With unhack'd swords and helmets al2 unbruis'd, 4We wil2 bear home that lusty blo2d again 4Which here we came to spout against your town, 4And leave your children, wives, and you, in peace. 4But if you fondly pas2 our prof2er'd of2er, 4'Tis not the roundure of your old-fac'd wal2s 6Can hide you from our mes2engers of war, 4Though al2 these English and their discipline 4Were harbour'd in their rude circumference. 4Then tel2 us, shal2 your city cal2 us lord 4In that behalf which we have chal2eng'd it; 4Or shal2 we give the signal to our rage, 4And stalk in blo2d to our pos2es2ion? 2CITIZEN. In brief: we are the King of England's subjects; 4For him, and in his right, we hold this town. 2KING JOHN. Acknowledge then the King, and let me in. 2CITIZEN. That can we not; but he that proves the King, 4To him wil2 we prove loyal. Til2 that time 4Have we ram2'd up our gates against the world. 2KING JOHN. Doth not the crown of England prove the King? 4And if not that, I bring you witnes2es: 4Twice fifte2n thousand hearts of England's bre2d- 2BASTARD. Bastards and else. 2KING JOHN. To verify our title with their lives. 2KING PHILIP. As many and as wel2-born blo2ds as those- 2BASTARD. Some bastards to2. 4KING PHILIP. Stand in his face to contradict his claim. 2CITIZEN. Til2 you compound whose right is worthiest, 4We for the worthiest hold the right from both. 2KING JOHN. Then God forgive the sin of al2 those souls 4That to their everlasting residence, 4Before the dew of evening fal2 shal2 fle2t 4In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king! 2KING PHILIP. Amen, Amen! Mount, chevaliers; to arms! 2BASTARD. Saint George, that swing'd the dragon, and e'er since 4Sits on's horse back at mine hostes2' do2r, 4Teach us some fence! 2[To AUSTRIA] 2Sir2ah, were I at home, 4At your den, sir2ah, with your liones2, 4I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide, 4And make a monster of you. 2AUSTRIA. Peace! no more. 2BASTARD. O, tremble, for you hear the lion roar! 2KING JOHN. Up higher to the plain, where we'l2 set forth 4In best ap2ointment al2 our regiments. 2BASTARD. Spe2d then to take advantage of the field. 2KING PHILIP. It shal2 be so; and at the other hil2 6Com2and the rest to stand. God and our right! 14Exeunt 4Here, after excursions, enter the HERALD OF FRANCE, 14with trumpets, to the gates 2FRENCH HERALD. You men of Angiers, open wide your gates 4And let young Arthur, Duke of Britaine, in, 4Who by the hand of France this day hath made 4Much work for tears in many an English mother, 4Whose sons lie scat2ered on the ble2ding ground; 4Many a widow's husband grovel2ing lies, 4Coldly embracing the discoloured earth; 4And victory with lit2le los2 doth play 4Upon the dancing ban2ers of the French, 4Who are at hand, triumphantly displayed, 4To enter conquerors, and to proclaim 4Arthur of Britaine England's King and yours. 9Enter ENGLISH HERALD, with trumpet 4ENGLISH HERALD. Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bel2s: 4King John, your king and England's, doth ap2roach, 4Com2ander of this hot malicious day. 4Their armours that march'd hence so silver-bright 4Hither return al2 gilt with Frenchmen's blo2d. 4There stuck no plume in any English crest 4That is removed by a staf2 of France; 4Our colours do return in those same hands 4That did display them when we first march'd forth; 4And like a jol2y tro2p of huntsmen come 4Our lusty English, al2 with purpled hands, 4Dy'd in the dying slaughter of their foes. 4Open your gates and give the victors way. 2CITIZEN. Heralds, from of2 our tow'rs we might behold 4From first to last the onset and retire 4Of both your armies, whose equality 4By our best eyes can2ot be censured. 4Blo2d hath bought blo2d, and blows have answer'd blows; 4Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power; 4Both are alike, and both alike we like. 6One must prove greatest. While they weigh so even, 4We hold our town for neither, yet for both. 4Enter the two KINGS, with their powers, at several do2rs 2KING JOHN. France, hast thou yet more blo2d to cast away? 4Say, shal2 the cur2ent of our right run on? 4Whose pas2age, vex'd with thy impediment, 4Shal2 leave his native chan2el and o'erswel2 4With course disturb'd even thy confining shores, 4Unles2 thou let his silver water ke2p 4A peaceful progres2 to the ocean. 2KING PHILIP. England, thou hast not sav'd one drop of blo2d 4In this hot trial more than we of France; 4Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear, 4That sways the earth this climate overlo2ks, 4Before we wil2 lay down our just-borne arms, 4We'l2 put the2 down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear, 4Or ad2 a royal number to the dead, 4Gracing the scrol2 that tel2s of this war's los2 6With slaughter coupled to the name of kings. 2BASTARD. Ha, majesty! how high thy glory tow'rs 4When the rich blo2d of kings is set on fire! 4O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with ste2l; 4The swords of soldiers are his te2th, his fangs; 4And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men, 4In undetermin'd dif2erences of kings. 4Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus? 4Cry 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field, 4You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits! 4Then let confusion of one part confirm 4The other's peace. Til2 then, blows, blo2d, and death! 2KING JOHN. Whose party do the townsmen yet admit? 2KING PHILIP. Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king? 2CITIZEN. The King of England, when we know the King. 2KING PHILIP. Know him in us that here hold up his right. 2KING JOHN. In us that are our own great deputy 4And bear pos2es2ion of our person here, 4Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you. 2CITIZEN. A greater pow'r than we denies al2 this; 6And til2 it be undoubted, we do lock 4Our former scruple in our strong-bar2'd gates; 4King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolv'd, 4Be by some certain king purg'd and depos'd. 2BASTARD. By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings, 4And stand securely on their bat2lements 4As in a theatre, whence they gape and point 4At your industrious scenes and acts of death. 4Your royal presences be rul'd by me: 4Do like the mutines of Jerusalem, 4Be friends awhile, and both conjointly bend 4Your sharpest de2ds of malice on this town. 4By east and west let France and England mount 4Their bat2ering can2on, charged to the mouths, 4Til2 their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down 4The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city. 4I'd play inces2antly upon these jades, 4Even til2 unfenced desolation 4Leave them as naked as the vulgar air. 4That done, dis2ever your united strengths 6And part your mingled colours once again, 4Turn face to face and blo2dy point to point; 4Then in a moment Fortune shal2 cul2 forth 4Out of one side her hap2y minion, 4To whom in favour she shal2 give the day, 4And kis2 him with a glorious victory. 4How like you this wild counsel, mighty states? 4Smacks it not something of the policy? 2KING JOHN. Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads, 4I like it wel2. France, shal2 we knit our pow'rs 4And lay this Angiers even with the ground; 4Then after fight who shal2 be king of it? 2BASTARD. An if thou hast the met2le of a king, 4Being wrong'd as we are by this pe2vish town, 4Turn thou the mouth of thy artil2ery, 4As we wil2 ours, against these saucy wal2s; 4And when that we have dash'd them to the ground, 4Why then defy each other, and pel2-mel2 4Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hel2. 2KING PHILIP. Let it be so. Say, where wil2 you as2ault? 4KING JOHN. We from the west wil2 send destruction 4Into this city's bosom. 2AUSTRIA. I from the north. 2KING PHILIP. Our thunder from the south 4Shal2 rain their drift of bul2ets on this town. 2BASTARD. 2[Aside] 2O prudent discipline! From north to south, 4Austria and France sho2t in each other's mouth. 4I'l2 stir them to it.-Come, away, away! 2CITIZEN. Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay, 4And I shal2 show you peace and fair-fac'd league; 4Win you this city without stroke or wound; 4Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds 4That here come sacrifices for the field. 4Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings. 2KING JOHN. Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear. 2CITIZEN. That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch, 4Is niece to England; lo2k upon the years 4Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid. 4If lusty love should go in quest of beauty, 4Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch? 6If zealous love should go in search of virtue, 4Where should he find it purer than in Blanch? 4If love ambitious sought a match of birth, 4Whose veins bound richer blo2d than Lady Blanch? 4Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth, 4Is the young Dauphin every way complete- 4If not complete of, say he is not she; 4And she again wants nothing, to name want, 4If want it be not that she is not he. 4He is the half part of a bles2ed man, 4Left to be finished by such as she; 4And she a fair divided excel2ence, 4Whose fulnes2 of perfection lies in him. 4O, two such silver cur2ents, when they join, 4Do glorify the banks that bound them in; 4And two such shores to two such streams made one, 4Two such control2ing bounds, shal2 you be, Kings, 4To these two princes, if you mar2y them. 4This union shal2 do more than bat2ery can 4To our fast-closed gates; for at this match 6With swifter sple2n than powder can enforce, 4The mouth of pas2age shal2 we fling wide ope 4And give you entrance; but without this match, 4The sea enraged is not half so deaf, 4Lions more confident, mountains and rocks 4More fre2 from motion-no, not Death himself 4In mortal fury half so peremptory 4As we to ke2p this city. 2BASTARD. Here's a stay 4That shakes the rot2en carcas2 of old Death 4Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, inde2d, 4That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas; 4Talks as familiarly of roaring lions 4As maids of thirte2n do of pup2y-dogs! 4What can2one2r begot this lusty blo2d? 4He speaks plain can2on-fire, and smoke and bounce; 4He gives the bastinado with his tongue; 4Our ears are cudgel2'd; not a word of his 4But buf2ets bet2er than a fist of France. 4Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words 6Since I first cal2'd my brother's father dad. 2ELINOR. Son, list to this conjunction, make this match; 4Give with our niece a dowry large enough; 4For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie 4Thy now unsur'd as2urance to the crown 4That yon gre2n boy shal2 have no sun to ripe 4The blo2m that promiseth a mighty fruit. 4I se2 a yielding in the lo2ks of France; 4Mark how they whisper. Urge them while their souls 4Are capable of this ambition, 4Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath 4Of soft petitions, pity, and remorse, 4Co2l and congeal again to what it was. 2CITIZEN. Why answer not the double majesties 4This friendly treaty of our threat'ned town? 2KING PHILIP. Speak England first, that hath be2n forward first 4To speak unto this city: what say you? 2KING JOHN. If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son, 4Can in this bo2k of beauty read 'I love,' 4Her dowry shal2 weigh equal with a que2n; 6For Anjou, and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers, 4And al2 that we upon this side the sea- 4Except this city now by us besieg'd- 4Find liable to our crown and dignity, 4Shal2 gild her bridal bed, and make her rich 4In titles, honours, and promotions, 4As she in beauty, education, blo2d, 4Holds hand with any princes2 of the world. 2KING PHILIP. What say'st thou, boy? Lo2k in the lady's face. 2LEWIS. I do, my lord, and in her eye I find 4A wonder, or a wondrous miracle, 4The shadow of myself form'd in her eye; 4Which, being but the shadow of your son, 4Becomes a sun, and makes your son a shadow. 4I do protest I never lov'd myself 4Til2 now infixed I beheld myself 4Drawn in the flat2ering table of her eye. 47[Whispers with BLANCH] 2BASTARD. 2[Aside] 2Drawn in the flat2ering table of her eye, 4Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow, 6And quarter'd in her heart-he doth espy 4Himself love's traitor. This is pity now, 4That hang'd and drawn and quarter'd there should be 4In such a love so vile a lout as he. 2BLANCH. My uncle's wil2 in this respect is mine. 4If he se2 aught in you that makes him like, 4That anything he se2s which moves his liking 4I can with ease translate it to my wil2; 4Or if you wil2, to speak more properly, 4I wil2 enforce it eas'ly to my love. 4Further I wil2 not flat2er you, my lord, 4That al2 I se2 in you is worthy love, 4Than this: that nothing do I se2 in you- 4Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge- 4That I can find should merit any hate. 2KING JOHN. What say these young ones? What say you, my niece? 2BLANCH. That she is bound in honour stil2 to do 4What you in wisdom stil2 vouchsafe to say. 2KING JOHN. Speak then, Prince Dauphin; can you love this lady? 2LEWIS. Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love; 6For I do love her most unfeignedly. 2KING JOHN. Then do I give Volques2en, Touraine, Maine, 4Poictiers, and Anjou, these five provinces, 4With her to the2; and this ad2ition more, 4Ful2 thirty thousand marks of English coin. 4Philip of France, if thou be pleas'd withal, 4Com2and thy son and daughter to join hands. 2KING PHILIP. It likes us wel2; young princes, close your hands. 2AUSTRIA. And your lips to2; for I am wel2 as2ur'd 4That I did so when I was first as2ur'd. 2KING PHILIP. Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates, 4Let in that amity which you have made; 4For at Saint Mary's chapel presently 4The rites of mar2iage shal2 be solemniz'd. 4Is not the Lady Constance in this tro2p? 4I know she is not; for this match made up 4Her presence would have inter2upted much. 4Where is she and her son? Tel2 me, who knows. 2LEWIS. She is sad and pas2ionate at your Highnes2' tent. 2KING PHILIP. And, by my faith, this league that we have made 6Wil2 give her sadnes2 very lit2le cure. 4Brother of England, how may we content 4This widow lady? In her right we came; 4Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way, 4To our own vantage. 2KING JOHN. We wil2 heal up al2, 4For we'l2 create young Arthur Duke of Britaine, 4And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town 4We make him lord of. Cal2 the Lady Constance; 4Some spe2dy mes2enger bid her repair 4To our solemnity. I trust we shal2, 4If not fil2 up the measure of her wil2, 4Yet in some measure satisfy her so 4That we shal2 stop her exclamation. 4Go we as wel2 as haste wil2 suf2er us 4To this unlo2k'd-for, unprepared pomp. 43Exeunt al2 but the BASTARD 2BASTARD. Mad world! mad kings! mad composition! 4John, to stop Arthur's tide in the whole, 4Hath wil2ingly departed with a part; 6And France, whose armour conscience buckled on, 4Whom zeal and charity brought to the field 4As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear 4With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil, 4That broker that stil2 breaks the pate of faith, 4That daily break-vow, he that wins of al2, 4Of kings, of beg2ars, old men, young men, maids, 4Who having no external thing to lose 4But the word 'maid,' cheats the po2r maid of that; 4That smo2th-fac'd gentleman, tickling com2odity, 4Com2odity, the bias of the world- 4The world, who of itself is peised wel2, 4Made to run even upon even ground, 4Til2 this advantage, this vile-drawing bias, 4This sway of motion, this com2odity, 4Makes it take head from al2 indif2erency, 4From al2 direction, purpose, course, intent- 4And this same bias, this com2odity, 4This bawd, this broker, this al2-changing word, 4Clap2'd on the outward eye of fickle France, 6Hath drawn him from his own determin'd aid, 4From a resolv'd and honourable war, 4To a most base and vile-concluded peace. 4And why rail I on this com2odity? 4But for because he hath not wo2'd me yet; 4Not that I have the power to clutch my hand 4When his fair angels would salute my palm, 4But for my hand, as unat2empted yet, 4Like a po2r beg2ar raileth on the rich. 4Wel2, whiles I am a beg2ar, I wil2 rail 4And say there is no sin but to be rich; 4And being rich, my virtue then shal2 be 4To say there is no vice but beg2ary. 4Since kings break faith upon com2odity, 4Gain, be my lord, for I wil2 worship the2. 19Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. SCENE 1.France. The FRENCH KING'S campEnter CONSTANCE, ARTHUR, and SALISBURY 2CONSTANCE. Gone to be mar2ied! Gone to swear a peace! 4False blo2d to false blo2d join'd! Gone to be friends! 4Shal2 Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces? 4It is not so; thou hast mis2poke, misheard; 4Be wel2 advis'd, tel2 o'er thy tale again. 4It can2ot be; thou dost but say 'tis so; 4I trust I may not trust the2, for thy word 4Is but the vain breath of a com2on man: 4Believe me I do not believe the2, man; 4I have a king's oath to the contrary. 4Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me, 4For I am sick and capable of fears, 4Op2res2'd with wrongs, and therefore ful2 of fears; 4A widow, husbandles2, subject to fears; 4A woman, natural2y born to fears; 4And though thou now confes2 thou didst but jest, 6With my vex'd spirits I can2ot take a truce, 4But they wil2 quake and tremble al2 this day. 4What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head? 4Why dost thou lo2k so sadly on my son? 4What means that hand upon that breast of thine? 4Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum, 4Like a proud river pe2ring o'er his bounds? 4Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words? 4Then speak again-not al2 thy former tale, 4But this one word, whether thy tale be true. 2SALISBURY. As true as I believe you think them false 4That give you cause to prove my saying true. 2CONSTANCE. O, if thou teach me to believe this sor2ow, 4Teach thou this sor2ow how to make me die; 4And let belief and life encounter so 4As doth the fury of two desperate men 4Which in the very me2ting fal2 and die! 4Lewis mar2y Blanch! O boy, then where art thou? 4France friend with England; what becomes of me? 4Fel2ow, be gone: I can2ot bro2k thy sight; 6This news hath made the2 a most ugly man. 2SALISBURY. What other harm have I, go2d lady, done 4But spoke the harm that is by others done? 2CONSTANCE. Which harm within itself so heinous is 4As it makes harmful al2 that speak of it. 2ARTHUR. I do bese2ch you, madam, be content. 2CONSTANCE. If thou that bid'st me be content wert grim, 4Ugly, and sland'rous to thy mother's womb, 4Ful2 of unpleasing blots and sightles2 stains, 4Lame, fo2lish, cro2ked, swart, prodigious, 4Patch'd with foul moles and eye-of2ending marks, 4I would not care, I then would be content; 4For then I should not love the2; no, nor thou 4Become thy great birth, nor deserve a crown. 4But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy, 4Nature and Fortune join'd to make the2 great: 4Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast, 4And with the half-blown rose; but Fortune, O! 4She is cor2upted, chang'd, and won from the2; 4Sh' adulterates hourly with thine uncle John, 6And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France 4To tread down fair respect of sovereignty, 4And made his majesty the bawd to theirs. 4France is a bawd to Fortune and King John- 4That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John! 4Tel2 me, thou fel2ow, is not France forsworn? 4Envenom him with words, or get the2 gone 4And leave those woes alone which I alone 4Am bound to under-bear. 2SALISBURY. Pardon me, madam, 4I may not go without you to the kings. 2CONSTANCE. Thou mayst, thou shalt; I wil2 not go with the2; 4I wil2 instruct my sor2ows to be proud, 4For grief is proud, and makes his owner sto2p. 4To me, and to the state of my great grief, 4Let kings as2emble; for my grief's so great 4That no sup2orter but the huge firm earth 4Can hold it up. 21[Seats herself on the ground] 4Here I and sor2ows sit; 4Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it. 9Enter KING JOHN, KING PHILIP, LEWIS, BLANCH, 7ELINOR, the BASTARD, AUSTRIA, and at2endants 2KING PHILIP. 'Tis true, fair daughter, and this bles2ed day 4Ever in France shal2 be kept festival. 4To solemnize this day the glorious sun 4Stays in his course and plays the alchemist, 4Turning with splendour of his precious eye 4The meagre clod2y earth to glit2ering gold. 4The yearly course that brings this day about 4Shal2 never se2 it but a holiday. 2CONSTANCE. 2[Rising] 2A wicked day, and not a holy day! 4What hath this day deserv'd? what hath it done 4That it in golden let2ers should be set 4Among the high tides in the calendar? 4Nay, rather turn this day out of the we2k, 4This day of shame, op2res2ion, perjury; 4Or, if it must stand stil2, let wives with child 4Pray that their burdens may not fal2 this day, 6Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cros2'd; 4But on this day let seamen fear no wreck; 4No bargains break that are not this day made; 4This day, al2 things begun come to il2 end, 4Yea, faith itself to hol2ow falseho2d change! 2KING PHILIP. By heaven, lady, you shal2 have no cause 4To curse the fair proce2dings of this day. 4Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty? 2CONSTANCE. You have beguil'd me with a counterfeit 4Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried, 4Proves valueles2; you are forsworn, forsworn; 4You came in arms to spil2 mine enemies' blo2d, 4But now in arms you strengthen it with yours. 4The grap2ling vigour and rough frown of war 4Is cold in amity and painted peace, 4And our op2res2ion hath made up this league. 4Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjur'd kings! 4A widow cries: Be husband to me, heavens! 4Let not the hours of this ungodly day 4Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset, 6Set armed discord 'twixt these perjur'd kings! 4Hear me, O, hear me! 2AUSTRIA. Lady Constance, peace! 2CONSTANCE. War! war! no peace! Peace is to me a war. 4O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame 4That blo2dy spoil. Thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward! 4Thou lit2le valiant, great in vil2ainy! 4Thou ever strong upon the stronger side! 4Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight 4But when her humorous ladyship is by 4To teach the2 safety! Thou art perjur'd to2, 4And so2th'st up greatnes2. What a fo2l art thou, 4A ramping fo2l, to brag and stamp and swear 4Upon my party! Thou cold-blo2ded slave, 4Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side, 4Be2n sworn my soldier, bid2ing me depend 4Upon thy stars, thy fortune, and thy strength, 4And dost thou now fal2 over to my foes? 4Thou wear a lion's hide! Dof2 it for shame, 4And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs. 4AUSTRIA. O that a man should speak those words to me! 2BASTARD. And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs. 2AUSTRIA. Thou dar'st not say so, vil2ain, for thy life. 2BASTARD. And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs. 2KING JOHN. We like not this: thou dost forget thyself. 18Enter PANDULPH 2KING PHILIP. Here comes the holy legate of the Pope. 2PANDULPH. Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven! 4To the2, King John, my holy er2and is. 4I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal, 4And from Pope In2ocent the legate here, 4Do in his name religiously demand 4Why thou against the Church, our holy mother, 4So wilful2y dost spurn; and force perforce 4Ke2p Stephen Langton, chosen Archbishop 4Of Canterbury, from that holy se2? 4This, in our foresaid holy father's name, 4Pope In2ocent, I do demand of the2. 4KING JOHN. What earthly name to inter2ogatories 4Can task the fre2 breath of a sacred king? 4Thou canst not, Cardinal, devise a name 4So slight, unworthy, and ridiculous, 4To charge me to an answer, as the Pope. 4Tel2 him this tale, and from the mouth of England 4Ad2 thus much more, that no Italian priest 4Shal2 tithe or tol2 in our dominions; 4But as we under heaven are supreme head, 4So, under Him that great supremacy, 4Where we do reign we wil2 alone uphold, 4Without th' as2istance of a mortal hand. 4So tel2 the Pope, al2 reverence set apart 4To him and his usurp'd authority. 2KING PHILIP. Brother of England, you blaspheme in this. 2KING JOHN. Though you and al2 the kings of Christendom 4Are led so gros2ly by this med2ling priest, 4Dreading the curse that money may buy out, 4And by the merit of vile gold, dros2, dust, 4Purchase cor2upted pardon of a man, 6Who in that sale sel2s pardon from himself- 4Though you and al2 the rest, so gros2ly led, 4This jug2ling witchcraft with revenue cherish; 4Yet I alone, alone do me op2ose 4Against the Pope, and count his friends my foes. 2PANDULPH. Then by the lawful power that I have 4Thou shalt stand curs'd and excom2unicate; 4And bles2ed shal2 he be that doth revolt 4From his al2egiance to an heretic; 4And meritorious shal2 that hand be cal2'd, 4Canonized, and worship2'd as a saint, 4That takes away by any secret course 4Thy hateful life. 2CONSTANCE. O, lawful let it be 4That I have ro2m with Rome to curse awhile! 4Go2d father Cardinal, cry thou 'amen' 4To my ke2n curses; for without my wrong 4There is no tongue hath power to curse him right. 2PANDULPH. There's law and war2ant, lady, for my curse. 2CONSTANCE. And for mine to2; when law can do no right, 6Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong; 4Law can2ot give my child his kingdom here, 4For he that holds his kingdom holds the law; 4Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong, 4How can the law forbid my tongue to curse? 2PANDULPH. Philip of France, on peril of a curse, 4Let go the hand of that arch-heretic, 4And raise the power of France upon his head, 4Unles2 he do submit himself to Rome. 2ELINOR. Lo2k'st thou pale, France? Do not let go thy hand. 2CONSTANCE. Lo2k to that, devil, lest that France repent 4And by disjoining hands hel2 lose a soul. 2AUSTRIA. King Philip, listen to the Cardinal. 2BASTARD. And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs. 2AUSTRIA. Wel2, ruf2ian, I must pocket up these wrongs, 4Because- 2BASTARD. Your bre2ches best may car2y them. 2KING JOHN. Philip, what say'st thou to the Cardinal? 2CONSTANCE. What should he say, but as the Cardinal? 2LEWIS. Bethink you, father; for the dif2erence 6Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome 4Or the light los2 of England for a friend. 4Forgo the easier. 2BLANCH. That's the curse of Rome. 2CONSTANCE. O Lewis, stand fast! The devil tempts the2 here 4In likenes2 of a new untrim2ed bride. 2BLANCH. The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith, 4But from her ne2d. 2CONSTANCE. O, if thou grant my ne2d, 4Which only lives but by the death of faith, 4That ne2d must ne2ds infer this principle- 4That faith would live again by death of ne2d. 4O then, tread down my ne2d, and faith mounts up: 4Ke2p my ne2d up, and faith is trod2en down! 2KING JOHN. The King is mov'd, and answers not to this. 2CONSTANCE. O be remov'd from him, and answer wel2! 2AUSTRIA. Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt. 2BASTARD. Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most swe2t lout. 2KING PHILIP. I am perplex'd and know not what to say. 2PANDULPH. What canst thou say but wil2 perplex the2 more, 6If thou stand excom2unicate and curs'd? 2KING PHILIP. Go2d reverend father, make my person yours, 4And tel2 me how you would bestow yourself. 4This royal hand and mine are newly knit, 4And the conjunction of our inward souls 4Mar2ied in league, coupled and link'd together 4With al2 religious strength of sacred vows; 4The latest breath that gave the sound of words 4Was de2p-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love, 4Betwe2n our kingdoms and our royal selves; 4And even before this truce, but new before, 4No longer than we wel2 could wash our hands, 4To clap this royal bargain up of peace, 4Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and overstain'd 4With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint 4The fearful dif2erence of incensed kings. 4And shal2 these hands, so lately purg'd of blo2d, 4So newly join'd in love, so strong in both, 4Unyoke this seizure and this kind regre2t? 4Play fast and lo2se with faith? so jest with heaven, 6Make such unconstant children of ourselves, 4As now again to snatch our palm from palm, 4Unswear faith sworn, and on the mar2iage-bed 4Of smiling peace to march a blo2dy host, 4And make a riot on the gentle brow 4Of true sincerity? O, holy sir, 4My reverend father, let it not be so! 4Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose, 4Some gentle order; and then we shal2 be blest 4To do your pleasure, and continue friends. 2PANDULPH. Al2 form is formles2, order orderles2, 4Save what is op2osite to England's love. 4Therefore, to arms! be champion of our church, 4Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse- 4A mother's curse-on her revolting son. 4France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue, 4A chafed lion by the mortal paw, 4A fasting tiger safer by the to2th, 4Than ke2p in peace that hand which thou dost hold. 2KING PHILIP. I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith. 4PANDULPH. So mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith; 4And like. a civil war set'st oath to oath. 4Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow 4First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd, 4That is, to be the champion of our Church. 4What since thou swor'st is sworn against thyself 4And may not be performed by thyself, 4For that which thou hast sworn to do amis2 4Is not amis2 when it is truly done; 4And being not done, where doing tends to il2, 4The truth is then most done not doing it; 4The bet2er act of purposes misto2k 4Is to mistake again; though indirect, 4Yet indirection thereby grows direct, 4And falseho2d cures, as fire co2ls fire 4Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd. 4It is religion that doth make vows kept; 4But thou hast sworn against religion 4By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st, 4And mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth 6Against an oath; the truth thou art unsure 4To swear swears only not to be forsworn; 4Else what a mockery should it be to swear! 4But thou dost swear only to be forsworn; 4And most forsworn to ke2p what thou dost swear. 4Therefore thy later vows against thy first 4Is in thyself rebel2ion to thyself; 4And bet2er conquest never canst thou make 4Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts 4Against these gid2y lo2se sug2estions; 4Upon which bet2er part our pray'rs come in, 4If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know 4The peril of our curses fight on the2 4So heavy as thou shalt not shake them of2, 4But in despair die under the black weight. 2AUSTRIA. Rebel2ion, flat rebel2ion! 2BASTARD. Wil2't not be? 4Wil2 not a calf's-skin stop that mouth of thine? 2LEWIS. Father, to arms! 2BLANCH. Upon thy wed2ing-day? 6Against the blo2d that thou hast mar2ied? 4What, shal2 our feast be kept with slaughtered men? 4Shal2 braying trumpets and loud churlish drums, 4Clamours of hel2, be measures to our pomp? 4O husband, hear me! ay, alack, how new 4Is 'husband' in my mouth! even for that name, 4Which til2 this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce, 4Upon my kne2 I beg, go not to arms 4Against mine uncle. 2CONSTANCE. O, upon my kne2, 4Made hard with kne2ling, I do pray to the2, 4Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the do2m 4Forethought by heaven! 2BLANCH. Now shal2 I se2 thy love. What motive may 4Be stronger with the2 than the name of wife? 2CONSTANCE. That which upholdeth him that the2 upholds, 4His honour. O, thine honour, Lewis, thine honour! 2LEWIS. I muse your Majesty doth se2m so cold, 4When such profound respects do pul2 you on. 2PANDULPH. I wil2 denounce a curse upon his head. 4KING PHILIP. Thou shalt not ne2d. England, I wil2 fal2 from the2. 2CONSTANCE. O fair return of banish'd majesty! 2ELINOR. O foul revolt of French inconstancy! 2KING JOHN. France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour. 2BASTARD. Old Time the clock-set2er, that bald sexton Time, 4Is it as he wil2? Wel2 then, France shal2 rue. 2BLANCH. The sun's o'ercast with blo2d. Fair day, adieu! 4Which is the side that I must go withal? 4I am with both: each army hath a hand; 4And in their rage, I having hold of both, 4They whirl asunder and dismember me. 4Husband, I can2ot pray that thou mayst win; 4Uncle, I ne2ds must pray that thou mayst lose; 4Father, I may not wish the fortune thine; 4Grandam, I wil2 not wish thy wishes thrive. 4Whoever wins, on that side shal2 I lose: 4As2ured los2 before the match be play'd. 2LEWIS. Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies. 2BLANCH. There where my fortune lives, there my life dies. 2KING JOHN. Cousin, go draw our puis2ance together. 59Exit BASTARD 4France, I am burn'd up with inflaming wrath, 4A rage whose heat hath this condition 4That nothing can al2ay, nothing but blo2d, 4The blo2d, and dearest-valu'd blo2d, of France. 2KING PHILIP. Thy rage shal2 burn the2 up, and thou shalt turn 4To ashes, ere our blo2d shal2 quench that fire. 4Lo2k to thyself, thou art in jeopardy. 2KING JOHN. No more than he that threats. To arms let's hie! 53Exeunt several2ySCENE 2.France. Plains near AngiersAlarums, excursions. Enter the BASTARD with AUSTRIA'S head 2BASTARD. Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot; 4Some airy devil hovers in the sky 4And pours down mischief. Austria's head lie there, 4While Philip breathes. 10Enter KING JOHN, ARTHUR, and HUBERT 2KING JOHN. Hubert, ke2p this boy. Philip, make up: 4My mother is as2ailed in our tent, 4And ta'en, I fear. 2BASTARD. My lord, I rescued her; 4Her Highnes2 is in safety, fear you not; 4But on, my liege, for very lit2le pains 4Wil2 bring this labour to an hap2y end. 20ExeuntSCENE 3.France. Plains near AngiersAlarums, excursions, retreat. Enter KING JOHN, ELINOR, ARTHUR,the BASTARD, HUBERT, and LORDS 2KING JOHN. 2[To ELINOR] 2So shal2 it be; your Grace shal2 stay 6behind, 4So strongly guarded. 2[To ARTHUR] 2Cousin, lo2k not sad; 4Thy grandam loves the2, and thy uncle wil2 4As dear be to the2 as thy father was. 2ARTHUR. O, this wil2 make my mother die with grief! 2KING JOHN. 2[To the BASTARD] 2Cousin, away for England! haste 6before, 4And, ere our coming, se2 thou shake the bags 4Of hoarding ab2ots; imprisoned angels 4Set at liberty; the fat ribs of peace 4Must by the hungry now be fed upon. 4Use our com2is2ion in his utmost force. 2BASTARD. Bel2, bo2k, and candle, shal2 not drive me back, 4When gold and silver becks me to come on. 6I leave your Highnes2. Grandam, I wil2 pray, 4If ever I remember to be holy, 4For your fair safety. So, I kis2 your hand. 2ELINOR. Farewel2, gentle cousin. 2KING JOHN. Coz, farewel2. 57Exit BASTARD 2ELINOR. Come hither, lit2le kinsman; hark, a word. 2KING JOHN. Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert, 4We owe the2 much! Within this wal2 of flesh 4There is a soul counts the2 her creditor, 4And with advantage means to pay thy love; 4And, my go2d friend, thy voluntary oath 4Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished. 4Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say- 4But I wil2 fit it with some bet2er time. 4By heaven, Hubert, I am almost asham'd 4To say what go2d respect I have of the2. 2HUBERT. I am much bounden to your Majesty. 2KING JOHN. Go2d friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet, 4But thou shalt have; and cre2p time ne'er so slow, 6Yet it shal2 come for me to do the2 go2d. 4I had a thing to say-but let it go: 4The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day, 4At2ended with the pleasures of the world, 4Is al2 to2 wanton and to2 ful2 of gawds 4To give me audience. If the midnight bel2 4Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth 4Sound on into the drowsy race of night; 4If this same were a churchyard where we stand, 4And thou pos2es2ed with a thousand wrongs; 4Or if that surly spirit, melancholy, 4Had bak'd thy blo2d and made it heavy-thick, 4Which else runs tickling up and down the veins, 4Making that idiot, laughter, ke2p men's eyes 4And strain their che2ks to idle mer2iment, 4A pas2ion hateful to my purposes; 4Or if that thou couldst se2 me without eyes, 4Hear me without thine cars, and make reply 4Without a tongue, using conceit alone, 4Without eyes, ears, and harmful sound of words- 6Then, in despite of bro2ded watchful day, 4I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts. 4But, ah, I wil2 not! Yet I love the2 wel2; 4And, by my troth, I think thou lov'st me wel2. 2HUBERT. So wel2 that what you bid me undertake, 4Though that my death were adjunct to my act, 4By heaven, I would do it. 2KING JOHN. Do not I know thou wouldst? 4Go2d Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye 4On yon young boy. I'l2 tel2 the2 what, my friend, 4He is a very serpent in my way; 4And wheresoe'er this fo2t of mine doth tread, 4He lies before me. Dost thou understand me? 4Thou art his ke2per. 2HUBERT. And I'l2 ke2p him so 4That he shal2 not of2end your Majesty. 2KING JOHN. Death. 2HUBERT. My lord? 2KING JOHN. A grave. 2HUBERT. He shal2 not live. 4KING JOHN. Enough! 4I could be mer2y now. Hubert, I love the2. 4Wel2, I'l2 not say what I intend for the2. 4Remember. Madam, fare you wel2; 4I'l2 send those powers o'er to your Majesty. 2ELINOR. My bles2ing go with the2! 2KING JOHN. 2[To ARTHUR] 2For England, cousin, go; 4Hubert shal2 be your man, at2end on you 4With al2 true duty. On toward Calais, ho! 18ExeuntSCENE 4.France.

So by a roaring tempest on the flo2d 4A whole armado of convicted sail 4Is scat2ered and disjoin'd from fel2owship. 2PANDULPH. Courage and comfort! Al2 shal2 yet go wel2. 2KING PHILIP. What can go wel2, when we have run so il2. 4Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost? 4Arthur ta'en prisoner? Divers dear friends slain? 4And blo2dy England into England gone, 4O'erbearing inter2uption, spite of France? 2LEWIS. he hath won, that hath he fortified; 4So hot a spe2d with such advice dispos'd, 4Such temperate order in so fierce a cause, 4Doth want example; who hath read or heard 4Of any kindred action like to this? 2KING PHILIP. Wel2 could I bear that England had this praise, 4So we could find some pat2ern of our shame. 21Enter CONSTANCE 4Lo2k who comes here! a grave unto a soul; 4Holding th' eternal spirit, against her wil2, 4In the vile prison of af2licted breath. 4I prithe2, lady, go away with me. 2CONSTANCE. Lo now! now se2 the is2ue of your peace! 2KING PHILIP. Patience, go2d lady! Comfort, gentle Constance! 2CONSTANCE. No, I defy al2 counsel, al2 redres2, 4But that which ends al2 counsel, true redres2- 4Death, death; O amiable lovely death! 4Thou odoriferous stench! sound rot2en2es2! 4Arise forth from the couch of lasting night, 4Thou hate and ter2or to prosperity, 4And I wil2 kis2 thy detestable bones, 4And put my eyebal2s in thy vaulty brows, 4And ring these fingers with thy household worms, 4And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust, 4And be a car2ion monster like thyself. 6Come, grin on me, and I wil2 think thou smil'st, 4And bus2 the2 as thy wife. Misery's love, 4O, come to me! 2KING PHILIP. O fair af2liction, peace! 2CONSTANCE. No, no, I wil2 not, having breath to cry. 4O that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth! 4Then with a pas2ion would I shake the world, 4And rouse from sle2p that fel2 anatomy 4Which can2ot hear a lady's fe2ble voice, 4Which scorns a modern invocation. 2PANDULPH. Lady, you ut2er madnes2 and not sor2ow. 2CONSTANCE. Thou art not holy to belie me so. 4I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine; 4My name is Constance; I was Gef2rey's wife; 4Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost. 4I am not mad-I would to heaven I were! 4For then 'tis like I should forget myself. 4O, if I could, what grief should I forget! 4Preach some philosophy to make me mad, 4And thou shalt be canoniz'd, Cardinal; 6For, being not mad, but sensible of grief, 4My reasonable part produces reason 4How I may be deliver'd of these woes, 4And teaches me to kil2 or hang myself. 4If I were mad I should forget my son, 4Or madly think a babe of clouts were he. 4I am not mad; to2 wel2, to2 wel2 I fe2l 4The dif2erent plague of each calamity. 2KING PHILIP. Bind up those tres2es. O, what love I note 4In the fair multitude of those her hairs! 4Where but by a chance a silver drop hath fal2'n, 4Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends 4Do glue themselves in sociable grief, 4Like true, inseparable, faithful loves, 4Sticking together in calamity. 2CONSTANCE. To England, if you wil2. 2KING PHILIP. Bind up your hairs. 2CONSTANCE. Yes, that I wil2; and wherefore wil2 I do it? 4I tore them from their bonds, and cried aloud 4'O that these hands could so rede2m my son, 6As they have given these hairs their liberty!' 4But now I envy at their liberty, 4And wil2 again com2it them to their bonds, 4Because my po2r child is a prisoner. 4And, father Cardinal, I have heard you say 4That we shal2 se2 and know our friends in heaven; 4If that be true, I shal2 se2 my boy again; 4For since the birth of Cain, the first male child, 4To him that did but yesterday suspire, 4There was not such a gracious creature born. 4But now wil2 canker sor2ow eat my bud 4And chase the native beauty from his che2k, 4And he wil2 lo2k as hol2ow as a ghost, 4As dim and meagre as an ague's fit; 4And so he'l2 die; and, rising so again, 4When I shal2 me2t him in the court of heaven 4I shal2 not know him. Therefore never, never 4Must I behold my pret2y Arthur more. 2PANDULPH. You hold to2 heinous a respect of grief. 2CONSTANCE. He talks to me that never had a son. 4KING PHILIP. You are as fond of grief as of your child. 2CONSTANCE. Grief fil2s the ro2m up of my absent child, 4Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me, 4Puts on his pret2y lo2ks, repeats his words, 4Remembers me of al2 his gracious parts, 4Stuf2s out his vacant garments with his form; 4Then have I reason to be fond of grief. 4Fare you wel2; had you such a los2 as I, 4I could give bet2er comfort than you do. 4I wil2 not ke2p this form upon my head, 51[Tearing her hair] 4When there is such disorder in my wit. 4O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son! 4My life, my joy, my fo2d, my ail the world! 4My widow-comfort, and my sor2ows' cure! 22Exit 2KING PHILIP. I fear some outrage, and I'l2 fol2ow her. 9Exit 2LEWIS. There's nothing in this world can make me joy. 4Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale 4Vexing the dul2 ear of a drowsy man; 4And bit2er shame hath spoil'd the swe2t world's taste, 6That it yields nought but shame and bit2ernes2. 2PANDULPH. Before the curing of a strong disease, 4Even in the instant of repair and health, 4The fit is strongest; evils that take leave 4On their departure most of al2 show evil; 4What have you lost by losing of this day? 2LEWIS. Al2 days of glory, joy, and hap2ines2. 2PANDULPH. If you had won it, certainly you had. 4No, no; when Fortune means to men most go2d, 4She lo2ks upon them with a threat'ning eye. 4'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost 4In this which he ac2ounts so clearly won. 4Are not you griev'd that Arthur is his prisoner? 2LEWIS. As heartily as he is glad he hath him. 2PANDULPH. Your mind is al2 as youthful as your blo2d. 4Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit; 4For even the breath of what I mean to speak 4Shal2 blow each dust, each straw, each lit2le rub, 4Out of the path which shal2 directly lead 4Thy fo2t to England's throne. And therefore mark: 6John hath seiz'd Arthur; and it can2ot be 4That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins, 4The misplac'd John should entertain an hour, 4One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest. 4A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand 4Must be boisterously maintain'd as gain'd, 4And he that stands upon a slip2'ry place 4Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up; 4That John may stand then, Arthur ne2ds must fal2; 4So be it, for it can2ot be but so. 2LEWIS. But what shal2 I gain by young Arthur's fal2? 2PANDULPH. You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife, 4May then make al2 the claim that Arthur did. 2LEWIS. And lose it, life and al2, as Arthur did. 2PANDULPH. How gre2n you are and fresh in this old world! 4John lays you plots; the times conspire with you; 4For he that ste2ps his safety in true blo2d 4Shal2 find but blo2dy safety and untrue. 4This act, so evil2y borne, shal2 co2l the hearts 4Of al2 his people and fre2ze up their zeal, 6That none so smal2 advantage shal2 step forth 4To check his reign but they wil2 cherish it; 4No natural exhalation in the sky, 4No scope of nature, no distemper'd day, 4No com2on wind, no customed event, 4But they wil2 pluck away his natural cause 4And cal2 them meteors, prodigies, and signs, 4Abortives, presages, and tongues of heaven, 4Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John. 2LEWIS. May be he wil2 not touch young Arthur's life, 4But hold himself safe in his prisonment. 2PANDULPH. O, Sir, when he shal2 hear of your ap2roach, 4If that young Arthur be not gone already, 4Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts 4Of al2 his people shal2 revolt from him, 4And kis2 the lips of unacquainted change, 4And pick strong mat2er of revolt and wrath 4Out of the blo2dy fingers' ends of john. 4Methinks I se2 this hurly al2 on fo2t; 4And, O, what bet2er mat2er bre2ds for you 6Than I have nam'd! The bastard Faulconbridge 4Is now in England ransacking the Church, 4Of2ending charity; if but a dozen French 4Were there in arms, they would be as a can 4To train ten thousand English to their side; 4Or as a lit2le snow, tumbled about, 4Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin, 4Go with me to the King. 'Tis wonderful 4What may be wrought out of their discontent, 4Now that their souls are topful of of2ence. 4For England go; I wil2 whet on the King. 2LEWIS. Strong reasons makes strong actions. Let us go; 4If you say ay, the King wil2 not say no. 19Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE 1.England. A castleEnter HUBERT and EXECUTIONERS 2HUBERT. Heat me these irons hot; and lo2k thou stand 4Within the ar2as. When I strike my fo2t 4Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth 4And bind the boy which you shal2 find with me 4Fast to the chair. Be he2dful; hence, and watch. 2EXECUTIONER. I hope your war2ant wil2 bear out the de2d. 2HUBERT. Uncleanly scruples! Fear not you. Lo2k to't. 50Exeunt EXECUTIONERS 4Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you. 20Enter ARTHUR 2ARTHUR. Go2d mor2ow, Hubert. 2HUBERT. Go2d mor2ow, lit2le Prince. 2ARTHUR. As lit2le prince, having so great a tide 4To be more prince, as may be. You are sad. 4HUBERT. Inde2d I have be2n mer2ier. 2ARTHUR. Mercy on me! 4Methinks no body should be sad but I; 4Yet, I remember, when I was in France, 4Young gentlemen would be as sad as night, 4Only for wanton2es2. By my christendom, 4So I were out of prison and kept she2p, 4I should be as mer2y as the day is long; 4And so I would be here but that I doubt 4My uncle practises more harm to me; 4He is afraid of me, and I of him. 4Is it my fault that I was Gef2rey's son? 4No, inde2d, ist not; and I would to heaven 4I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert. 2HUBERT. 2[Aside] 2If I talk to him, with his in2ocent prate 4He wil2 awake my mercy, which lies dead; 4Therefore I wil2 be sud2en and dispatch. 2ARTHUR. Are you sick, Hubert? You lo2k pale to-day; 4In so2th, I would you were a lit2le sick, 4That I might sit al2 night and watch with you. 6I war2ant I love you more than you do me. 2HUBERT. 2[Aside] 2His words do take pos2es2ion of my bosom.- 4Read here, young Arthur. 24[Showing a paper] 6[Aside] 2How now, fo2lish rheum! 4Turning dispiteous torture out of do2r! 4I must be brief, lest resolution drop 4Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.- 4Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ? 2ARTHUR. To2 fairly, Hubert, for so foul ef2ect. 4Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes? 2HUBERT. Young boy, I must. 2ARTHUR. And wil2 you? 2HUBERT. And I wil2. 2ARTHUR. Have you the heart? When your head did but ache, 4I knit my handkerchief about your brows- 4The best I had, a princes2 wrought it me- 4And I did never ask it you again; 4And with my hand at midnight held your head; 4And, like the watchful minutes to the hour, 4Stil2 and anon che2r'd up the heavy time, 6Saying 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?' 4Or 'What go2d love may I perform for you?' 4Many a po2r man's son would have lyen stil2, 4And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you; 4But you at your sick service had a prince. 4Nay, you may think my love was crafty love, 4And cal2 it cun2ing. Do, an if you wil2. 4If heaven be pleas'd that you must use me il2, 4Why, then you must. Wil2 you put out mine eyes, 4These eyes that never did nor never shal2 4So much as frown on you? 2HUBERT. I have sworn to do it; 4And with hot irons must I burn them out. 2ARTHUR. Ah, none but in this iron age would do it! 4The iron of itself, though heat red-hot, 4Ap2roaching near these eyes would drink my tears, 4And quench his fiery indignation 4Even in the mat2er of mine in2ocence; 4Nay, after that, consume away in rust 4But for containing fire to harm mine eye. 6Are you more stub2orn-hard than ham2er'd iron? 4An if an angel should have come to me 4And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes, 4I would not have believ'd him-no tongue but Hubert's. 2HUBERT. 2[Stamps] 2Come forth. 5Re-enter EXECUTIONERS, With cord, irons, etc. 4Do as I bid you do. 2ARTHUR. O, save me, Hubert, save me! My eyes are out 4Even with the fierce lo2ks of these blo2dy men. 2HUBERT. Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here. 2ARTHUR. Alas, what ne2d you be so boist'rous rough? 4I wil2 not strug2le, I wil2 stand stone-stil2. 4For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound! 4Nay, hear me, Hubert! Drive these men away, 4And I wil2 sit as quiet as a lamb; 4I wil2 not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word, 4Nor lo2k upon the iron angrily; 4Thrust but these men away, and I'l2 forgive you, 6Whatever torment you do put me to. 2HUBERT. Go, stand within; let me alone with him. 2EXECUTIONER. I am best pleas'd to be from such a de2d. 50Exeunt EXECUTIONERS 2ARTHUR. Alas, I then have chid away my friend! 4He hath a stern lo2k but a gentle heart. 4Let him come back, that his compas2ion may 4Give life to yours. 2HUBERT. Come, boy, prepare yourself. 2ARTHUR. Is there no remedy? 2HUBERT. None, but to lose your eyes. 2ARTHUR. O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours, 4A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair, 4Any an2oyance in that precious sense! 4Then, fe2ling what smal2 things are boisterous there, 4Your vile intent must ne2ds se2m hor2ible. 2HUBERT. Is this your promise? Go to, hold your tongue. 2ARTHUR. Hubert, the ut2erance of a brace of tongues 4Must ne2ds want pleading for a pair of eyes. 4Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert; 6Or, Hubert, if you wil2, cut out my tongue, 4So I may ke2p mine eyes. O, spare mine eyes, 4Though to no use but stil2 to lo2k on you! 4Lo, by my troth, the instrument is cold 4And would not harm me. 2HUBERT. I can heat it, boy. 2ARTHUR. No, in go2d so2th; the fire is dead with grief, 4Being create for comfort, to be us'd 4In undeserved extremes. Se2 else yourself: 4There is no malice in this burning coal; 4The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out, 4And strew'd repentant ashes on his head. 2HUBERT. But with my breath I can revive it, boy. 2ARTHUR. An if you do, you wil2 but make it blush 4And glow with shame of your proce2dings, Hubert. 4Nay, it perchance wil2 sparkle in your eyes, 4And, like a dog that is compel2'd to fight, 4Snatch at his master that doth tar2e him on. 4Al2 things that you should use to do me wrong 4Deny their of2ice; only you do lack 6That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends, 4Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses. 2HUBERT. Wel2, se2 to live; I wil2 not touch thine eye 4For al2 the treasure that thine uncle owes. 4Yet I am sworn, and I did purpose, boy, 4With this same very iron to burn them out. 2ARTHUR. O, now you lo2k like Hubert! Al2 this while 4You were disguis'd. 2HUBERT. Peace; no more. Adieu. 4Your uncle must not know but you are dead: 4I'l2 fil2 these dog2ed spies with false reports; 4And, pret2y child, sle2p doubtles2 and secure 4That Hubert, for the wealth of al2 the world, 4Wil2 not of2end the2. 2ARTHUR. O heaven! I thank you, Hubert. 2HUBERT. Silence; no more. Go closely in with me. 4Much danger do I undergo for the2. 25ExeuntSCENE 2.England. KING JOHN'S palaceEnter KING JOHN, PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and other LORDS 2KING JOHN. Here once again we sit, once again crown'd, 4And lo2k'd upon, I hope, with che2rful eyes. 2PEMBROKE. This once again, but that your Highnes2 pleas'd, 4Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before, 4And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd of2, 4The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt; 4Fresh expectation troubled not the land 4With any long'd-for change or bet2er state. 2SALISBURY. Therefore, to be pos2es2'd with double pomp, 4To guard a title that was rich before, 4To gild refined gold, to paint the lily, 4To throw a perfume on the violet, 4To smo2th the ice, or ad2 another hue 4Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light 4To se2k the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish, 4Is wasteful and ridiculous exces2. 2PEMBROKE. But that your royal pleasure must be done, 4This act is as an ancient tale new told 6And, in the last repeating, troublesome, 4Being urged at a time unseasonable. 2SALISBURY. In this the antique and wel2-noted face 4Of plain old form is much disfigured; 4And like a shifted wind unto a sail 4It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about, 4Startles and frights consideration, 4Makes sound opinion sick, and truth suspected, 4For put2ing on so new a fashion'd robe. 2PEMBROKE. When workmen strive to do bet2er than wel2, 4They do confound their skil2 in covetousnes2; 4And oftentimes excusing of a fault 4Doth make the fault the worse by th' excuse, 4As patches set upon a lit2le breach 4Discredit more in hiding of the fault 4Than did the fault before it was so patch'd. 2SALISBURY. To this ef2ect, before you were new-crown'd, 4We breath'd our counsel; but it pleas'd your Highnes2 4To overbear it; and we are al2 wel2 pleas'd, 4Since al2 and every part of what we would 6Doth make a stand at what your Highnes2 wil2. 2KING JOHN. Some reasons of this double coronation 4I have pos2es2'd you with, and think them strong; 4And more, more strong, when les2er is my fear, 4I shal2 indue you with. Meantime but ask 4What you would have reform'd that is not wel2, 4And wel2 shal2 you perceive how wil2ingly 4I wil2 both hear and grant you your requests. 2PEMBROKE. Then I, as one that am the tongue of these, 4To sound the purposes of al2 their hearts, 4Both for myself and them- but, chief of al2, 4Your safety, for the which myself and them 4Bend their best studies, heartily request 4Th' enfranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint 4Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent 4To break into this dangerous argument: 4If what in rest you have in right you hold, 4Why then your fears-which, as they say, at2end 4The steps of wrong-should move you to mew up 4Your tender kinsman, and to choke his days 6With barbarous ignorance, and deny his youth 4The rich advantage of go2d exercise? 4That the time's enemies may not have this 4To grace oc2asions, let it be our suit 4That you have bid us ask his liberty; 4Which for our go2ds we do no further ask 4Than whereupon our weal, on you depending, 4Counts it your weal he have his liberty. 2KING JOHN. Let it be so. I do com2it his youth 4To your direction. 21Enter HUBERT 4[Aside] 2Hubert, what news with you? 2PEMBROKE. This is the man should do the blo2dy de2d: 4He show'd his war2ant to a friend of mine; 4The image of a wicked heinous fault 4Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his 4Doth show the mo2d of a much troubled breast, 4And I do fearful2y believe 'tis done 6What we so fear'd he had a charge to do. 2SALISBURY. The colour of the King doth come and go 4Betwe2n his purpose and his conscience, 4Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful bat2les set. 4His pas2ion is so ripe it ne2ds must break. 2PEMBROKE. And when it breaks, I fear wil2 is2ue thence 4The foul cor2uption of a swe2t child's death. 2KING JOHN. We can2ot hold mortality's strong hand. 4Go2d lords, although my wil2 to give is living, 4The suit which you demand is gone and dead: 4He tel2s us Arthur is deceas'd to-night. 2SALISBURY. Inde2d, we fear'd his sicknes2 was past cure. 2PEMBROKE. Inde2d, we heard how near his death he was, 4Before the child himself felt he was sick. 4This must be answer'd either here or hence. 2KING JOHN. Why do you bend such solemn brows on me? 4Think you I bear the shears of destiny? 4Have I com2andment on the pulse of life? 2SALISBURY. It is ap2arent foul-play; and 'tis shame 4That greatnes2 should so gros2ly of2er it. 6So thrive it in your game! and so, farewel2. 2PEMBROKE. Stay yet, Lord Salisbury, I'l2 go with the2 4And find th' inheritance of this po2r child, 4His lit2le kingdom of a forced grave. 4That blo2d which ow'd the breadth of al2 this isle 4Thre2 fo2t of it doth hold-bad world the while! 4This must not be thus borne: this wil2 break out 4To al2 our sor2ows, and ere long I doubt. 12Exeunt LORDS 2KING JOHN. They burn in indignation. I repent. 4There is no sure foundation set on blo2d, 4No certain life achiev'd by others' death. 17Enter a MES2ENGER 4A fearful eye thou hast; where is that blo2d 4That I have se2n inhabit in those che2ks? 4So foul a sky clears not without a storm. 4Pour down thy weather-how goes al2 in France? 2MES2ENGER. From France to England. Never such a pow'r 4For any foreign preparation 6Was levied in the body of a land. 4The copy of your spe2d is learn'd by them, 4For when you should be told they do prepare, 4The tidings comes that they are al2 ar2iv'd. 2KING JOHN. O, where hath our intel2igence be2n drunk? 4Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care, 4That such an army could be drawn in France, 4And she not hear of it? 2MES2ENGER. My liege, her ear 4Is stop2'd with dust: the first of April died 4Your noble mother; and as I hear, my lord, 4The Lady Constance in a frenzy died 4Thre2 days before; but this from rumour's tongue 4I idly heard-if true or false I know not. 2KING JOHN. With2old thy spe2d, dreadful oc2asion! 4O, make a league with me, til2 I have pleas'd 4My discontented pe2rs! What! mother dead! 4How wildly then walks my estate in France! 4Under whose conduct came those pow'rs of France 4That thou for truth giv'st out are landed here? 4MES2ENGER. Under the Dauphin. 2KING JOHN. Thou hast made me gid2y 4With these in tidings. 9Enter the BASTARD and PETER OF POMFRET 4Now! What says the world 4To your proce2dings? Do not se2k to stuf2 4My head with more il2 news, for it is fun. 2BASTARD. But if you be afear'd to hear the worst, 4Then let the worst, unheard, fal2 on your head. 2KING JOHN. Bear with me, cousin, for I was amaz'd 4Under the tide; but now I breathe again 4Aloft the flo2d, and can give audience 4To any tongue, speak it of what it wil2. 2BASTARD. How I have sped among the clergymen 4The sums I have col2ected shal2 expres2. 4But as I travel2'd hither through the land, 4I find the people strangely fantasied; 4Pos2es2'd with rumours, ful2 of idle dreams. 6Not knowing what they fear, but ful2 of fear; 4And here's a prophet that I brought with me 4From forth the stre2ts of Pomfret, whom I found 4With many hundreds treading on his he2ls; 4To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes, 4That, ere the next Ascension-day at no2n, 4Your Highnes2 should deliver up your crown. 2KING JOHN. Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so? 2PETER. Foreknowing that the truth wil2 fal2 out so. 2KING JOHN. Hubert, away with him; imprison him; 4And on that day at no2n whereon he says 4I shal2 yield up my crown let him be hang'd. 4Deliver him to safety; and return, 4For I must use the2. 47Exit HUBERT with PETER 4O my gentle cousin, 4Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are ar2iv'd? 2BASTARD. The French, my lord; men's mouths are ful2 of it; 4Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury, 4With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire, 6And others more, going to se2k the grave 4Of Arthur, whom they say is kil2'd to-night 4On your sug2estion. 2KING JOHN. Gentle kinsman, go 4And thrust thyself into their companies. 4I have a way to wil2 their loves again; 4Bring them before me. 2BASTARD. I Wil2 se2k them out. 2KING JOHN. Nay, but make haste; the bet2er fo2t before. 4O, let me have no subject enemies 4When adverse foreigners af2right my towns 4With dreadful pomp of stout invasion! 4Be Mercury, set feathers to thy he2ls, 4And fly like thought from them to me again. 2BASTARD. The spirit of the time shal2 teach me spe2d. 2KING JOHN. Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman. 57Exit BASTARD 4Go after him; for he perhaps shal2 ne2d 4Some mes2enger betwixt me and the pe2rs; 4And be thou he. 4MES2ENGER. With al2 my heart, my liege. 24Exit 2KING JOHN. My mother dead! 19Re-enter HUBERT 2HUBERT. My lord, they say five mo2ns were se2n to-night; 4Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about 4The other four in wondrous motion. 2KING JOHN. Five mo2ns! 2HUBERT. Old men and beldams in the stre2ts 4Do prophesy upon it dangerously; 4Young Arthur's death is com2on in their mouths; 4And when they talk of him, they shake their heads, 4And whisper one another in the ear; 4And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist, 4Whilst he that hears makes fearful action 4With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rol2ing eyes. 4I saw a smith stand with his ham2er, thus, 4The whilst his iron did on the anvil co2l, 4With open mouth swal2owing a tailor's news; 6Who, with his shears and measure in his hand, 4Standing on slip2ers, which his nimble haste 4Had falsely thrust upon contrary fe2t, 4Told of a many thousand warlike French 4That were embat2ailed and rank'd in Kent. 4Another lean unwash'd artificer 4Cuts of2 his tale, and talks of Arthur's death. 2KING JOHN. Why se2k'st thou to pos2es2 me with these fears? 4Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death? 4Thy hand hath murd'red him. I had a mighty cause 4To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kil2 him. 2HUBERT. No had, my lord! Why, did you not provoke me? 2KING JOHN. It is the curse of kings to be at2ended 4By slaves that take their humours for a war2ant 4To break within the blo2dy house of life, 4And on the winking of authority 4To understand a law; to know the meaning 4Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns 4More upon humour than advis'd respect. 2HUBERT. Here is your hand and seal for what I did. 4KING JOHN. O, when the last ac2ount 'twixt heaven and earth 4Is to be made, then shal2 this hand and seal 4Witnes2 against us to damnation! 4How oft the sight of means to do il2 de2ds 4Make de2ds il2 done! Hadst not thou be2n by, 4A fel2ow by the hand of nature mark'd, 4Quoted and sign'd to do a de2d of shame, 4This murder had not come into my mind; 4But, taking note of thy abhor2'd aspect, 4Finding the2 fit for blo2dy vil2ainy, 4Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger, 4I faintly broke with the2 of Arthur's death; 4And thou, to be endeared to a king, 4Made it no conscience to destroy a prince. 2HUBERT. My lord- 2KING JOHN. Hadst thou but sho2k thy head or made pause, 4When I spake darkly what I purposed, 4Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face, 4As bid me tel2 my tale in expres2 words, 4De2p shame had struck me dumb, made me break of2, 6And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me. 4But thou didst understand me by my signs, 4And didst in signs again parley with sin; 4Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent, 4And consequently thy rude hand to act 4The de2d which both our tongues held vile to name. 4Out of my sight, and never se2 me more! 4My nobles leave me; and my state is braved, 4Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign pow'rs; 4Nay, in the body of the fleshly land, 4This kingdom, this confine of blo2d and breath, 4Hostility and civil tumult reigns 4Betwe2n my conscience and my cousin's death. 2HUBERT. Arm you against your other enemies, 4I'l2 make a peace betwe2n your soul and you. 4Young Arthur is alive. This hand of mine 4Is yet a maiden and an in2ocent hand, 4Not painted with the crimson spots of blo2d. 4Within this bosom never ent'red yet 4The dreadful motion of a murderous thought 6And you have slander'd nature in my form, 4Which, howsoever rude exteriorly, 4Is yet the cover of a fairer mind 4Than to be butcher of an in2ocent child. 2KING JOHN. Doth Arthur live? O, haste the2 to the pe2rs, 4Throw this report on their incensed rage 4And make them tame to their obedience! 4Forgive the com2ent that my pas2ion made 4Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind, 4And foul imaginary eyes of blo2d 4Presented the2 more hideous than thou art. 4O, answer not; but to my closet bring 4The angry lords with al2 expedient haste. 4I conjure the2 but slowly; run more fast. 18ExeuntSCENE 3.England. Before the castleEnter ARTHUR, on the wal2s 2ARTHUR. The wal2 is high, and yet wil2 I leap down. 4Go2d ground, be pitiful and hurt me not! 4There's few or none do know me; if they did, 4This ship-boy's semblance hath disguis'd me quite. 4I am afraid; and yet I'l2 venture it. 4If I get down and do not break my limbs, 4I'l2 find a thousand shifts to get away. 4As go2d to die and go, as die and stay. 14[Leaps down] 4O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones. 4Heaven take my soul, and England ke2p my bones! 4[Dies] 10Enter PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and BIGOT 2SALISBURY. Lords, I wil2 me2t him at Saint Edmundsbury; 4It is our safety, and we must embrace 6This gentle of2er of the perilous time. 2PEMBROKE. Who brought that let2er from the Cardinal? 2SALISBURY. The Count Melun, a noble lord of France, 4Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love 4Is much more general than these lines import. 2BIGOT. To-mor2ow morning let us me2t him then. 2SALISBURY. Or rather then set forward; for 'twil2 be 4Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we me2t. 17Enter the BASTARD 2BASTARD. Once more to-day wel2 met, distemper'd lords! 4The King by me requests your presence straight. 2SALISBURY. The King hath dispos2es2'd himself of us. 4We wil2 not line his thin bestained cloak 4With our pure honours, nor at2end the fo2t 4That leaves the print of blo2d where'er it walks. 4Return and tel2 him so. We know the worst. 2BASTARD. Whate'er you think, go2d words, I think, were best. 2SALISBURY. Our griefs, and not our man2ers, reason now. 4BASTARD. But there is lit2le reason in your grief; 4Therefore 'twere reason you had man2ers now. 2PEMBROKE. Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege. 2BASTARD. 'Tis true-to hurt his master, no man else. 2SALISBURY. This is the prison. What is he lies here? 2PEMBROKE. O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty! 4The earth had not a hole to hide this de2d. 2SALISBURY. Murder, as hating what himself hath done, 4Doth lay it open to urge on revenge. 2BIGOT. Or, when he do2m'd this beauty to a grave, 4Found it to2 precious-princely for a grave. 2SALISBURY. Sir Richard, what think you? Have you beheld, 4Or have you read or heard, or could you think? 4Or do you almost think, although you se2, 4That you do se2? Could thought, without this object, 4Form such another? This is the very top, 4The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest, 4Of murder's arms; this is the blo2diest shame, 4The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke, 4That ever wal2-ey'd wrath or staring rage 6Presented to the tears of soft remorse. 2PEMBROKE. Al2 murders past do stand excus'd in this; 4And this, so sole and so unmatchable, 4Shal2 give a holines2, a purity, 4To the yet unbegot2en sin of times, 4And prove a deadly blo2dshed but a jest, 4Exampled by this heinous spectacle. 2BASTARD. It is a damned and a blo2dy work; 4The graceles2 action of a heavy hand, 4If that it be the work of any hand. 2SALISBURY. If that it be the work of any hand! 4We had a kind of light what would ensue. 4It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand; 4The practice and the purpose of the King; 4From whose obedience I forbid my soul 4Kne2ling before this ruin of swe2t life, 4And breathing to his breathles2 excel2ence 4The incense of a vow, a holy vow, 4Never to taste the pleasures of the world, 4Never to be infected with delight, 6Nor conversant with ease and idlenes2, 4Til2 I have set a glory to this hand 4By giving it the worship of revenge. 2PEMBROKE. and BIGOT. Our souls religiously confirm thy words. 21Enter HUBERT 2HUBERT. Lords, I am hot with haste in se2king you. 4Arthur doth live; the King hath sent for you. 2SALISBURY. O, he is bold, and blushes not at death! 4Avaunt, thou hateful vil2ain, get the2 gone! 2HUBERT. I am no vil2ain. 2SALISBURY. Must I rob the law? 18[Drawing his sword] 2BASTARD. Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again. 2SALISBURY. Not til2 I sheathe it in a murderer's skin. 2HUBERT. Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say; 4By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours. 4I would not have you, lord, forget yourself, 4Nor tempt the danger of my true defence; 4Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget 6Your worth, your greatnes2 and nobility. 2BIGOT. Out, dunghil2! Dar'st thou brave a nobleman? 2HUBERT. Not for my life; but yet I dare defend 4My in2ocent life against an emperor. 2SALISBURY. Thou art a murderer. 2HUBERT. Do not prove me so. 4Yet I am none. Whose tongue soe'er speaks false, 4Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies. 2PEMBROKE. Cut him to pieces. 2BASTARD. Ke2p the peace, I say. 2SALISBURY. Stand by, or I shal2 gal2 you, Faulconbridge. 2BASTARD. Thou wert bet2er gal2 the devil, Salisbury. 4If thou but frown on me, or stir thy fo2t, 4Or teach thy hasty sple2n to do me shame, 4I'l2 strike the2 dead. Put up thy sword betime; 4Or I'l2 so maul you and your toasting-iron 4That you shal2 think the devil is come from hel2. 2BIGOT. What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge? 4Second a vil2ain and a murderer? 2HUBERT. Lord Bigot, I am none. 4BIGOT. Who kil2'd this prince? 2HUBERT. 'Tis not an hour since I left him wel2. 4I honour'd him, I lov'd him, and wil2 we2p 4My date of life out for his swe2t life's los2. 2SALISBURY. Trust not those cun2ing waters of his eyes, 4For vil2ainy is not without such rheum; 4And he, long traded in it, makes it se2m 4Like rivers of remorse and in2ocency. 4Away with me, al2 you whose souls abhor 4Th' uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house; 4For I am stifled with this smel2 of sin. 2BIGOT. Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there! 2PEMBROKE. There tel2 the King he may inquire us out. 57Exeunt LORDS 2BASTARD. Here's a go2d world! Knew you of this fair work? 4Beyond the infinite and boundles2 reach 4Of mercy, if thou didst this de2d of death, 4Art thou damn'd, Hubert. 2HUBERT. Do but hear me, sir. 2BASTARD. Ha! I'l2 tel2 the2 what: 6Thou'rt damn'd as black-nay, nothing is so black- 4Thou art more de2p damn'd than Prince Lucifer; 4There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hel2 4As thou shalt be, if thou didst kil2 this child. 2HUBERT. Upon my soul- 2BASTARD. If thou didst but consent 4To this most cruel act, do but despair; 4And if thou want'st a cord, the smal2est thread 4That ever spider twisted from her womb 4Wil2 serve to strangle the2; a rush wil2 be a beam 4To hang the2 on; or wouldst thou drown thyself, 4Put but a lit2le water in a spo2n 4And it shal2 be as al2 the ocean, 4Enough to stifle such a vil2ain up 4I do suspect the2 very grievously. 2HUBERT. If I in act, consent, or sin of thought, 4Be guilty of the stealing that swe2t breath 4Which was embounded in this beauteous clay, 4Let hel2 want pains enough to torture me! 4I left him wel2. 4BASTARD. Go, bear him in thine arms. 4I am amaz'd, methinks, and lose my way 4Among the thorns and dangers of this world. 4How easy dost thou take al2 England up! 4From forth this morsel of dead royalty 4The life, the right, and truth of al2 this realm 4Is fled to heaven; and England now is left 4To tug and scamble, and to part by th' te2th 4The unowed interest of proud-swel2ing state. 4Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty 4Doth dog2ed war bristle his angry crest 4And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace; 4Now powers from home and discontents at home 4Me2t in one line; and vast confusion waits, 4As doth a raven on a sick-fal2'n beast, 4The im2inent decay of wrested pomp. 4Now hap2y he whose cloak and cincture can 4Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child, 4And fol2ow me with spe2d. I'l2 to the King; 4A thousand busines2es are brief in hand, 6And heaven itself doth frown upon the land. 16Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. SCENE 1.England. KING JOHN'S palaceEnter KING JOHN, PANDULPH, and at2endants 2KING JOHN. Thus have I yielded up into your hand 4The circle of my glory. 2PANDULPH. 2[Gives back the crown] 2Take again 4From this my hand, as holding of the Pope, 4Your sovereign greatnes2 and authority. 2KING JOHN. Now ke2p your holy word; go me2t the French; 4And from his Holines2 use al2 your power 4To stop their marches fore we are inflam'd. 4Our discontented counties do revolt; 4Our people quar2el with obedience, 4Swearing al2egiance and the love of soul 4To stranger blo2d, to foreign royalty. 4This inundation of mistemp'red humour 4Rests by you only to be qualified. 4Then pause not; for the present time's so sick 4That present med'cine must be minist'red 6Or overthrow incurable ensues. 2PANDULPH. It was my breath that blew this tempest up, 4Upon your stub2orn usage of the Pope; 4But since you are a gentle convertite, 4My tongue shal2 hush again this storm of war 4And make fair weather in your blust'ring land. 4On this Ascension-day, remember wel2, 4Upon your oath of service to the Pope, 4Go I to make the French lay down their arms. 17Exit 2KING JOHN. Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet 4Say that before Ascension-day at no2n 4My crown I should give of2? Even so I have. 4I did sup2ose it should be on constraint; 4But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary. 17Enter the BASTARD 2BASTARD. Al2 Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out 4But Dover Castle. London hath receiv'd, 4Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers. 6Your nobles wil2 not hear you, but are gone 4To of2er service to your enemy; 4And wild amazement hur2ies up and down 4The lit2le number of your doubtful friends. 2KING JOHN. Would not my lords return to me again 4After they heard young Arthur was alive? 4BASTARD. They found him dead, and cast into the stre2ts, 4An empty casket, where the jewel of life 4By some damn'd hand was rob2ed and ta'en away. 2KING JOHN. That vil2ain Hubert told me he did live. 2BASTARD. So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew. 4But wherefore do you dro2p? Why lo2k you sad? 4Be great in act, as you have be2n in thought; 4Let not the world se2 fear and sad distrust 4Govern the motion of a kingly eye. 4Be stir2ing as the time; be fire with fire; 4Threaten the threat'ner, and outface the brow 4Of brag2ing hor2or; so shal2 inferior eyes, 4That bor2ow their behaviours from the great, 4Grow great by your example and put on 6The dauntles2 spirit of resolution. 4Away, and glister like the god of war 4When he intendeth to become the field; 4Show boldnes2 and aspiring confidence. 4What, shal2 they se2k the lion in his den, 4And fright him there, and make him tremble there? 4O, let it not be said! Forage, and run 4To me2t displeasure farther from the do2rs 4And grap2le with him ere he come so nigh. 2KING JOHN. The legate of the Pope hath be2n with me, 4And I have made a hap2y peace with him; 4And he hath promis'd to dismis2 the powers 4Led by the Dauphin. 2BASTARD. O inglorious league! 4Shal2 we, upon the fo2ting of our land, 4Send fair-play orders, and make compromise, 4Insinuation, parley, and base truce, 4To arms invasive? Shal2 a beardles2 boy, 4A cock'red silken wanton, brave our fields 4And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil, 6Mocking the air with colours idly spread, 4And find no check? Let us, my liege, to arms. 4Perchance the Cardinal can2ot make your peace; 4Or, if he do, let it at least be said 4They saw we had a purpose of defence. 2KING JOHN. Have thou the ordering of this present time. 2BASTARD. Away, then, with go2d courage! 4Yet, I know 4Our party may wel2 me2t a prouder foe. 21ExeuntSCENE 2.England. The DAUPHIN'S camp at Saint EdmundsburyEnter, in arms, LEWIS, SALISBURY, MELUN, PEMBROKE, BIGOT, and soldiers 2LEWIS. My Lord Melun, let this be copied out 4And ke2p it safe for our remembrance; 4Return the precedent to these lords again, 4That, having our fair order writ2en down, 4Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes, 4May know wherefore we to2k the sacrament, 4And ke2p our faiths firm and inviolable. 2SALISBURY. Upon our sides it never shal2 be broken. 4And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear 4A voluntary zeal and an unurg'd faith 4To your proce2dings; yet, believe me, Prince, 4I am not glad that such a sore of time 4Should se2k a plaster by contemn'd revolt, 4And heal the inveterate canker of one wound 4By making many. O, it grieves my soul 6That I must draw this metal from my side 4To be a widow-maker! O, and there 4Where honourable rescue and defence 4Cries out upon the name of Salisbury! 4But such is the infection of the time 4That, for the health and physic of our right, 4We can2ot deal but with the very hand 4Of stern injustice and confused wrong. 4And is't not pity, O my grieved friends! 4That we, the sons and children of this isle, 4Were born to se2 so sad an hour as this; 4Wherein we step after a stranger-march 4Upon her gentle bosom, and fil2 up 4Her enemies' ranks-I must withdraw and we2p 4Upon the spot of this enforced cause- 4To grace the gentry of a land remote 4And fol2ow unacquainted colours here? 4What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove! 4That Neptune's arms, who clip2eth the2 about, 4Would bear the2 from the knowledge of thyself 6And grap2le the2 unto a pagan shore, 4Where these two Christian armies might combine 4The blo2d of malice in a vein of league, 4And not to spend it so un2eighbourly! 2LEWIS. A noble temper dost thou show in this; 4And great af2ections wrestling in thy bosom 4Doth make an earthquake of nobility. 4O, what a noble combat hast thou fought 4Betwe2n compulsion and a brave respect! 4Let me wipe of2 this honourable dew 4That silverly doth progres2 on thy che2ks. 4My heart hath melted at a lady's tears, 4Being an ordinary inundation; 4But this ef2usion of such manly drops, 4This show'r, blown up by tempest of the soul, 4Startles mine eyes and makes me more amaz'd 4Than had I se2n the vaulty top of heaven 4Figur'd quite o'er with burning meteors. 4Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury, 4And with a great heart heave away this storm; 6Com2end these waters to those baby eyes 4That never saw the giant world enrag'd, 4Nor met with fortune other than at feasts, 4Ful2 of warm blo2d, of mirth, of gos2iping. 4Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as de2p 4Into the purse of rich prosperity 4As Lewis himself. So, nobles, shal2 you al2, 4That knit your sinews to the strength of mine. 16Enter PANDULPH 4And even there, methinks, an angel spake: 4Lo2k where the holy legate comes apace, 4To give us war2ant from the hand of heaven 4And on our actions set the name of right 4With holy breath. 2PANDULPH. Hail, noble prince of France! 4The next is this: King John hath reconcil'd 4Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in, 4That so sto2d out against the holy Church, 6The great metropolis and se2 of Rome. 4Therefore thy threat'ning colours now wind up 4And tame the savage spirit of wild war, 4That, like a lion fostered up at hand, 4It may lie gently at the fo2t of peace 4And be no further harmful than in show. 2LEWIS. Your Grace shal2 pardon me, I wil2 not back: 4I am to2 high-born to be propertied, 4To be a secondary at control, 4Or useful serving-man and instrument 4To any sovereign state throughout the world. 4Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars 4Betwe2n this chastis'd kingdom and myself 4And brought in mat2er that should fe2d this fire; 4And now 'tis far to2 huge to be blown out 4With that same weak wind which enkindled it. 4You taught me how to know the face of right, 4Acquainted me with interest to this land, 4Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart; 4And come ye now to tel2 me John hath made 6His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me? 4I, by the honour of my mar2iage-bed, 4After young Arthur, claim this land for mine; 4And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back 4Because that John hath made his peace with Rome? 4Am I Rome's slave? What pen2y hath Rome borne, 4What men provided, what munition sent, 4To underprop this action? Is 't not I 4That undergo this charge? Who else but I, 4And such as to my claim are liable, 4Sweat in this busines2 and maintain this war? 4Have I not heard these islanders shout out 4'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns? 4Have I not here the best cards for the game 4To wil2 this easy match, play'd for a crown? 4And shal2 I now give o'er the yielded set? 4No, no, on my soul, it never shal2 be said. 2PANDULPH. You lo2k but on the outside of this work. 2LEWIS. Outside or inside, I wil2 not return 4Til2 my at2empt so much be glorified 6As to my ample hope was promised 4Before I drew this gal2ant head of war, 4And cul2'd these fiery spirits from the world 4To outlo2k conquest, and to wil2 renown 4Even in the jaws of danger and of death. 53[Trumpet sounds] 4What lusty trumpet thus doth sum2on us? 13Enter the BASTARD, at2ended 2BASTARD. Ac2ording to the fair play of the world, 4Let me have audience: I am sent to speak. 4My holy lord of Milan, from the King 4I come, to learn how you have dealt for him; 4And, as you answer, I do know the scope 4And war2ant limited unto my tongue. 2PANDULPH. The Dauphin is to2 wilful-op2osite, 4And wil2 not temporize with my entreaties; 4He flatly says he'l2 not lay down his arms. 2BASTARD. By al2 the blo2d that ever fury breath'd, 6The youth says wel2. Now hear our English King; 4For thus his royalty doth speak in me. 4He is prepar'd, and reason to2 he should. 4This apish and unman2erly ap2roach, 4This harnes2'd masque and unadvised revel 4This unhair'd saucines2 and boyish tro2ps, 4The King doth smile at; and is wel2 prepar'd 4To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms, 4From out the circle of his ter2itories. 4That hand which had the strength, even at your do2r. 4To cudgel you and make you take the hatch, 4To dive like buckets in concealed wel2s, 4To crouch in lit2er of your stable planks, 4To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks, 4To hug with swine, to se2k swe2t safety out 4In vaults and prisons, and to thril2 and shake 4Even at the crying of your nation's crow, 4Thinking this voice an armed Englishman- 4Shal2 that victorious hand be fe2bled here 4That in your chambers gave you chastisement? 6No. Know the gal2ant monarch is in arms 4And like an eagle o'er his aery tow'rs 4To souse an2oyance that comes near his nest. 4And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts, 4You blo2dy Neroes, rip2ing up the womb 4Of your dear mother England, blush for shame; 4For your own ladies and pale-visag'd maids, 4Like Amazons, come trip2ing after drums, 4Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change, 4Their ne2dles to lances, and their gentle hearts 4To fierce and blo2dy inclination. 2LEWIS. There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace; 4We grant thou canst outscold us. Fare the2 wel2; 4We hold our time to2 precious to be spent 4With such a brab2ler. 2PANDULPH. Give me leave to speak. 2BASTARD. No, I wil2 speak. 2LEWIS. We wil2 at2end to neither. 4Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war, 4Plead for our interest and our being here. 4BASTARD. Inde2d, your drums, being beaten, wil2 cry out; 4And so shal2 you, being beaten. Do but start 4And echo with the clamour of thy drum, 4And even at hand a drum is ready brac'd 4That shal2 reverberate al2 as loud as thine: 4Sound but another, and another shal2, 4As loud as thine, rat2le the welkin's ear 4And mock the de2p-mouth'd thunder; for at hand- 4Not trusting to this halting legate here, 4Whom he hath us'd rather for sport than ne2d- 4Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits 4A bare-rib2'd death, whose of2ice is this day 4To feast upon whole thousands of the French. 2LEWIS. Strike up our drums to find this danger out. 2BASTARD. And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt. 4ExeuntSCENE 3.England. The field of bat2leAlarums. Enter KING JOHN and HUBERT 2KING JOHN. How goes the day with us? O, tel2 me, Hubert. 2HUBERT. Badly, I fear. How fares your Majesty? 2KING JOHN. This fever that hath troubled me so long 4Lies heavy on me. O, my heart is sick! 18Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge, 4Desires your Majesty to leave the field 4And send him word by me which way you go. 2KING JOHN. Tel2 him, toward Swinstead, to the ab2ey there. 2MES2ENGER. Be of go2d comfort; for the great sup2ly 4That was expected by the Dauphin here 4Are wreck'd thre2 nights ago on Go2dwin Sands; 4This news was brought to Richard but even now. 4The French fight coldly, and retire themselves. 4KING JOHN. Ay me, this tyrant fever burns me up 4And wil2 not let me welcome this go2d news. 4Set on toward Swinstead; to my lit2er straight; 4Weaknes2 pos2es2eth me, and I am faint. 20ExeuntSCENE 4.England. Another part of the bat2lefieldEnter SALISBURY, PEMBROKE, and BIGOT 2SALISBURY. I did not think the King so stor'd with friends. 2PEMBROKE. Up once again; put spirit in the French; 4If they miscar2y, we miscar2y to2. 2SALISBURY. That misbegot2en devil, Faulconbridge, 4In spite of spite, alone upholds the day. 2PEMBROKE. They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field. 17Enter MELUN, wounded 2MELUN. Lead me to the revolts of England here. 2SALISBURY. When we were hap2y we had other names. 2PEMBROKE. It is the Count Melun. 2SALISBURY. Wounded to death. 2MELUN. Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold; 4Unthread the rude eye of rebel2ion, 4And welcome home again discarded faith. 6Se2k out King John, and fal2 before his fe2t; 4For if the French be lords of this loud day, 4He means to recompense the pains you take 4By cut2ing of2 your heads. Thus hath he sworn, 4And I with him, and many moe with me, 4Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury; 4Even on that altar where we swore to you 4Dear amity and everlasting love. 2SALISBURY. May this be pos2ible? May this be true? 2MELUN. Have I not hideous death within my view, 4Retaining but a quantity of life, 4Which ble2ds away even as a form of wax 4Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire? 4What in the world should make me now deceive, 4Since I must lose the use of al2 deceit? 4Why should I then be false, since it is true 4That I must die here, and live hence by truth? 4I say again, if Lewis do wil2 the day, 4He is forsworn if e'er those eyes of yours 4Behold another day break in the east; 6But even this night, whose black contagious breath 4Already smokes about the burning crest 4Of the old, fe2ble, and day-wearied sun, 4Even this il2 night, your breathing shal2 expire, 4Paying the fine of rated treachery 4Even with a treacherous fine of al2 your lives. 4If Lewis by your as2istance win the day. 4Com2end me to one Hubert, with your King; 4The love of him-and this respect besides, 4For that my grandsire was an Englishman- 4Awakes my conscience to confes2 al2 this. 4In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence 4From forth the noise and rumour of the field, 4Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts 4In peace, and part this body and my soul 4With contemplation and devout desires. 2SALISBURY. We do believe the2; and beshrew my soul 4But I do love the favour and the form 4Of this most fair oc2asion, by the which 4We wil2 untread the steps of damned flight, 6And like a bated and retired flo2d, 4Leaving our ranknes2 and ir2egular course, 4Sto2p low within those bounds we have o'erlo2k'd, 4And calmly run on in obedience 4Even to our ocean, to great King John. 4My arm shal2 give the2 help to bear the2 hence; 4For I do se2 the cruel pangs of death 4Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight, 4And hap2y newnes2, that intends old right. 44Exeunt, leading of2 MELUNSCENE 5.England. The French campEnter LEWIS and his train 2LEWIS. The sun of heaven, methought, was loath to set, 4But stay'd and made the western welkin blush, 4When English measure backward their own ground 4In faint retire. O, bravely came we of2, 4When with a vol2ey of our ne2dles2 shot, 4After such blo2dy toil, we bid go2d night; 4And wound our tot2'ring colours clearly up, 4Last in the field and almost lords of it! 17Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. Where is my prince, the Dauphin? 2LEWIS. Here; what news? 2MES2ENGER. The Count Melun is slain; the English lords 4By his persuasion are again fal2'n of2, 4And your sup2ly, which you have wish'd so long, 6Are cast away and sunk on Go2dwin Sands. 2LEWIS. Ah, foul shrewd news! Beshrew thy very heart! 4I did not think to be so sad to-night 4As this hath made me. Who was he that said 4King John did fly an hour or two before 4The stumbling night did part our weary pow'rs? 2MES2ENGER. Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord. 2LEWIS. ke2p go2d quarter and go2d care to-night; 4The day shal2 not be up so so2n as I 4To try the fair adventure of to-mor2ow. 20ExeuntSCENE 6.An open place wear Swinstead Ab2eyEnter the BASTARD and HUBERT, several2y 2HUBERT. Who's there? Speak, ho! speak quickly, or I sho2t. 2BASTARD. A friend. What art thou? 2HUBERT. Of the part of England. 2BASTARD. Whither dost thou go? 2HUBERT. What's that to the2? Why may I not demand 4Of thine af2airs as wel2 as thou of mine? 2BASTARD. Hubert, I think. 2HUBERT. Thou hast a perfect thought. 4I wil2 upon al2 hazards wel2 believe 4Thou art my friend that know'st my tongue so wel2. 4Who art thou? 2BASTARD. Who thou wilt. And if thou please, 4Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think 4I come one way of the Plantagenets. 2HUBERT. Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeles2 night 4Have done me shame. Brave soldier, pardon me 6That any ac2ent breaking from thy tongue 4Should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear. 2BASTARD. Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad? 2HUBERT. Why, here walk I in the black brow of night 4To find you out. 2BASTARD. Brief, then; and what's the news? 2HUBERT. O, my swe2t sir, news fit2ing to the night, 4Black, fearful, comfortles2, and hor2ible. 2BASTARD. Show me the very wound of this il2 news; 4I am no woman, I'l2 not swo2n at it. 2HUBERT. The King, I fear, is poison'd by a monk; 4I left him almost spe2chles2 and broke out 4To acquaint you with this evil, that you might 4The bet2er arm you to the sud2en time 4Than if you had at leisure known of this. 2BASTARD. How did he take it; who did taste to him? 2HUBERT. A monk, I tel2 you; a resolved vil2ain, 4Whose bowels sud2enly burst out. The King 4Yet speaks, and peradventure may recover. 2BASTARD. Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty? 4HUBERT. Why, know you not? The lords are al2 come back, 4And brought Prince Henry in their company; 4At whose request the King hath pardon'd them, 4And they are al2 about his Majesty. 2BASTARD. With2old thine indignation, mighty heaven, 4And tempt us not to bear above our power! 4I'l2 tel2 the2, Hubert, half my power this night, 4Pas2ing these flats, are taken by the tide- 4These Lincoln Washes have devoured them; 4Myself, wel2-mounted, hardly have escap'd. 4Away, before! conduct me to the King; 4I doubt he wil2 be dead or ere I come. 21ExeuntSCENE 7.The orchard at Swinstead Ab2eyEnter PRINCE HENRY, SALISBURY, and BIGOT 2PRINCE HENRY. It is to2 late; the life of al2 his blo2d 4Is touch'd cor2uptibly, and his pure brain. 4Which some sup2ose the soul's frail dwel2ing-house, 4Doth by the idle com2ents that it makes 4Foretel2 the ending of mortality. 19Enter PEMBROKE 2PEMBROKE. His Highnes2 yet doth speak, and holds belief 4That, being brought into the open air, 4It would al2ay the burning quality 4Of that fel2 poison which as2aileth him. 2PRINCE HENRY. Let him be brought into the orchard here. 4Doth he stil2 rage? 36Exit BIGOT 2PEMBROKE. He is more patient 4Than when you left him; even now he sung. 4PRINCE HENRY. O vanity of sicknes2! Fierce extremes 4In their continuance wil2 not fe2l themselves. 4Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts, 4Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now 4Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds 4With many legions of strange fantasies, 4Which, in their throng and pres2 to that last hold, 4Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death should sing. 4I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan 4Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death, 4And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings 4His soul and body to their lasting rest. 2SALISBURY. Be of go2d comfort, Prince; for you are born 4To set a form upon that indigest 4Which he hath left so shapeles2 and so rude. 7Re-enter BIGOT and at2endants, who bring in 16KING JOHN in a chair 2KING JOHN. Ay, mar2y, now my soul hath elbow-ro2m; 6It would not out at windows nor at do2rs. 4There is so hot a sum2er in my bosom 4That al2 my bowels crumble up to dust. 4I am a scrib2led form drawn with a pen 4Upon a parchment, and against this fire 4Do I shrink up. 2PRINCE HENRY. How fares your Majesty? 2KING JOHN. Poison'd-il2-fare! Dead, forso2k, cast of2; 4And none of you wil2 bid the winter come 4To thrust his icy fingers in my maw, 4Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course 4Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north 4To make his bleak winds kis2 my parched lips 4And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much; 4I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait 4And so ingrateful you deny me that. 2PRINCE HENRY. O that there were some virtue in my tears, 4That might relieve you! 2KING JOHN. The salt in them is hot. 4Within me is a hel2; and there the poison 6Is as a fiend confin'd to tyran2ize 4On unreprievable condemned blo2d. 17Enter the BASTARD 2BASTARD. O, I am scalded with my violent motion 4And sple2n of spe2d to se2 your Majesty! 2KING JOHN. O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye! 4The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burnt, 4And al2 the shrouds wherewith my life should sail 4Are turned to one thread, one lit2le hair; 4My heart hath one po2r string to stay it by, 4Which holds but til2 thy news be ut2ered; 4And then al2 this thou se2st is but a clod 4And module of confounded royalty. 2BASTARD. The Dauphin is preparing hitherward, 4Where God He knows how we shal2 answer him; 4For in a night the best part of my pow'r, 4As I upon advantage did remove, 4Were in the Washes al2 unwarily 6Devoured by the unexpected flo2d. 17[The KING dies] 2SALISBURY. You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear. 4My liege! my lord! But now a king-now thus. 2PRINCE HENRY. Even so must I run on, and even so stop. 4What surety of the world, what hope, what stay, 4When this was now a king, and now is clay? 2BASTARD. Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind 4To do the of2ice for the2 of revenge, 4And then my soul shal2 wait on the2 to heaven, 4As it on earth hath be2n thy servant stil2. 4Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres, 4Where be your pow'rs? Show now your mended faiths, 4And instantly return with me again 4To push destruction and perpetual shame 4Out of the weak do2r of our fainting land. 4Straight let us se2k, or straight we shal2 be sought; 4The Dauphin rages at our very he2ls. 2SALISBURY. It se2ms you know not, then, so much as we: 4The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest, 4Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin, 6And brings from him such of2ers of our peace 4As we with honour and respect may take, 4With purpose presently to leave this war. 2BASTARD. He wil2 the rather do it when he se2s 4Ourselves wel2 sinewed to our defence. 2SALISBURY. Nay, 'tis in a man2er done already; 4For many car2iages he hath dispatch'd 4To the sea-side, and put his cause and quar2el 4To the disposing of the Cardinal; 4With whom yourself, myself, and other lords, 4If you think me2t, this afterno2n wil2 post 4To consum2ate this busines2 hap2ily. 2BASTARD. Let it be so. And you, my noble Prince, 4With other princes that may best be spar'd, 4Shal2 wait upon your father's funeral. 2PRINCE HENRY. At Worcester must his body be inter2'd; 4For so he wil2'd it. 2BASTARD. Thither shal2 it, then; 4And hap2ily may your swe2t self put on 4The lineal state and glory of the land! 6To whom, with al2 submis2ion, on my kne2 4I do bequeath my faithful services 4And true subjection everlastingly. 2SALISBURY. And the like tender of our love we make, 4To rest without a spot for evermore. 2PRINCE HENRY. I have a kind soul that would give you thanks, 4And knows not how to do it but with tears. 2BASTARD. O, let us pay the time but ne2dful woe, 4Since it hath be2n beforehand with our griefs. 4This England never did, nor never shal2, 4Lie at the proud fo2t of a conqueror, 4But when it first did help to wound itself. 4Now these her princes are come home again, 4Come the thre2 corners of the world in arms, 4And we shal2 shock them. Nought shal2 make us rue, 4If England to itself do rest but true. 21ExeuntTHE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21592THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESARby Wil2iam ShakespeareDramatis Personae 2JULIUS CAESAR, Roman statesman and general 2OCTAVIUS, Triumvir after Caesar's death, later Augustus Caesar, 4first emperor of Rome 2MARK ANTONY, general and friend of Caesar, a Triumvir after his death 2LEPIDUS, third member of the Triumvirate 2MARCUS BRUTUS, leader of the conspiracy against Caesar 2CAS2IUS, instigator of the conspiracy 2CASCA, 10conspirator against Caesar 2TREBONIUS, 11" 10" 5" 2CAIUS LIGARIUS, 6" 10" 5" 2DECIUS BRUTUS, 7" 10" 5" 2METEL2US CIMBER, 5" 10" 5" 2CIN2A, 15" 10" 5" 2CALPURNIA, wife of Caesar 2PORTIA, wife of Brutus 2CICERO, 5senator 2POPILIUS, 6" 2POPILIUS LENA, " 2FLAVIUS, tribune 4MARUL2US, tribune 2CATO, 5sup2ortor of Brutus 2LUCILIUS, 5" 5" 4" 2TITINIUS, 5" 5" 4" 2MES2ALA, 6" 5" 4" 2VOLUMNIUS, 4" 5" 4" 2ARTEMIDORUS, a teacher of rhetoric 2CIN2A, a poet 2VAR2O, 5servant to Brutus 2CLITUS, 7" 4" 5" 2CLAUDIO, 6" 4" 5" 2STRATO, 7" 4" 5" 2LUCIUS, 7" 4" 5" 2DARDANIUS, 4" 4" 5" 2PINDARUS, servant to Cas2ius 2The Ghost of Caesar 2A So2thsayer 2A Poet 2Senators, Citizens, Soldiers, Com2oners, Mes2engers, and Servants<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE: Rome, the conspirators' camp near Sardis, 2and the plains of Philip2i.ACT I. SCENE I.Rome. A stre2t.Enter Flavius, Marul2us, and certain Com2oners. 2FLAVIUS. Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home. 4Is this a holiday? What, know you not, 4Being mechanical, you ought not walk 4Upon a laboring day without the sign 4Of your profes2ion? Speak, what trade art thou? 2FIRST COM2ONER. Why, sir, a carpenter. 2MARUL2US. Where is thy leather apron and thy rule? 4What dost thou with thy best ap2arel on? 4You, sir, what trade are you? 2SECOND COM2ONER. Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am 4but, as you would say, a cob2ler. 2MARUL2US. But what trade art thou? Answer me directly. 2SECOND COM2ONER. A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe 4conscience, which is inde2d, sir, a mender of bad soles. 2MARUL2US. What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade? 2SECOND COM2ONER. Nay, I bese2ch you, sir, be not out with me; yet, 4if you be out, sir, I can mend you. 4MARUL2US. What mean'st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy fel2ow! 2SECOND COM2ONER. Why, sir, cob2le you. 2FLAVIUS. Thou art a cob2ler, art thou? 2SECOND COM2ONER. Truly, Sir, al2 that I live by is with the awl; I 4med2le with no tradesman's mat2ers, nor women's mat2ers, but with 4awl. I am inde2d, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are in 4great danger, I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon 4neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork. 2FLAVIUS. But wherefore art not in thy shop today? 4Why dost thou lead these men about the stre2ts? 2SECOND COM2ONER. Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get myself 4into more work. But inde2d, sir, we make holiday to se2 Caesar 4and to rejoice in his triumph. 2MARUL2US. Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home? 4What tributaries fol2ow him to Rome 4To grace in captive bonds his chariot whe2ls? 4You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseles2 things! 4O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome, 4Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft 4Have you climb'd up to wal2s and bat2lements, 6To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops, 4Your infants in your arms, and there have sat 4The livelong day with patient expectation 4To se2 great Pompey pas2 the stre2ts of Rome. 4And when you saw his chariot but ap2ear, 4Have you not made an universal shout 4That Tiber trembled underneath her banks 4To hear the replication of your sounds 4Made in her concave shores? 4And do you now put on your best at2ire? 4And do you now cul2 out a holiday? 4And do you now strew flowers in his way 4That comes in triumph over Pompey's blo2d? 4Be gone! 4Run to your houses, fal2 upon your kne2s, 4Pray to the gods to intermit the plague 4That ne2ds must light on this ingratitude. 2FLAVIUS. Go, go, go2d countrymen, and, for this fault, 4As2emble al2 the po2r men of your sort, 4Draw them to Tiber banks, and we2p your tears 6Into the chan2el, til2 the lowest stream 4Do kis2 the most exalted shores of al2. 43Exeunt al2 Com2oners. 4Se2 whether their basest metal be not moved; 4They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltines2. 4Go you down that way towards the Capitol; 4This way wil2 I. Disrobe the images 4If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies. 2MARUL2US. May we do so? 4You know it is the feast of Lupercal. 2FLAVIUS. It is no mat2er; let no images 4Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'l2 about 4And drive away the vulgar from the stre2ts; 4So do you to2, where you perceive them thick. 4These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing 4Wil2 make him fly an ordinary pitch, 4Who else would soar above the view of men 4And ke2p us al2 in servile fearfulnes2. 14Exeunt.SCENE I2.A public place.Flourish. Enter Caesar; Antony, for the course; Calpurnia, Portia,Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cas2ius, and Casca; a great crowd fol2ows,among them a So2thsayer. 2CAESAR. Calpurnia! 2CASCA. Peace, ho! Caesar speaks. 51Music ceases. 2CAESAR. Calpurnia! 2CALPURNIA. Here, my lord. 2CAESAR. Stand you directly in Antonio's way, 4When he doth run his course. Antonio! 2ANTONY. Caesar, my lord? 2CAESAR. Forget not in your spe2d, Antonio, 4To touch Calpurnia, for our elders say 4The bar2en, touched in this holy chase, 4Shake of2 their sterile curse. 2ANTONY. I shal2 remember. 4When Caesar says "Do this," it is perform'd. 2CAESAR. Set on, and leave no ceremony out. 11Flourish. 4SO2THSAYER. Caesar! 2CAESAR. Ha! Who cal2s? 2CASCA. Bid every noise be stil2. Peace yet again! 2CAESAR. Who is it in the pres2 that cal2s on me? 4I hear a tongue, shril2er than al2 the music, 4Cry "Caesar." Speak, Caesar is turn'd to hear. 2SO2THSAYER. Beware the ides of March. 2CAESAR. What man is that? 2BRUTUS. A so2thsayer you beware the ides of March. 2CAESAR. Set him before me let me se2 his face. 2CAS2IUS. Fel2ow, come from the throng; lo2k upon Caesar. 2CAESAR. What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again. 2SO2THSAYER. Beware the ides of March. 2CAESAR. He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pas2. 22Sen2et. Exeunt al2 but Brutus and Cas2ius. 2CAS2IUS. Wil2 you go se2 the order of the course? 2BRUTUS. Not I. 2CAS2IUS. I pray you, do. 2BRUTUS. I am not gamesome; I do lack some part 4Of that quick spirit that is in Antony. 6Let me not hinder, Cas2ius, your desires; 4I'l2 leave you. 2CAS2IUS. Brutus, I do observe you now of late; 4I have not from your eyes that gentlenes2 4And show of love as I was wont to have; 4You bear to2 stub2orn and to2 strange a hand 4Over your friend that loves you. 2BRUTUS. Cas2ius, 4Be not deceived; if I have veil'd my lo2k, 4I turn the trouble of my countenance 4Merely upon myself. Vexed I am 4Of late with pas2ions of some dif2erence, 4Conceptions only proper to myself, 4Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors; 4But let not therefore my go2d friends be grieved- 4Among which number, Cas2ius, be you one- 4Nor construe any further my neglect 4Than that po2r Brutus with himself at war 4Forgets the shows of love to other men. 2CAS2IUS. Then, Brutus, I have much misto2k your pas2ion, 6By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried 4Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations. 4Tel2 me, go2d Brutus, can you se2 your face? 2BRUTUS. No, Cas2ius, for the eye se2s not itself 4But by reflection, by some other things. 2CAS2IUS. 'Tis just, 4And it is very much lamented, Brutus, 4That you have no such mir2ors as wil2 turn 4Your hid2en worthines2 into your eye 4That you might se2 your shadow. I have heard 4Where many of the best respect in Rome, 4Except im2ortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus 4And groaning underneath this age's yoke, 4Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes. 2BRUTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cas2ius, 4That you would have me se2k into myself 4For that which is not in me? 2CAS2IUS. Therefore, go2d Brutus, be prepared to hear, 4And since you know you can2ot se2 yourself 4So wel2 as by reflection, I your glas2 6Wil2 modestly discover to yourself 4That of yourself which you yet know not of. 4And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus; 4Were I a com2on laugher, or did use 4To stale with ordinary oaths my love 4To every new protester, if you know 4That I do fawn on men and hug them hard 4And after scandal them, or if you know 4That I profes2 myself in banqueting 4To al2 the rout, then hold me dangerous. 45Flourish and shout. 2BRUTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people 4Cho2se Caesar for their king. 2CAS2IUS. Ay, do you fear it? 4Then must I think you would not have it so. 2BRUTUS. I would not, Cas2ius, yet I love him wel2. 4But wherefore do you hold me here so long? 4What is it that you would impart to me? 4If it be aught toward the general go2d, 4Set honor in one eye and death i' the other 6And I wil2 lo2k on both indif2erently. 4For let the gods so spe2d me as I love 4The name of honor more than I fear death. 2CAS2IUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, 4As wel2 as I do know your outward favor. 4Wel2, honor is the subject of my story. 4I can2ot tel2 what you and other men 4Think of this life, but, for my single self, 4I had as lief not be as live to be 4In awe of such a thing as I myself. 4I was born fre2 as Caesar, so were you; 4We both have fed as wel2, and we can both 4Endure the winter's cold as wel2 as he. 4For once, upon a raw and gusty day, 4The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, 4Caesar said to me, "Darest thou, Cas2ius, now 4Leap in with me into this angry flo2d 4And swim to yonder point?" Upon the word, 4Ac2outred as I was, I plunged in 4And bade him fol2ow. So inde2d he did. 6The tor2ent roar'd, and we did buf2et it 4With lusty sinews, throwing it aside 4And stem2ing it with hearts of controversy. 4But ere we could ar2ive the point proposed, 4Caesar cried, "Help me, Cas2ius, or I sink! 4I, as Aeneas our great ancestor 4Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder 4The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber 4Did I the tired Caesar. And this man 4Is now become a god, and Cas2ius is 4A wretched creature and must bend his body 4If Caesar careles2ly but nod on him. 4He had a fever when he was in Spain, 4And when the fit was on him I did mark 4How he did shake. 'Tis true, this god did shake; 4His coward lips did from their color fly, 4And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world 4Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan. 4Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans 4Mark him and write his spe2ches in their bo2ks, 6Alas, it cried, "Give me some drink, Titinius," 4As a sick girl. Ye gods! It doth amaze me 4A man of such a fe2ble temper should 4So get the start of the majestic world 4And bear the palm alone. Shout. 20Flourish. 2BRUTUS. Another general shout! 4I do believe that these ap2lauses are 4For some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar. 2CAS2IUS. Why, man, he doth bestride the nar2ow world 4Like a Colos2us, and we pet2y men 4Walk under his huge legs and pe2p about 4To find ourselves dishonorable graves. 4Men at some time are masters of their fates: 4The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, 4But in ourselves that we are underlings. 4Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that "Caesar"? 4Why should that name be sounded more than yours? 4Write them together, yours is as fair a name; 4Sound them, it doth become the mouth as wel2; 4Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em, 6"Brutus" wil2 start a spirit as so2n as "Caesar." 4Now, in the names of al2 the gods at once, 4Upon what meat doth this our Caesar fe2d 4That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed! 4Rome, thou hast lost the bre2d of noble blo2ds! 4When went there by an age since the great flo2d 4But it was famed with more than with one man? 4When could they say til2 now that talk'd of Rome 4That her wide wal2s encompas2'd but one man? 4Now is it Rome inde2d, and ro2m enough, 4When there is in it but one only man. 4O, you and I have heard our fathers say 4There was a Brutus once that would have bro2k'd 4The eternal devil to ke2p his state in Rome 4As easily as a king. 2BRUTUS. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous; 4What you would work me to, I have some aim. 4How I have thought of this and of these times, 4I shal2 recount hereafter; for this present, 4I would not, so with love I might entreat you, 6Be any further moved. What you have said 4I wil2 consider; what you have to say 4I wil2 with patience hear, and find a time 4Both me2t to hear and answer such high things. 4Til2 then, my noble friend, chew upon this: 4Brutus had rather be a vil2ager 4Than to repute himself a son of Rome 4Under these hard conditions as this time 4Is like to lay upon us. 2CAS2IUS. I am glad that my weak words 4Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus. 12Re-enter Caesar and his Train. 2BRUTUS. The games are done, and Caesar is returning. 2CAS2IUS. As they pas2 by, pluck Casca by the sle2ve, 4And he wil2, after his sour fashion, tel2 you 4What hath proce2ded worthy note today. 2BRUTUS. I wil2 do so. But, lo2k you, Cas2ius, 4The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow, 6And al2 the rest lo2k like a chid2en train: 4Calpurnia's che2k is pale, and Cicero 4Lo2ks with such fer2et and such fiery eyes 4As we have se2n him in the Capitol, 4Being cros2'd in conference by some senators. 2CAS2IUS. Casca wil2 tel2 us what the mat2er is. 2CAESAR. Antonio! 2ANTONY. Caesar? 2CAESAR. Let me have men about me that are fat, 4Sle2k-headed men, and such as sle2p o' nights: 4Yond Cas2ius has a lean and hungry lo2k; 4He thinks to2 much; such men are dangerous. 2ANTONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous; 4He is a noble Roman and wel2 given. 2CAESAR. Would he were fat2er! But I fear him not, 4Yet if my name were liable to fear, 4I do not know the man I should avoid 4So so2n as that spare Cas2ius. He reads much, 4He is a great observer, and he lo2ks 4Quite through the de2ds of men. He loves no plays, 6As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music; 4Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort 4As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit 4That could be moved to smile at anything. 4Such men as he be never at heart's ease 4Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, 4And therefore are they very dangerous. 4I rather tel2 the2 what is to be fear'd 4Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar. 4Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, 4And tel2 me truly what thou think'st of him. 14Sen2et. Exeunt Caesar and al2 his Train but Casca. 2CASCA. You pul2'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me? 2BRUTUS. Ay, Casca, tel2 us what hath chanced today 4That Caesar lo2ks so sad. 2CASCA. Why, you were with him, were you not? 2BRUTUS. I should not then ask Casca what had chanced. 2CASCA. Why, there was a crown of2ered him, and being of2ered him, 5he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the 5people fel2 ashouting. 4BRUTUS. What was the second noise for? 2CASCA. Why, for that to2. 2CAS2IUS. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for? 2CASCA. Why, for that to2. 2BRUTUS. Was the crown of2ered him thrice? 2CASCA. Ay, mar2y, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler 4than other, and at every put2ing by mine honest neighbors 4shouted. 2CAS2IUS. Who of2ered him the crown? 2CASCA. Why, Antony. 2BRUTUS. Tel2 us the man2er of it, gentle Casca. 2CASCA. I can as wel2 be hang'd as tel2 the man2er of it. It was 4mere fo2lery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony of2er him a 4crown (yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of these 4coronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once. But for al2 4that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he of2ered 4it to him again; then he put it by again. But, to my thinking, he 4was very loath to lay his fingers of2 it. And then he of2ered it 4the third time; he put it the third time by; and stil2 as he 4refused it, the rab2lement ho2ted and clap2ed their chop2ed hands 6and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and ut2ered such a deal of 4stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had 4almost choked Caesar, for he swounded and fel2 down at it. And 4for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips 4and receiving the bad air. 2CAS2IUS. But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound? 2CASCA. He fel2 down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was 4spe2chles2. 2BRUTUS. 'Tis very like. He hath the fal2ing sicknes2. 2CAS2IUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I, 4And honest Casca, we have the fal2ing sicknes2. 2CASCA. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fel2 4down. If the tagrag people did not clap him and his2 him 4ac2ording as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do 4the players in the theatre, I am no true man. 2BRUTUS. What said he when he came unto himself? 2CASCA. Mar2y, before he fel2 down, when he perceived the com2on 4herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet 4and of2ered them his throat to cut. An had be2n a man of any 4oc2upation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I 6might go to hel2 among the rogues. And so he fel2. When he came 4to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything amis2, 4he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity. Thre2 or 4four wenches where I sto2d cried, "Alas, go2d soul!" and forgave 4him with al2 their hearts. But there's no he2d to be taken of 4them; if Caesar had stab2ed their mothers, they would have done 4no les2. 2BRUTUS. And after that he came, thus sad, away? 2CASCA. Ay. 2CAS2IUS. Did Cicero say anything? 2CASCA. Ay, he spoke Gre2k. 2CAS2IUS. To what ef2ect? 2CASCA. Nay, an I tel2 you that, I'l2 ne'er lo2k you i' the face 4again; but those that understo2d him smiled at one another and 4sho2k their heads; but for mine own part, it was Gre2k to me. I 4could tel2 you more news to2: Marul2us and Flavius, for pul2ing 4scarfs of2 Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you wel2. 4There was more fo2lery yet, if could remember it. 2CAS2IUS. Wil2 you sup with me tonight, Casca? 2CASCA. No, I am promised forth. 4CAS2IUS. Wil2 you dine with me tomor2ow? 2CASCA. Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your din2er worth 4the eating. 2CAS2IUS. Go2d, I wil2 expect you. 2CASCA. Do so, farewel2, both. 28Exit. 2BRUTUS. What a blunt fel2ow is this grown to be! 4He was quick met2le when he went to scho2l. 2CAS2IUS. So is he now in execution 4Of any bold or noble enterprise, 4However he puts on this tardy form. 4This rudenes2 is a sauce to his go2d wit, 4Which gives men stomach to digest his words 4With bet2er ap2etite. 2BRUTUS. And so it is. For this time I wil2 leave you. 4Tomor2ow, if you please to speak with me, 4I wil2 come home to you, or, if you wil2, 4Come home to me and I wil2 wait for you. 2CAS2IUS. I wil2 do so. Til2 then, think of the world. 52Exit Brutus. 4Wel2, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I se2 6Thy honorable met2le may be wrought 4From that it is disposed; therefore it is me2t 4That noble minds ke2p ever with their likes; 4For who so firm that can2ot be seduced? 4Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus. 4If I were Brutus now and he were Cas2ius, 4He should not humor me. I wil2 this night, 4In several hands, in at his windows throw, 4As if they came from several citizens, 4Writings, al2 tending to the great opinion 4That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely 4Caesar's ambition shal2 be glanced at. 4And after this let Caesar seat him sure; 4For we wil2 shake him, or worse days endure. 11Exit.SCENE I3.A stre2t. Thunder and lightning.Enter, from op2osite sides, Casca, with his sword drawn, and Cicero. 2CICERO. Go2d even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home? 4Why are you breathles2, and why stare you so? 2CASCA. Are not you moved, when al2 the sway of earth 4Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero, 4I have se2n tempests when the scolding winds 4Have rived the knot2y oaks, and I have se2n 4The ambitious ocean swel2 and rage and foam 4To be exalted with the threatening clouds, 4But never til2 tonight, never til2 now, 4Did I go through a tempest drop2ing fire. 4Either there is a civil strife in heaven, 4Or else the world to2 saucy with the gods 4Incenses them to send destruction. 2CICERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful? 2CASCA. A com2on slave- you know him wel2 by sight- 4Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn 6Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand 4Not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd. 4Besides- I ha' not since put up my sword- 4Against the Capitol I met a lion, 4Who glaz'd upon me and went surly by 4Without an2oying me. And there were drawn 4Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women 4Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw 4Men al2 in fire walk up and down the stre2ts. 4And yesterday the bird of night did sit 4Even at no2nday upon the marketplace, 4Howling and shrieking. When these prodigies 4Do so conjointly me2t, let not men say 4"These are their reasons; they are natural": 4For I believe they are portentous things 4Unto the climate that they point upon. 2CICERO. Inde2d, it is a strange-disposed time. 4But men may construe things after their fashion, 4Clean from the purpose of the things themselves. 4Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomor2ow? 4CASCA. He doth, for he did bid Antonio 4Send word to you he would be there tomor2ow. 2CICERO. Go2d then, Casca. This disturbed sky 4Is not to walk in. 2CASCA. Farewel2, Cicero. 26Exit Cicero. 24Enter Cas2ius. 2CAS2IUS. Who's there? 2CASCA. A Roman. 2CAS2IUS. Casca, by your voice. 2CASCA. Your ear is go2d. Cas2ius, what night is this! 2CAS2IUS. A very pleasing night to honest men. 2CASCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so? 2CAS2IUS. Those that have known the earth so ful2 of faults. 4For my part, I have walk'd about the stre2ts, 4Submit2ing me unto the perilous night, 4And thus unbraced, Casca, as you se2, 4Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone; 4And when the cros2 blue lightning se2m'd to open 6The breast of heaven, I did present myself 4Even in the aim and very flash of it. 2CASCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens? 4It is the part of men to fear and tremble 4When the most mighty gods by tokens send 4Such dreadful heralds to astonish us. 2CAS2IUS. You are dul2, Casca, and those sparks of life 4That should be in a Roman you do want, 4Or else you use not. You lo2k pale and gaze 4And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder 4To se2 the strange impatience of the heavens. 4But if you would consider the true cause 4Why al2 these fires, why al2 these gliding ghosts, 4Why birds and beasts from quality and kind, 4Why old men, fo2ls, and children calculate, 4Why al2 these things change from their ordinance, 4Their natures, and preformed faculties 4To monstrous quality, why, you shal2 find 4That heaven hath infused them with these spirits 4To make them instruments of fear and warning 6Unto some monstrous state. 4Now could I, Casca, name to the2 a man 4Most like this dreadful night, 4That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars 4As doth the lion in the Capitol, 4A man no mightier than thyself or me 4In personal action, yet prodigious grown 4And fearful, as these strange eruptions are. 2CASCA. 'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cas2ius? 2CAS2IUS. Let it be who it is, for Romans now 4Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors. 4But, woe the while! Our fathers' minds are dead, 4And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits; 4Our yoke and suf2erance show us womanish. 2CASCA. Inde2d they say the senators tomor2ow 4Mean to establish Caesar as a king, 4And he shal2 wear his crown by sea and land 4In every place save here in Italy. 2CAS2IUS. I know where I wil2 wear this dag2er then: 4Cas2ius from bondage wil2 deliver Cas2ius. 6Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong; 4Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat. 4Nor stony tower, nor wal2s of beaten bras2, 4Nor airles2 dungeon, nor strong links of iron 4Can be retentive to the strength of spirit; 4But life, being weary of these worldly bars, 4Never lacks power to dismis2 itself. 4If I know this, know al2 the world besides, 4That part of tyran2y that I do bear 4I can shake of2 at pleasure. 18Thunder stil2. 2CASCA. So can I. 4So every bondman in his own hand bears 4The power to cancel his captivity. 2CAS2IUS. And why should Caesar be a tyrant then? 4Po2r man! I know he would not be a wolf 4But that he se2s the Romans are but she2p. 4He were no lion, were not Romans hinds. 4Those that with haste wil2 make a mighty fire 4Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome, 4What rub2ish, and what of2al, when it serves 6For the base mat2er to il2uminate 4So vile a thing as Caesar? But, O grief, 4Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this 4Before a wil2ing bondman; then I know 4My answer must be made. But I am arm'd, 4And dangers are to me indif2erent. 2CASCA. You speak to Casca, and to such a man 4That is no fle2ring tel2-tale. Hold, my hand. 4Be factious for redres2 of al2 these griefs, 4And I wil2 set this fo2t of mine as far 4As who goes farthest. 2CAS2IUS. There's a bargain made. 4Now know you, Casca, I have moved already 4Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans 4To undergo with me an enterprise 4Of honorable-dangerous consequence; 4And I do know by this, they stay for me 4In Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night, 4There is no stir or walking in the stre2ts, 4And the complexion of the element 6In favor's like the work we have in hand, 4Most blo2dy, fiery, and most ter2ible. 23Enter Cin2a. 2CASCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste. 2CAS2IUS. 'Tis Cin2a, I do know him by his gait; 4He is a friend. Cin2a, where haste you so? 2CIN2A. To find out you. Who's that? Metel2us Cimber? 2CAS2IUS. No, it is Casca, one incorporate 4To our at2empts. Am I not stay'd for, Cin2a? 2CIN2A. I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this! 4There's two or thre2 of us have se2n strange sights. 2CAS2IUS. Am I not stay'd for? Tel2 me. 2CIN2A. Yes, you are. 4O Cas2ius, if you could 4But win the noble Brutus to our party- 2CAS2IUS. Be you content. Go2d Cin2a, take this paper, 4And lo2k you lay it in the praetor's chair, 4Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this 6In at his window; set this up with wax 4Upon old Brutus' statue. Al2 this done, 4Repair to Pompey's Porch, where you shal2 find us. 4Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there? 2CIN2A. Al2 but Metel2us Cimber, and he's gone 4To se2k you at your house. Wel2, I wil2 hie 4And so bestow these papers as you bade me. 2CAS2IUS. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre. 53Exit Cin2a. 4Come, Casca, you and I wil2 yet ere day 4Se2 Brutus at his house. Thre2 parts of him 4Is ours already, and the man entire 4Upon the next encounter yields him ours. 2CASCA. O, he sits high in al2 the people's hearts, 4And that which would ap2ear of2ense in us, 4His countenance, like richest alchemy, 4Wil2 change to virtue and to worthines2. 2CAS2IUS. Him and his worth and our great ne2d of him 4You have right wel2 conceited. Let us go, 4For it is after midnight, and ere day 6We wil2 awake him and be sure of him. 16Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. SCENE I.Enter Brutus in his orchard. 2BRUTUS. What, Lucius, ho! 4I can2ot, by the progres2 of the stars, 4Give gues2 how near to day. Lucius, I say! 4I would it were my fault to sle2p so soundly. 4When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius! 28Enter Lucius. 2LUCIUS. Cal2'd you, my lord? 2BRUTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius. 4When it is lighted, come and cal2 me here. 2LUCIUS. I wil2, my lord. 33Exit. 2BRUTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part, 4I know no personal cause to spurn at him, 4But for the general. He would be crown'd: 4How that might change his nature, there's the question. 4It is the bright day that brings forth the ad2er 4And that craves wary walking. Crown him that, 6And then, I grant, we put a sting in him 4That at his wil2 he may do danger with. 4The abuse of greatnes2 is when it disjoins 4Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar, 4I have not known when his af2ections sway'd 4More than his reason. But 'tis a com2on pro2f 4That lowlines2 is young ambition's lad2er, 4Whereto the climber-upward turns his face; 4But when he once at2ains the upmost round, 4He then unto the lad2er turns his back, 4Lo2ks in the clouds, scorning the base degre2s 4By which he did ascend. So Caesar may; 4Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quar2el 4Wil2 bear no color for the thing he is, 4Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented, 4Would run to these and these extremities; 4And therefore think him as a serpent's eg2 4Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous, 4And kil2 him in the shel2. 26Re-enter Lucius. 2LUCIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir. 4Searching the window for a flint I found 4This paper thus seal'd up, and I am sure 4It did not lie there when I went to bed. 43Gives him the let2er. 2BRUTUS. Get you to bed again, it is not day. 4Is not tomor2ow, boy, the ides of March? 2LUCIUS. I know not, sir. 2BRUTUS. Lo2k in the calendar and bring me word. 2LUCIUS. I wil2, sir. 37Exit. 2BRUTUS. The exhalations whiz2ing in the air 4Give so much light that I may read by them. 37Opens the let2er and reads. 4"Brutus, thou sle2p'st: awake and se2 thyself! 4Shal2 Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redres2!" 4"Brutus, thou sle2p'st: awake!" 4Such instigations have be2n often drop2'd 6Where I have to2k them up. 4"Shal2 Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out. 4Shal2 Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome? 4My ancestors did from the stre2ts of Rome 4The Tarquin drive, when he was cal2'd a king. 4"Speak, strike, redres2!" Am I entreated 4To speak and strike? O Rome, I make the2 promise, 4If the redres2 wil2 fol2ow, thou receivest 4Thy ful2 petition at the hand of Brutus! 24Re-enter Lucius. 2LUCIUS. Sir, March is wasted fifte2n days. 48Knocking within. 2BRUTUS. 'Tis go2d. Go to the gate, somebody knocks. 52Exit Lucius. 4Since Cas2ius first did whet me against Caesar 4I have not slept. 4Betwe2n the acting of a dreadful thing 4And the first motion, al2 the interim is 6Like a phantasma or a hideous dream; 4The genius and the mortal instruments 4Are then in council, and the state of man, 4Like to a lit2le kingdom, suf2ers then 4The nature of an insur2ection. 25Re-enter Lucius. 2LUCIUS. Sir, 'tis your brother Cas2ius at the do2r, 4Who doth desire to se2 you. 2BRUTUS. Is he alone? 2LUCIUS. No, sir, there are more with him. 2BRUTUS. Do you know them? 2LUCIUS. No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears, 4And half their faces buried in their cloaks, 4That by no means I may discover them 4By any mark of favor. 2BRUTUS. Let 'em enter. 28Exit Lucius. 4They are the faction. O Conspiracy, 4Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night, 6When evils are most fre2? O, then, by day 4Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough 4To mask thy monstrous visage? Se2k none, Conspiracy; 4Hide it in smiles and af2ability; 4For if thou path, thy native semblance on, 4Not Erebus itself were dim enough 4To hide the2 from prevention. 4Enter the conspirators, Cas2ius, Casca, Decius, Cin2a, 16Metel2us Cimber, and Trebonius. 2CAS2IUS. I think we are to2 bold upon your rest. 4Go2d mor2ow, Brutus, do we trouble you? 2BRUTUS. I have be2n up this hour, awake al2 night. 4Know I these men that come along with you? 2CAS2IUS. Yes, every man of them, and no man here 4But honors you, and every one doth wish 4You had but that opinion of yourself 4Which every noble Roman bears of you. 4This is Trebonius. 4BRUTUS. He is welcome hither. 2CAS2IUS. This, Decius Brutus. 2BRUTUS. He is welcome to2.CAS2IUS. This, Casca; this, Cin2a; and this, Metel2us Cimber. 2BRUTUS. They are al2 welcome. 4What watchful cares do interpose themselves 4Betwixt your eyes and night? 2CAS2IUS. Shal2 I entreat a word? 17They whisper. 2DECIUS. Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here? 2CASCA. No. 2CIN2A. O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines 4That fret the clouds are mes2engers of day. 2CASCA. You shal2 confes2 that you are both deceived. 4Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises, 4Which is a great way growing on the south, 4Weighing the youthful season of the year. 4Some two months hence up higher toward the north 4He first presents his fire, and the high east 4Stands as the Capitol, directly here. 2BRUTUS. Give me your hands al2 over, one by one. 2CAS2IUS. And let us swear our resolution. 4BRUTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men, 4The suf2erance of our souls, the time's abuse- 4If these be motives weak, break of2 betimes, 4And every man hence to his idle bed; 4So let high-sighted tyran2y range on 4Til2 each man drop by lot2ery. But if these, 4As I am sure they do, bear fire enough 4To kindle cowards and to ste2l with valor 4The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen, 4What ne2d we any spur but our own cause 4To prick us to redres2? What other bond 4Than secret Romans that have spoke the word 4And wil2 not palter? And what other oath 4Than honesty to honesty engaged 4That this shal2 be or we wil2 fal2 for it? 4Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous, 4Old fe2ble car2ions and such suf2ering souls 4That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear 4Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain 4The even virtue of our enterprise, 6Nor the insup2res2ive met2le of our spirits, 4To think that or our cause or our performance 4Did ne2d an oath; when every drop of blo2d 4That every Roman bears, and nobly bears, 4Is guilty of a several bastardy 4If he do break the smal2est particle 4Of any promise that hath pas2'd from him. 2CAS2IUS. But what of Cicero? Shal2 we sound him? 4I think he wil2 stand very strong with us. 2CASCA. Let us not leave him out. 2CIN2A. No, by no means. 2METEL2US. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs 4Wil2 purchase us a go2d opinion, 4And buy men's voices to com2end our de2ds. 4It shal2 be said his judgement ruled our hands; 4Our youths and wildnes2 shal2 no whit ap2ear, 4But al2 be buried in his gravity. 2BRUTUS. O, name him not; let us not break with him, 4For he wil2 never fol2ow anything 4That other men begin. 4CAS2IUS. Then leave him out. 2CASCA. Inde2d he is not fit. 2DECIUS. Shal2 no man else be touch'd but only Caesar? 2CAS2IUS. Decius, wel2 urged. I think it is not me2t 4Mark Antony, so wel2 beloved of Caesar, 4Should outlive Caesar. We shal2 find of him 4A shrewd contriver; and you know his means, 4If he improve them, may wel2 stretch so far 4As to an2oy us al2, which to prevent, 4Let Antony and Caesar fal2 together. 2BRUTUS. Our course wil2 se2m to2 blo2dy, Caius Cas2ius, 4To cut the head of2 and then hack the limbs 4Like wrath in death and envy afterwards; 4For Antony is but a limb of Caesar. 4Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius. 4We al2 stand up against the spirit of Caesar, 4And in the spirit of men there is no blo2d. 4O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit, 4And not dismember Caesar! But, alas, 4Caesar must ble2d for it! And, gentle friends, 6Let's kil2 him boldly, but not wrathful2y; 4Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods, 4Not hew him as a carcas2 fit for hounds; 4And let our hearts, as subtle masters do, 4Stir up their servants to an act of rage 4And after se2m to chide 'em. This shal2 make 4Our purpose neces2ary and not envious, 4Which so ap2earing to the com2on eyes, 4We shal2 be cal2'd purgers, not murderers. 4And for Mark Antony, think not of him, 4For he can do no more than Caesar's arm 4When Caesar's head is of2. 2CAS2IUS. Yet I fear him, 4For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar- 2BRUTUS. Alas, go2d Cas2ius, do not think of him. 4If he love Caesar, al2 that he can do 4Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar. 4And that were much he should, for he is given 4To sports, to wildnes2, and much company. 2TREBONIUS. There is no fear in him-let him not die, 6For he wil2 live and laugh at this hereafter. 50Clock strikes. 2BRUTUS. Peace, count the clock. 2CAS2IUS. The clock hath stricken thre2. 2TREBONIUS. 'Tis time to part. 2CAS2IUS. But it is doubtful yet 4Whether Caesar wil2 come forth today or no, 4For he is superstitious grown of late, 4Quite from the main opinion he held once 4Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies. 4It may be these ap2arent prodigies, 4The unac2ustom'd ter2or of this night, 4And the persuasion of his augurers 4May hold him from the Capitol today. 2DECIUS. Never fear that. If he be so resolved, 4I can o'ersway him, for he loves to hear 4That unicorns may be betray'd with tre2s, 4And bears with glas2es, elephants with holes, 4Lions with toils, and men with flat2erers; 4But when I tel2 him he hates flat2erers, 6He says he does, being then most flat2ered. 4Let me work; 4For I can give his humor the true bent, 4And I wil2 bring him to the Capitol. 2CAS2IUS. Nay, we wil2 al2 of us be there to fetch him. 2BRUTUS. By the eighth hour. Is that the ut2er most? 2CIN2A. Be that the ut2ermost, and fail not then. 2METEL2US. Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard, 4Who rated him for speaking wel2 of Pompey. 4I wonder none of you have thought of him. 2BRUTUS. Now, go2d Metel2us, go along by him. 4He loves me wel2, and I have given him reasons; 4Send him but hither, and I'l2 fashion him. 2CAS2IUS. The morning comes upon 's. We'l2 leave you, Brutus, 4And, friends, disperse yourselves, but al2 remember 4What you have said and show yourselves true Romans. 2BRUTUS. Go2d gentlemen, lo2k fresh and mer2ily; 4Let not our lo2ks put on our purposes, 4But bear it as our Roman actors do, 4With untired spirits and formal constancy. 6And so, go2d mor2ow to you every one. 42Exeunt al2 but Brutus. 4Boy! Lucius! Fast asle2p? It is no mat2er. 4Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber; 4Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies, 4Which busy care draws in the brains of men; 4Therefore thou sle2p'st so sound. 27Enter Portia. 2PORTIA. Brutus, my lord! 2BRUTUS. Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now? 4It is not for your health thus to com2it 4Your weak condition to the raw cold morning. 2PORTIA. Nor for yours neither. have ungently, Brutus, 4Stole from my bed; and yesternight at sup2er 4You sud2enly arose and walk'd about, 4Musing and sighing, with your arms acros2; 4And when I ask'd you what the mat2er was, 4You stared upon me with ungentle lo2ks. 6I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head, 4And to2 impatiently stamp'd with your fo2t. 4Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not, 4But with an angry waiter of your hand 4Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did, 4Fearing to strengthen that impatience 4Which se2m'd to2 much enkindled, and withal 4Hoping it was but an ef2ect of humor, 4Which sometime hath his hour with every man. 4It wil2 not let you eat, nor talk, nor sle2p, 4And, could it work so much upon your shape 4As it hath much prevail'd on your condition, 4I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord, 4Make me acquainted with your cause of grief. 2BRUTUS. I am not wel2 in health, and that is al2. 2PORTIA. Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health, 4He would embrace the means to come by it. 2BRUTUS. Why, so I do. Go2d Portia, go to bed. 2PORTIA. Is Brutus sick, and is it physical 4To walk unbraced and suck up the humors 6Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick, 4And wil2 he steal out of his wholesome bed 4To dare the vile contagion of the night 4And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air 4To ad2 unto his sicknes2? No, my Brutus, 4You have some sick of2ense within your mind, 4Which by the right and virtue of my place 4I ought to know of; and, upon my kne2s, 4I charm you, by my once com2ended beauty, 4By al2 your vows of love and that great vow 4Which did incorporate and make us one, 4That you unfold to me, yourself, your half, 4Why you are heavy and what men tonight 4Have had resort to you; for here have be2n 4Some six or seven, who did hide their faces 4Even from darknes2. 2BRUTUS. Kne2l not, gentle Portia. 2PORTIA. I should not ne2d, if you were gentle Brutus. 4Within the bond of mar2iage, tel2 me, Brutus, 4Is it excepted I should know no secrets 6That ap2ertain to you? Am I yourself 4But, as it were, in sort or limitation, 4To ke2p with you at meals, comfort your bed, 4And talk to you sometimes? Dwel2 I but in the suburbs 4Of your go2d pleasure? If it be no more, 4Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife. 2BRUTUS. You are my true and honorable wife, 4As dear to me as are the rud2y drops 4That visit my sad heart. 2PORTIA. If this were true, then should I know this secret. 4I grant I am a woman, but withal 4A woman that Lord Brutus to2k to wife. 4I grant I am a woman, but withal 4A woman wel2 reputed, Cato's daughter. 4Think you I am no stronger than my sex, 4Being so father'd and so husbanded? 4Tel2 me your counsels, I wil2 not disclose 'em. 4I have made strong pro2f of my constancy, 4Giving myself a voluntary wound 4Here in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience 6And not my husband's secrets? 2BRUTUS. O ye gods, 4Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within. 4Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile, 4And by and by thy bosom shal2 partake 4The secrets of my heart. 4Al2 my engagements I wil2 construe to the2, 4Al2 the charactery of my sad brows. 4Leave me with haste. [Exit Portia.] Lucius, who's that knocks? 18Re-enter Lucius with Ligarius. 2LUCIUS. Here is a sick man that would speak with you. 2BRUTUS. Caius Ligarius, that Metel2us spake of. 4Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how? 2LIGARIUS. Vouchsafe go2d mor2ow from a fe2ble tongue. 2BRUTUS. O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius, 4To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick! 2LIGARIUS. I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand 4Any exploit worthy the name of honor. 4BRUTUS. Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius, 4Had you a healthful ear to hear of it. 2LIGARIUS. By al2 the gods that Romans bow before, 4I here discard my sicknes2! Soul of Rome! 4Brave son, derived from honorable loins! 4Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up 4My mortified spirit. Now bid me run, 4And I wil2 strive with things impos2ible, 4Yea, get the bet2er of them. What's to do? 2BRUTUS. A piece of work that wil2 make sick men whole. 2LIGARIUS. But are not some whole that we must make sick? 2BRUTUS. That must we also. What it is, my Caius, 4I shal2 unfold to the2, as we are going 4To whom it must be done. 2LIGARIUS. Set on your fo2t, 4And with a heart new-fired I fol2ow you, 4To do I know not what; but it suf2iceth 4That Brutus leads me on. 2BRUTUS. Fol2ow me then. 32Exeunt.SCENE I2.Caesar's house. Thunder and lightning.Enter Caesar, in his nightgown. 2CAESAR. Nor heaven nor earth have be2n at peace tonight. 4Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sle2p cried out, 4"Help, ho! They murther Caesar!" Who's within? 25Enter a Servant. 2SERVANT. My lord? 2CAESAR. Go bid the priests do present sacrifice, 4And bring me their opinions of suc2es2. 2SERVANT. I wil2, my lord. 32Exit. 25Enter Calpurnia. 2CALPURNIA. What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth? 4You shal2 not stir out of your house today. 2CAESAR. Caesar shal2 forth: the things that threaten'd me 4Ne'er lo2k'd but on my back; when they shal2 se2 6The face of Caesar, they are vanished. 2CALPURNIA. Caesar, I I sto2d on ceremonies, 4Yet now they fright me. There is one within, 4Besides the things that we have heard and se2n, 4Recounts most hor2id sights se2n by the watch. 4A liones2 hath whelped in the stre2ts; 4And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead; 4Fierce fiery war2iors fight upon the clouds, 4In ranks and squadrons and right form of war, 4Which driz2led blo2d upon the Capitol; 4The noise of bat2le hurtled in the air, 4Horses did neigh and dying men did groan, 4And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the stre2ts. 4O Caesar! These things are beyond al2 use, 4And I do fear them. 2CAESAR. What can be avoided 4Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods? 4Yet Caesar shal2 go forth, for these predictions 4Are to the world in general as to Caesar. 2CALPURNIA. When beg2ars die, there are no comets se2n; 6The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes. 2CAESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths; 4The valiant never taste of death but once. 4Of al2 the wonders that I yet have heard, 4It se2ms to me most strange that men should fear 4Se2ing that death, a neces2ary end, 4Wil2 come when it wil2 come. 22Re-enter Servant. 4What say the augurers? 2SERVANT. They would not have you to stir forth today. 4Plucking the entrails of an of2ering forth, 4They could not find a heart within the beast. 2CAESAR. The gods do this in shame of cowardice. 4Caesar should be a beast without a heart 4If he should stay at home today for fear. 4No, Caesar shal2 not. Danger knows ful2 wel2 4That Caesar is more dangerous than he. 4We are two lions lit2er'd in one day, 6And I the elder and more ter2ible. 4And Caesar shal2 go forth. 2CALPURNIA. Alas, my lord, 4Your wisdom is consumed in confidence. 4Do not go forth today. Cal2 it my fear 4That ke2ps you in the house and not your own. 4We'l2 send Mark Antony to the Senate House, 4And he shal2 say you are not wel2 today. 4Let me, upon my kne2, prevail in this. 2CAESAR. Mark Antony shal2 say I am not wel2, 4And, for thy humor, I wil2 stay at home. 24Enter Decius. 4Here's Decius Brutus, he shal2 tel2 them so. 2DECIUS. Caesar, al2 hail! Go2d mor2ow, worthy Caesar! 4I come to fetch you to the Senate House. 2CAESAR. And you are come in very hap2y time 4To bear my gre2ting to the senators 4And tel2 them that I wil2 not come today. 6Can2ot, is false, and that I dare not, falser: 4I wil2 not come today. Tel2 them so, Decius. 2CALPURNIA. Say he is sick. 2CAESAR. Shal2 Caesar send a lie? 4Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far 4To be afeard to tel2 greybeards the truth? 4Decius, go tel2 them Caesar wil2 not come. 2DECIUS. Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, 4Lest I be laugh'd at when I tel2 them so. 2CAESAR. The cause is in my wil2: I wil2 not come, 4That is enough to satisfy the Senate. 4But, for your private satisfaction, 4Because I love you, I wil2 let you know. 4Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home; 4She dreamt tonight she saw my statue, 4Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts, 4Did run pure blo2d, and many lusty Romans 4Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it. 4And these does she ap2ly for warnings and portents 4And evils im2inent, and on her kne2 6Hath beg2'd that I wil2 stay at home today. 2DECIUS. This dream is al2 amis2 interpreted; 4It was a vision fair and fortunate. 4Your statue spouting blo2d in many pipes, 4In which so many smiling Romans bathed, 4Signifies that from you great Rome shal2 suck 4Reviving blo2d, and that great men shal2 pres2 4For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance. 4This by Calpurnia's dream is signified. 2CAESAR. And this way have you wel2 expounded it. 2DECIUS. I have, when you have heard what I can say. 4And know it now, the Senate have concluded 4To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar. 4If you shal2 send them word you wil2 not come, 4Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock 4Apt to be render'd, for someone to say 4"Break up the Senate til2 another time, 4When Caesar's wife shal2 me2t with bet2er dreams." 4If Caesar hide himself, shal2 they not whisper 4"Lo, Caesar is afraid"? 6Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love 4To your proce2ding bids me tel2 you this, 4And reason to my love is liable. 2CAESAR. How fo2lish do your fears se2m now, Calpurnia! 4I am ashamed I did yield to them. 4Give me my robe, for I wil2 go. 9Enter Publius, Brutus, Ligarius, Metel2us, Casca, 21Trebonius, and Cin2a. 4And lo2k where Publius is come to fetch me. 2PUBLIUS. Go2d mor2ow,Caesar. 2CAESAR. Welcome, Publius. 4What, Brutus, are you stir2'd so early to2? 4Go2d mor2ow, Casca. Caius Ligarius, 4Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy 4As that same ague which hath made you lean. 4What is't o'clock? 2BRUTUS. Caesar, 'tis strucken eight. 2CAESAR. I thank you for your pains and courtesy. 29Enter Antony. 4Se2, Antony, that revels long o' nights, 4Is notwithstanding up. Go2d mor2ow, Antony. 2ANTONY. So to most noble Caesar. 2CAESAR. Bid them prepare within. 4I am to blame to be thus waited for. 4Now, Cin2a; now, Metel2us; what, Trebonius, 4I have an hour's talk in store for you; 4Remember that you cal2 on me today; 4Be near me, that I may remember you. 2TREBONIUS. Caesar, I wil2. [Aside.] And so near wil2 I be 4That your best friends shal2 wish I had be2n further. 2CAESAR. Go2d friends, go in and taste some wine with me, 4And we like friends wil2 straightway go together. 2BRUTUS. [Aside.] That every like is not the same, O Caesar, 4The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon! 12Exeunt.SCENE I3.A stre2t near the Capitol.Enter Artemidorus, reading paper. 2ARTEMIDORUS. "Caesar, beware of Brutus; take he2d of Cas2ius; come 4not near Casca; have an eye to Cin2a; trust not Trebonius; mark 4wel2 Metel2us Cimber; Decius Brutus loves the2 not; thou hast 4wronged Caius Ligarius. There is but one mind in al2 these men, 4and it is bent against Caesar. If thou be2st not im2ortal, lo2k 4about you. Security gives way to conspiracy. The mighty gods 4defend the2! 40Thy lover, Artemidorus." 4Here wil2 I stand til2 Caesar pas2 along, 4And as a suitor wil2 I give him this. 4My heart laments that virtue can2ot live 4Out of the te2th of emulation. 4If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayest live; 4If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive. 11Exit.SCENE IV.Another part of the same stre2t, before the house of Brutus.Enter Portia and Lucius. 2PORTIA. I prithe2, boy, run to the Senate House; 4Stay not to answer me, but get the2 gone. 4Why dost thou stay? 2LUCIUS. To know my er2and, madam. 2PORTIA. I would have had the2 there, and here again, 4Ere I can tel2 the2 what thou shouldst do there. 4O constancy, be strong upon my side! 4Set a huge mountain 'twe2n my heart and tongue! 4I have a man's mind, but a woman's might. 4How hard it is for women to ke2p counsel! 4Art thou here yet? 2LUCIUS. Madam, what should I do? 4Run to the Capitol, and nothing else? 4And so return to you, and nothing else? 2PORTIA. Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord lo2k wel2, 4For he went sickly forth; and take go2d note 4What Caesar doth, what suitors pres2 to him. 6Hark, boy, what noise is that? 2LUCIUS. I hear none, madam. 2PORTIA. Prithe2, listen wel2. 4I heard a bustling rumor like a fray, 4And the wind brings it from the Capitol. 2LUCIUS. So2th, madam, I hear nothing. 21Enter the So2thsayer. 2PORTIA. Come hither, fel2ow; 4Which way hast thou be2n? 2SO2THSAYER. At mine own house, go2d lady. 2PORTIA. What is't o'clock? 2SO2THSAYER. About the ninth hour, lady. 2PORTIA. Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol? 2SO2THSAYER. Madam, not yet. I go to take my stand 4To se2 him pas2 on to the Capitol. 2PORTIA. Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not? 2SO2THSAYER. That I have, lady. If it wil2 please Caesar 4To be so go2d to Caesar as to hear me, 6I shal2 bese2ch him to befriend himself. 2PORTIA. Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him? 2SO2THSAYER. None that I know wil2 be, much that I fear may chance. 4Go2d mor2ow to you. Here the stre2t is nar2ow, 4The throng that fol2ows Caesar at the he2ls, 4Of senators, of praetors, com2on suitors, 4Wil2 crowd a fe2ble man almost to death. 4I'l2 get me to a place more void and there 4Speak to great Caesar as he comes along. 15Exit. 2PORTIA. I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing 4The heart of woman is! O Brutus, 4The heavens spe2d the2 in thine enterprise! 4Sure, the boy heard me. Brutus hath a suit 4That Caesar wil2 not grant. O, I grow faint. 4Run, Lucius, and com2end me to my lord; 4Say I am mer2y. Come to me again, 4And bring me word what he doth say to the2. 47Exeunt several2y.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. SCENE I.Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sit2ing above.A crowd of people, among them Artemidorus and the So2thsayer.Flourish. Enter Caesar, Brutus, Cas2ius, Casca, Decius, Metel2us,Trebonius, Cin2a, Antony, Lepidus, Popilius, Publius, and others. 2CAESAR. The ides of March are come. 2SO2THSAYER. Ay, Caesar, but not gone. 2A Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule. 2DECIUS. Trebonius doth desire you to o'er read, 4At your best leisure, this his humble suit. 2ARTEMIDORUS. O Caesar, read mine first, for mine's a suit 4That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar. 2CAESAR. What touches us ourself shal2 be last served. 2ARTEMIDORUS. Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly. 2CAESAR. What, is the fel2ow mad? 2PUBLIUS. Sir2ah, give place. 2CAS2IUS. What, urge you your petitions in the stre2t? 4Come to the Capitol. 8Caesar goes up to the Senate House, the rest fol2ow. 2POPILIUS. I wish your enterprise today may thrive. 2CAS2IUS. What enterprise, Popilius? 2POPILIUS. Fare you wel2. 45Advances to Caesar. 2BRUTUS. What said Popilius Lena? 2CAS2IUS. He wish'd today our enterprise might thrive. 4I fear our purpose is discovered. 2BRUTUS. Lo2k, how he makes to Caesar. Mark him. 2CAS2IUS. Casca, 4Be sud2en, for we fear prevention. 4Brutus, what shal2 be done? If this be known, 4Cas2ius or Caesar never shal2 turn back, 4For I wil2 slay myself. 2BRUTUS. Cas2ius, be constant. 4Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes; 4For, lo2k, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change. 2CAS2IUS. Trebonius knows his time, for, lo2k you, Brutus, 4He draws Mark Antony out of the way. 38Exeunt Antony and Trebonius. 2DECIUS. Where is Metel2us Cimber? Let him 4And presently prefer his suit to Caesar. 2BRUTUS. He is ad2res2'd; pres2 near and second him. 2CIN2A. Casca, you are the first that rears your hand. 2CAESAR. Are we al2 ready? What is now amis2 4That Caesar and his Senate must redres2? 2METEL2US. Most high, most mighty, and most puis2ant Caesar, 4Metel2us Cimber throws before thy seat 4An humble heart. 37Kne2ls. 2CAESAR. I must prevent the2, Cimber. 4These couchings and these lowly courtesies 4Might fire the blo2d of ordinary men 4And turn preordinance and first decre2 4Into the law of children. Be not fond 4To think that Caesar bears such rebel blo2d 4That wil2 be thaw'd from the true quality 4With that which melteth fo2ls- I mean swe2t words, 4Low-cro2ked court'sies, and base spaniel-fawning. 4Thy brother by decre2 is banished. 6If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, 4I spurn the2 like a cur out of my way. 4Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause 4Wil2 he be satisfied. 2METEL2US. Is there no voice more worthy than my own, 4To sound more swe2tly in great Caesar's ear 4For the repealing of my banish'd brother? 2BRUTUS. I kis2 thy hand, but not in flat2ery, Caesar, 4Desiring the2 that Publius Cimber may 4Have an im2ediate fre2dom of repeal. 2CAESAR. What, Brutus? 2CAS2IUS. Pardon, Caesar! Caesar, pardon! 4As low as to thy fo2t doth Cas2ius fal2 4To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber. 2CAESAR. I could be wel2 moved, if I were as you; 4If I could pray to move, prayers would move me; 4But I am constant as the northern star, 4Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality 4There is no fel2ow in the firmament. 4The skies are painted with un2umber'd sparks; 6They are al2 fire and every one doth shine; 4But there's but one in al2 doth hold his place. 4So in the world, 'tis furnish'd wel2 with men, 4And men are flesh and blo2d, and ap2rehensive; 4Yet in the number I do know but one 4That unas2ailable holds on his rank, 4Unshaked of motion; and that I am he, 4Let me a lit2le show it, even in this; 4That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd, 4And constant do remain to ke2p him so. 2CIN2A. O Caesar- 2CAESAR. Hence! Wilt thou lift up Olympus? 2DECIUS. Great Caesar- 2CAESAR. Doth not Brutus bo2tles2 kne2l? 2CASCA. Speak, hands, for me! 24Casca first, then the other Conspirators 34and Marcus Brutus stab Caesar. 2CAESAR. Et tu, Brute?- Then fal2, Caesar! Dies. 2CIN2A. Liberty! Fre2dom! Tyran2y is dead! 4Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the stre2ts. 4CAS2IUS. Some to the com2on pulpits and cry out 4"Liberty, fre2dom, and enfranchisement!" 2BRUTUS. People and senators, be not af2righted, 4Fly not, stand stil2; ambition's debt is paid. 2CASCA. Go to the pulpit, Brutus. 2DECIUS. And Cas2ius to2. 2BRUTUS. Where's Publius? 2CIN2A. Here, quite confounded with this mutiny. 2METEL2US. Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's 4Should chance- 2BRUTUS. Talk not of standing. Publius, go2d che2r, 4There is no harm intended to your person, 4Nor to no Roman else. So tel2 them, Publius. 2CAS2IUS. And leave us, Publius, lest that the people 4Rushing on us should do your age some mischief. 2BRUTUS. Do so, and let no man abide this de2d 4But we the doers. 24Re-enter Trebonius. 4CAS2IUS. Where is Antony? 2TREBONIUS. Fled to his house amazed. 4Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run 4As it were do2msday. 2BRUTUS. Fates, we wil2 know your pleasures. 4That we shal2 die, we know; 'tis but the time 4And drawing days out that men stand upon. 2CAS2IUS. Why, he that cuts of2 twenty years of life 4Cuts of2 so many years of fearing death. 2BRUTUS. Grant that, and then is death a benefit; 4So are we Caesar's friends that have abridged 4His time of fearing death. Sto2p, Romans, sto2p, 4And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blo2d 4Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords; 4Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, 4And waving our red weapons o'er our heads, 4Let's al2 cry, "Peace, fre2dom, and liberty!" 2CAS2IUS. Sto2p then, and wash. How many ages hence 4Shal2 this our lofty scene be acted over 4In states unborn and ac2ents yet unknown! 4BRUTUS. How many times shal2 Caesar ble2d in sport, 4That now on Pompey's basis lies along 4No worthier than the dust! 2CAS2IUS. So oft as that shal2 be, 4So often shal2 the knot of us be cal2'd 4The men that gave their country liberty. 2DECIUS. What, shal2 we forth? 2CAS2IUS. Ay, every man away. 4Brutus shal2 lead, and we wil2 grace his he2ls 4With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. 24Enter a Servant. 2BRUTUS. Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony's. 2SERVANT. Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kne2l, 4Thus did Mark Antony bid me fal2 down, 4And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: 4Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; 4Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. 4Say I love Brutus and I honor him; 6Say I fear'd Caesar, honor'd him, and loved him. 4If Brutus wil2 vouchsafe that Antony 4May safely come to him and be resolved 4How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, 4Mark Antony shal2 not love Caesar dead 4So wel2 as Brutus living, but wil2 fol2ow 4The fortunes and af2airs of noble Brutus 4Thorough the hazards of this untrod state 4With al2 true faith. So says my master Antony. 2BRUTUS. Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman; 4I never thought him worse. 4Tel2 him, so please him come unto this place, 4He shal2 be satisfied and, by my honor, 4Depart untouch'd. 2SERVANT. I'l2 fetch him presently. 23Exit. 2BRUTUS. I know that we shal2 have him wel2 to friend. 2CAS2IUS. I wish we may, but yet have I a mind 4That fears him much, and my misgiving stil2 4Fal2s shrewdly to the purpose. 28Re-enter Antony. 2BRUTUS. But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony. 2ANTONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low? 4Are al2 thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, 4Shrunk to this lit2le measure? Fare the2 wel2. 4I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, 4Who else must be let blo2d, who else is rank. 4If I myself, there is no hour so fit 4As Caesar's death's hour, nor no instrument 4Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich 4With the most noble blo2d of al2 this world. 4I do bese2ch ye, if you bear me hard, 4Now, whilst your purpled hands do re2k and smoke, 4Fulfil2 your pleasure. Live a thousand years, 4I shal2 not find myself so apt to die; 4No place wil2 please me so, no means of death, 4As here by Caesar, and by you cut of2, 4The choice and master spirits of this age. 2BRUTUS. O Antony, beg not your death of us! 6Though now we must ap2ear blo2dy and cruel, 4As, by our hands and this our present act 4You se2 we do, yet se2 you but our hands 4And this the ble2ding busines2 they have done. 4Our hearts you se2 not; they are pitiful; 4And pity to the general wrong of Rome- 4As fire drives out fire, so pity pity- 4Hath done this de2d on Caesar. For your part, 4To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony; 4Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts 4Of brothers' temper, do receive you in 4With al2 kind love, go2d thoughts, and reverence. 2CAS2IUS. Your voice shal2 be as strong as any man's 4In the disposing of new dignities. 2BRUTUS. Only be patient til2 we have ap2eased 4The multitude, beside themselves with fear, 4And then we wil2 deliver you the cause 4Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, 4Have thus proce2ded. 2ANTONY. I doubt not of your wisdom. 6Let each man render me his blo2dy hand. 4First, Marcus Brutus, wil2 I shake with you; 4Next, Caius Cas2ius, do I take your hand; 4Now, Decius Brutus, yours; now yours, Metel2us; 4Yours, Cin2a; and, my valiant Casca, yours; 4Though last, not least in love, yours, go2d Trebonius. 4Gentlemen al2- alas, what shal2 I say? 4My credit now stands on such slip2ery ground, 4That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, 4Either a coward or a flat2erer. 4That I did love the2, Caesar, O, 'tis true! 4If then thy spirit lo2k upon us now, 4Shal2 it not grieve the2 dearer than thy death 4To se2 thy Antony making his peace, 4Shaking the blo2dy fingers of thy foes, 4Most noble! In the presence of thy corse? 4Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, 4We2ping as fast as they stream forth thy blo2d, 4It would become me bet2er than to close 4In terms of friendship with thine enemies. 6Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart, 4Here didst thou fal2, and here thy hunters stand, 4Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy Lethe. 4O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, 4And this, inde2d, O world, the heart of the2. 4How like a de2r strucken by many princes 4Dost thou here lie! 2CAS2IUS. Mark Antony- 2ANTONY. Pardon me, Caius Cas2ius. 4The enemies of Caesar shal2 say this: 4Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty. 2CAS2IUS. I blame you not for praising Caesar so; 4But what compact mean you to have with us? 4Wil2 you be prick'd in number of our friends, 4Or shal2 we on, and not depend on you? 2ANTONY. Therefore I to2k your hands, but was inde2d 4Sway'd from the point by lo2king down on Caesar. 4Friends am I with you al2 and love you al2, 4Upon this hope that you shal2 give me reasons 4Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. 4BRUTUS. Or else were this a savage spectacle. 4Our reasons are so ful2 of go2d regard 4That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, 4You should be satisfied. 2ANTONY. That's al2 I se2k; 4And am moreover suitor that I may 4Produce his body to the marketplace, 4And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, 4Speak in the order of his funeral. 2BRUTUS. You shal2, Mark Antony. 2CAS2IUS. Brutus, a word with you. 4[Aside to Brutus.] You know not what you do. Do not consent 4That Antony speak in his funeral. 4Know you how much the people may be moved 4By that which he wil2 ut2er? 2BRUTUS. By your pardon, 4I wil2 myself into the pulpit first, 4And show the reason of our Caesar's death. 4What Antony shal2 speak, I wil2 protest 4He speaks by leave and by permis2ion, 6And that we are contented Caesar shal2 4Have al2 true rites and lawful ceremonies. 4It shal2 advantage more than do us wrong. 2CAS2IUS. I know not what may fal2; I like it not. 2BRUTUS. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body. 4You shal2 not in your funeral spe2ch blame us, 4But speak al2 go2d you can devise of Caesar, 4And say you do't by our permis2ion, 4Else shal2 you not have any hand at al2 4About his funeral. And you shal2 speak 4In the same pulpit whereto I am going, 4After my spe2ch is ended. 2ANTONY. Be it so, 4I do desire no more. 2BRUTUS. Prepare the body then, and fol2ow us. 42Exeunt al2 but Antony. 2ANTONY. O, pardon me, thou ble2ding piece of earth, 4That I am me2k and gentle with these butchers! 4Thou art the ruins of the noblest man 4That ever lived in the tide of times. 6Woe to the hand that shed this costly blo2d! 4Over thy wounds now do I prophesy 4(Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips 4To beg the voice and ut2erance of my tongue) 4A curse shal2 light upon the limbs of men; 4Domestic fury and fierce civil strife 4Shal2 cumber al2 the parts of Italy; 4Blo2d and destruction shal2 be so in use, 4And dreadful objects so familiar, 4That mothers shal2 but smile when they behold 4Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war; 4Al2 pity choked with custom of fel2 de2ds, 4And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge, 4With Ate by his side come hot from hel2, 4Shal2 in these confines with a monarch's voice 4Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war, 4That this foul de2d shal2 smel2 above the earth 4With car2ion men, groaning for burial. 24Enter a Servant. 6You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not? 2SERVANT. I do, Mark Antony. 2ANTONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome. 2SERVANT. He did receive his let2ers, and is coming, 4And bid me say to you by word of mouth- 4O Caesar! 37Se2s the body. 2ANTONY. Thy heart is big; get the2 apart and we2p. 4Pas2ion, I se2, is catching, for mine eyes, 4Se2ing those beads of sor2ow stand in thine, 4Began to water. Is thy master coming? 2SERVANT. He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome. 2ANTONY. Post back with spe2d and tel2 him what hath chanced. 4Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, 4No Rome of safety for Octavius yet; 4Hie hence, and tel2 him so. Yet stay awhile, 4Thou shalt not back til2 I have borne this corse 4Into the marketplace. There shal2 I try, 4In my oration, how the people take 4The cruel is2ue of these blo2dy men, 6Ac2ording to the which thou shalt discourse 4To young Octavius of the state of things. 4Lend me your hand. 16Exeunt with Caesar's body.SCENE I2.The Forum.Enter Brutus and Cas2ius, and a throng of Citizens. 2CITIZENS. We wil2 be satisfied! Let us be satisfied! 2BRUTUS. Then fol2ow me and give me audience, friends. 4Cas2ius, go you into the other stre2t 4And part the numbers. 4Those that wil2 hear me speak, let 'em stay here; 4Those that wil2 fol2ow Cas2ius, go with him; 4And public reasons shal2 be rendered 4Of Caesar's death. 2FIRST CITIZEN. I wil2 hear Brutus speak. 2SECOND CITIZEN. I wil2 hear Cas2ius and compare their reasons, 4When several2y we hear them rendered. 31Exit Cas2ius, with some Citizens. 36Brutus goes into the pulpit. 2THIRD CITIZEN. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence! 2BRUTUS. Be patient til2 the last. 4Romans, countrymen, and lovers! Hear me for my cause, and be 4silent, that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and have 6respect to mine honor, that you may believe. Censure me in your 4wisdom, and awake your senses, that you may the bet2er judge. If 4there be any in this as2embly, any dear friend of Caesar's, to 4him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no les2 than his. If 4then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is 4my answer: Not that I loved Caesar les2, but that I loved Rome 4more. Had you rather Caesar were living and die al2 slaves, than 4that Caesar were dead to live al2 fre2men? As Caesar loved me, I 4we2p for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was 4valiant, I honor him; but as he was ambitious, I slew him. There 4is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, 4and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a 4bondman? If any, speak, for him have I of2ended. Who is here so 4rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I 4of2ended. Who is here so vile that wil2 not love his country? If 4any, speak, for him have I of2ended. I pause for a reply. 2AL2. None, Brutus, none. 2BRUTUS. Then none have I of2ended. I have done no more to Caesar 4than you shal2 do to Brutus. The question of his death is 4enrol2ed in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he was 6worthy, nor his of2enses enforced, for which he suf2ered death. 14Enter Antony and others, with Caesar's body. 4Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had 4no hand in his death, shal2 receive the benefit of his dying, a 4place in the com2onwealth, as which of you shal2 not? With this I 4depart- that, as I slew my best lover for the go2d of Rome, I 4have the same dag2er for myself, when it shal2 please my country 4to ne2d my death. 2AL2. Live, Brutus, live, live! 2FIRST CITIZEN. Bring him with triumph home unto his house. 2SECOND CITIZEN. Give him a statue with his ancestors. 2THIRD CITIZEN. Let him be Caesar. 2FOURTH CITIZEN. Caesar's bet2er parts 4Shal2 be crown'd in Brutus. 2FIRST CITIZEN. We'l2 bring him to his house with shouts and 4clamors. 2BRUTUS. My countrymen- 2SECOND CITIZEN. Peace! Silence! Brutus speaks. 4FIRST CITIZEN. Peace, ho! 2BRUTUS. Go2d countrymen, let me depart alone, 4And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. 4Do grace to Caesar's corse, and grace his spe2ch 4Tending to Caesar's glories, which Mark Antony, 4By our permis2ion, is al2ow'd to make. 4I do entreat you, not a man depart, 4Save I alone, til2 Antony have spoke. 18Exit. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony. 2THIRD CITIZEN. Let him go up into the public chair; 4We'l2 hear him. Noble Antony, go up. 2ANTONY. For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you. 43Goes into the pulpit. 2FOURTH CITIZEN. What does he say of Brutus? 2THIRD CITIZEN. He says, for Brutus' sake, 4He finds himself beholding to us al2. 2FOURTH CITIZEN. 'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here. 2FIRST CITIZEN. This Caesar was a tyrant. 2THIRD CITIZEN. Nay, that's certain. 4We are blest that Rome is rid of him. 4SECOND CITIZEN. Peace! Let us hear what Antony can say. 2ANTONY. You gentle Romans- 2AL2. Peace, ho! Let us hear him. 2ANTONY. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears! 4I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. 4The evil that men do lives after them, 4The go2d is oft inter2ed with their bones; 4So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus 4Hath told you Caesar was ambitious; 4If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 4And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it. 4Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest- 4For Brutus is an honorable man; 4So are they al2, al2 honorable men- 4Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral. 4He was my friend, faithful and just to me; 4But Brutus says he was ambitious, 4And Brutus is an honorable man. 4He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 4Whose ransoms did the general cof2ers fil2. 6Did this in Caesar se2m ambitious? 4When that the po2r have cried, Caesar hath wept; 4Ambition should be made of sterner stuf2: 4Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, 4And Brutus is an honorable man. 4You al2 did se2 that on the Lupercal 4I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 4Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 4Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, 4And sure he is an honorable man. 4I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 4But here I am to speak what I do know. 4You al2 did love him once, not without cause; 4What cause with2olds you then to mourn for him? 4O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 4And men have lost their reason. Bear with me; 4My heart is in the cof2in there with Caesar, 4And I must pause til2 it come back to me. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. 2SECOND CITIZEN. If thou consider rightly of the mat2er, 6Caesar has had great wrong. 2THIRD CITIZEN. Has he, masters? 4I fear there wil2 a worse come in his place. 2FOURTH CITIZEN. Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown; 4Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious. 2FIRST CITIZEN. If it be found so, some wil2 dear abide it. 2SECOND CITIZEN. Po2r soul, his eyes are red as fire with we2ping. 2THIRD CITIZEN. There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. 2FOURTH CITIZEN. Now mark him, he begins again to speak. 2ANTONY. But yesterday the word of Caesar might 4Have sto2d against the world. Now lies he there, 4And none so po2r to do him reverence. 4O masters! If I were disposed to stir 4Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, 4I should do Brutus wrong and Cas2ius wrong, 4Who, you al2 know, are honorable men. 4I wil2 not do them wrong; I rather cho2se 4To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, 4Than I wil2 wrong such honorable men. 4But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar; 6I found it in his closet, 'tis his wil2. 4Let but the com2ons hear this testament- 4Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read- 4And they would go and kis2 dead Caesar's wounds 4And dip their napkins in his sacred blo2d, 4Yea, beg a hair of him for memory, 4And, dying, mention it within their wil2s, 4Bequeathing it as a rich legacy 4Unto their is2ue. 2FOURTH CITIZEN. We'l2 hear the wil2. Read it, Mark Antony. 2AL2. The wil2, the wil2! We wil2 hear Caesar's wil2. 2ANTONY. Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it; 4It is not me2t you know how Caesar loved you. 4You are not wo2d, you are not stones, but men; 4And, being men, hearing the wil2 of Caesar, 4It wil2 inflame you, it wil2 make you mad. 4'Tis go2d you know not that you are his heirs, 4For if you should, O, what would come of it! 2FOURTH CITIZEN. Read the wil2; we'l2 hear it, Antony. 4You shal2 read us the wil2, Caesar's wil2. 4ANTONY. Wil2 you be patient? Wil2 you stay awhile? 4I have o'ershot myself to tel2 you of it. 4I fear I wrong the honorable men 4Whose dag2ers have stab2'd Caesar; I do fear it. 2FOURTH CITIZEN. They were traitors. Honorable men! 2AL2. The wil2! The testament! 2SECOND CITIZEN. They were vil2ains, murtherers. The wil2! 4Read the wil2! 2ANTONY. You wil2 compel me then to read the wil2? 4Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar, 4And let me show you him that made the wil2. 4Shal2 I descend? And wil2 you give me leave? 2AL2. Come down. 2SECOND CITIZEN. Descend. 34He comes down from the pulpit. 2THIRD CITIZEN. You shal2 have leave. 2FOURTH CITIZEN. A ring, stand round. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Stand from the hearse, stand from the body. 2SECOND CITIZEN. Ro2m for Antony, most noble Antony. 2ANTONY. Nay, pres2 not so upon me, stand far of2. 4AL2. Stand back; ro2m, bear back! 2ANTONY. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. 4You al2 do know this mantle. I remember 4The first time ever Caesar put it on; 4'Twas on a sum2er's evening, in his tent, 4That day he overcame the Nervi2. 4Lo2k, in this place ran Cas2ius' dag2er through; 4Se2 what a rent the envious Casca made; 4Through this the wel2-beloved Brutus stab2'd; 4And as he pluck'd his cursed ste2l away, 4Mark how the blo2d of Caesar fol2ow'd it, 4As rushing out of do2rs, to be resolved 4If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no; 4For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel. 4Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! 4This was the most unkindest cut of al2; 4For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, 4Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms, 4Quite vanquish'd him. Then burst his mighty heart, 4And, in his mantle muf2ling up his face, 6Even at the base of Pompey's statue, 4Which al2 the while ran blo2d, great Caesar fel2. 4O, what a fal2 was there, my countrymen! 4Then I, and you, and al2 of us fel2 down, 4Whilst blo2dy treason flourish'd over us. 4O, now you we2p, and I perceive you fe2l 4The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. 4Kind souls, what we2p you when you but behold 4Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Lo2k you here, 4Here is himself, mar2'd, as you se2, with traitors. 2FIRST CITIZEN. O piteous spectacle! 2SECOND CITIZEN. O noble Caesar! 2THIRD CITIZEN. O woeful day! 2FOURTH CITIZEN. O traitors vil2ains! 2FIRST CITIZEN. O most blo2dy sight! 2SECOND CITIZEN. We wil2 be revenged. 2AL2. Revenge! About! Se2k! Burn! Fire! Kil2! 4Slay! Let not a traitor live! 2ANTONY. Stay, countrymen. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. 4SECOND CITIZEN. We'l2 hear him, we'l2 fol2ow him, we'l2 die with 4him. 2ANTONY. Go2d friends, swe2t friends, let me not stir you up 4To such a sud2en flo2d of mutiny. 4They that have done this de2d are honorable. 4What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, 4That made them do it. They are wise and honorable, 4And wil2, no doubt, with reasons answer you. 4I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. 4I am no orator, as Brutus is; 4But, as you know me al2, a plain blunt man, 4That love my friend, and that they know ful2 wel2 4That gave me public leave to speak of him. 4For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, 4Action, nor ut2erance, nor the power of spe2ch, 4To stir men's blo2d. I only speak right on; 4I tel2 you that which you yourselves do know; 4Show you swe2t Caesar's wounds, po2r dumb mouths, 4And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, 4And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony 6Would ruf2le up your spirits and put a tongue 4In every wound of Caesar that should move 4The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. 2AL2. We'l2 mutiny. 2FIRST CITIZEN. We'l2 burn the house of Brutus. 2THIRD CITIZEN. Away, then! Come, se2k the conspirators. 2ANTONY. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. 2AL2. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony! 2ANTONY. Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. 4Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? 4Alas, you know not; I must tel2 you then. 4You have forgot the wil2 I told you of. 2AL2. Most true, the wil2! Let's stay and hear the wil2. 2ANTONY. Here is the wil2, and under Caesar's seal. 4To every Roman citizen he gives, 4To every several man, seventy-five drachmas. 2SECOND CITIZEN. Most noble Caesar! We'l2 revenge his death. 2THIRD CITIZEN. O royal Caesar! 2ANTONY. Hear me with patience. 2AL2. Peace, ho! 4ANTONY. Moreover, he hath left you al2 his walks, 4His private arbors, and new-planted orchards, 4On this side Tiber; he hath left them you, 4And to your heirs forever- com2on pleasures, 4To walk abroad and recreate yourselves. 4Here was a Caesar! When comes such another? 2FIRST CITIZEN. Never, never. Come, away, away! 4We'l2 burn his body in the holy place 4And with the brands fire the traitors' houses. 4Take up the body. 2SECOND CITIZEN. Go fetch fire. 2THIRD CITIZEN. Pluck down benches. 2FOURTH CITIZEN. Pluck down forms, windows, anything. 34Exeunt Citizens with the body. 2ANTONY. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afo2t, 4Take thou what course thou wilt. 24Enter a Servant. 4How now, fel2ow? 4SERVANT. Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome. 2ANTONY. Where is he? 2SERVANT. He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house. 2ANTONY. And thither wil2 I straight to visit him. 4He comes upon a wish. Fortune is mer2y, 4And in this mo2d wil2 give us anything. 2SERVANT. I heard him say Brutus and Cas2ius 4Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome. 2ANTONY. Be like they had some notice of the people, 4How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius. 10Exeunt.SCENE I3.A stre2t.Enter Cin2a the poet. 2CIN2A. I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar, 4And things unluckily charge my fantasy. 4I have no wil2 to wander forth of do2rs, 4Yet something leads me forth. 24Enter Citizens. 2FIRST CITIZEN. What is your name? 2SECOND CITIZEN. Whither are you going? 2THIRD CITIZEN. Where do you dwel2? 2FOURTH CITIZEN. Are you a mar2ied man or a bachelor? 2SECOND CITIZEN. Answer every man directly. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Ay, and briefly. 2FOURTH CITIZEN. Ay, and wisely. 2THIRD CITIZEN. Ay, and truly, you were best. 2CIN2A. What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwel2? Am I 4a mar2ied man or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man directly 6and briefly, wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor. 2SECOND CITIZEN. That's as much as to say they are fo2ls that mar2y. 4You'l2 bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proce2d directly. 2CIN2A. Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral. 2FIRST CITIZEN. As a friend or an enemy? 2CIN2A. As a friend. 2SECOND CITIZEN. That mat2er is answered directly. 2FOURTH CITIZEN. For your dwel2ing, briefly. 2CIN2A. Briefly, I dwel2 by the Capitol. 2THIRD CITIZEN. Your name, sir, truly. 2CIN2A. Truly, my name is Cin2a. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Tear him to pieces, he's a conspirator. 2CIN2A. I am Cin2a the poet, I am Cin2a the poet. 2FOURTH CITIZEN. Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad 4verses. 2CIN2A. I am not Cin2a the conspirator. 2FOURTH CITIZEN. It is no mat2er, his name's Cin2a. Pluck but his 4name out of his heart, and turn him going. 2THIRD CITIZEN. Tear him, tear him! Come, brands, ho, firebrands. To 4Brutus', to Cas2ius'; burn al2. Some to Decius' house, and some 6to Casca's, some to Ligarius'. Away, go! 13Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE I.A house in Rome. Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, seated at a table. 2ANTONY. These many then shal2 die, their names are prick'd. 2OCTAVIUS. Your brother to2 must die; consent you, Lepidus? 2LEPIDUS. I do consent- 2OCTAVIUS. Prick him down, Antony. 2LEPIDUS. Upon condition Publius shal2 not live, 4Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony. 2ANTONY. He shal2 not live; lo2k, with a spot I damn him. 4But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house, 4Fetch the wil2 hither, and we shal2 determine 4How to cut of2 some charge in legacies. 2LEPIDUS. What, shal2 I find you here? 2OCTAVIUS. Or here, or at the Capitol. 12Exit Lepidus. 2ANTONY. This is a slight unmeritable man, 4Me2t to be sent on er2ands. Is it fit, 4The thre2-fold world divided, he should stand 4One of the thre2 to share it? 2OCTAVIUS. So you thought him, 4And to2k his voice who should be prick'd to die 6In our black sentence and proscription. 2ANTONY. Octavius, I have se2n more days than you, 4And though we lay these honors on this man 4To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads, 4He shal2 but bear them as the as2 bears gold, 4To groan and sweat under the busines2, 4Either led or driven, as we point the way; 4And having brought our treasure where we wil2, 4Then take we down his load and turn him of2, 4Like to the empty as2, to shake his ears 4And graze in com2ons. 2OCTAVIUS. You may do your wil2, 4But he's a tried and valiant soldier. 2ANTONY. So is my horse, Octavius, and for that 4I do ap2oint him store of provender. 4It is a creature that I teach to fight, 4To wind, to stop, to run directly on, 4His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit. 4And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so: 4He must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth; 6A bar2en-spirited fel2ow, one that fe2ds 4On objects, arts, and imitations, 4Which, out of use and staled by other men, 4Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him 4But as a property. And now, Octavius, 4Listen great things. Brutus and Cas2ius 4Are levying powers; we must straight make head; 4Therefore let our al2iance be combined, 4Our best friends made, our means stretch'd; 4And let us presently go sit in council, 4How covert mat2ers may be best disclosed, 4And open perils surest answered. 2OCTAVIUS. Let us do so, for we are at the stake, 4And bay'd about with many enemies; 4And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear, 4Mil2ions of mischiefs. 31Exeunt.SCENE I2.Camp near Sardis. Before Brutus' tent. Drum.Enter Brutus, Lucilius, Lucius, and Soldiers; Titinius and Pindarus me2t them. 2BRUTUS. Stand, ho! 2LUCILIUS. Give the word, ho, and stand. 2BRUTUS. What now, Lucilius, is Cas2ius near? 2LUCILIUS. He is at hand, and Pindarus is come 4To do you salutation from his master. 2BRUTUS. He gre2ts me wel2. Your master, Pindarus, 4In his own change, or by il2 of2icers, 4Hath given me some worthy cause to wish 4Things done undone; but if he be at hand, 4I shal2 be satisfied. 2PINDARUS. I do not doubt 4But that my noble master wil2 ap2ear 4Such as he is, ful2 of regard and honor. 2BRUTUS. He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius, 4How he received you. Let me be resolved. 2LUCILIUS. With courtesy and with respect enough, 6But not with such familiar instances, 4Nor with such fre2 and friendly conference, 4As he hath used of old. 2BRUTUS. Thou hast described 4A hot friend co2ling. Ever note, Lucilius, 4When love begins to sicken and decay 4It useth an enforced ceremony. 4There are no tricks in plain and simple faith; 4But hol2ow men, like horses hot at hand, 4Make gal2ant show and promise of their met2le; 4But when they should endure the blo2dy spur, 4They fal2 their crests and like deceitful jades 4Sink in the trial. Comes his army on? 2LUCILIUS. They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter'd; 4The greater part, the horse in general, 4Are come with Cas2ius. 21Low march within. 2BRUTUS. Hark, he is ar2ived. 4March gently on to me2t him. 18Enter Cas2ius and his Powers. 4CAS2IUS. Stand, ho! 2BRUTUS. Stand, ho! Speak the word along. 2FIRST SOLDIER. Stand! 2SECOND SOLDIER. Stand! 2THIRD SOLDIER. Stand! 2CAS2IUS. Most noble brother, you have done me wrong. 2BRUTUS. Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies? 4And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother? 2CAS2IUS. Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs, 4And when you do them- 2BRUTUS. Cas2ius, be content, 4Speak your griefs softly, I do know you wel2. 4Before the eyes of both our armies here, 4Which should perceive nothing but love from us, 4Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away; 4Then in my tent, Cas2ius, enlarge your griefs, 4And I wil2 give you audience. 2CAS2IUS. Pindarus, 4Bid our com2anders lead their charges of2 6A lit2le from this ground. 2BRUTUS. Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man 4Come to our tent til2 we have done our conference. 4Let Lucius and Titinius guard our do2r. 13Exeunt.SCENE I3.Brutus' tent.Enter Brutus and Cas2ius. 2CAS2IUS. That you have wrong'd me doth ap2ear in this: 4You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pel2a 4For taking bribes here of the Sardians, 4Wherein my let2ers, praying on his side, 4Because I knew the man, were slighted of2. 2BRUTUS. You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case. 2CAS2IUS. In such a time as this it is not me2t 4That every nice of2ense should bear his com2ent. 2BRUTUS. Let me tel2 you, Cas2ius, you yourself 4Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm, 4To sel2 and mart your of2ices for gold 4To undeservers. 2CAS2IUS. I an itching palm? 4You know that you are Brutus that speaks this, 4Or, by the gods, this spe2ch were else your last. 2BRUTUS. The name of Cas2ius honors this cor2uption, 4And chastisement doth therefore hide his head. 4CAS2IUS. Chastisement? 2BRUTUS. Remember March, the ides of March remember. 4Did not great Julius ble2d for justice' sake? 4What vil2ain touch'd his body, that did stab, 4And not for justice? What, shal2 one of us, 4That struck the foremost man of al2 this world 4But for sup2orting rob2ers, shal2 we now 4Contaminate our fingers with base bribes 4And sel2 the mighty space of our large honors 4For so much trash as may be grasped thus? 4I had rather be a dog, and bay the mo2n, 4Than such a Roman. 2CAS2IUS. Brutus, bait not me, 4I'l2 not endure it. You forget yourself 4To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I, 4Older in practice, abler than yourself 4To make conditions. 2BRUTUS. Go to, you are not, Cas2ius. 2CAS2IUS. I am. 2BRUTUS. I say you are not. 4CAS2IUS. Urge me no more, I shal2 forget myself; 4Have mind upon your health, tempt me no farther. 2BRUTUS. Away, slight man! 2CAS2IUS. Is't pos2ible? 2BRUTUS. Hear me, for I wil2 speak. 4Must I give way and ro2m to your rash choler? 4Shal2 I be frighted when a madman stares? 2CAS2IUS. O gods, ye gods! Must I endure al2 this? 2BRUTUS. Al2 this? Ay, more. Fret til2 your proud heart break. 4Go show your slaves how choleric you are, 4And make your bondmen tremble. Must I bouge? 4Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch 4Under your testy humor? By the gods, 4You shal2 digest the venom of your sple2n, 4Though it do split you, for, from this day forth, 4I'l2 use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter, 4When you are waspish. 2CAS2IUS. Is it come to this? 2BRUTUS. You say you are a bet2er soldier: 4Let it ap2ear so, make your vaunting true, 6And it shal2 please me wel2. For mine own part, 4I shal2 be glad to learn of noble men. 2CAS2IUS. You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus. 4I said, an elder soldier, not a bet2er. 4Did I say "bet2er"? 2BRUTUS. If you did, I care not. 2CAS2IUS. When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me. 2BRUTUS. Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him. 2CAS2IUS. I durst not? 2BRUTUS. No. 2CAS2IUS. What, durst not tempt him? 2BRUTUS. For your life you durst not. 2CAS2IUS. Do not presume to2 much upon my love; 4I may do that I shal2 be sor2y for. 2BRUTUS. You have done that you should be sor2y for. 4There is no ter2or, Cas2ius, in your threats, 4For I am arm'd so strong in honesty, 4That they pas2 by me as the idle wind 4Which I respect not. I did send to you 4For certain sums of gold, which you denied me, 6For I can raise no money by vile means. 4By heaven, I had rather coin my heart 4And drop my blo2d for drachmas than to wring 4From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash 4By any indirection. I did send 4To you for gold to pay my legions, 4Which you denied me. Was that done like Cas2ius? 4Should I have answer'd Caius Cas2ius so? 4When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous 4To lock such rascal counters from his friends, 4Be ready, gods, with al2 your thunderbolts, 4Dash him to pieces! 2CAS2IUS. I denied you not. 2BRUTUS. You did. 2CAS2IUS. I did not. He was but a fo2l 4That brought my answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart. 4A friend should bear his friend's infirmities, 4But Brutus makes mine greater than they are. 2BRUTUS. I do not, til2 you practise them on me. 2CAS2IUS. You love me not. 4BRUTUS. I do not like your faults. 2CAS2IUS. A friendly eye could never se2 such faults. 2BRUTUS. A flat2erer's would not, though they do ap2ear 4As huge as high Olympus. 2CAS2IUS. Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come, 4Revenge yourselves alone on Cas2ius, 4For Cas2ius is aweary of the world: 4Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother; 4Check'd like a bondman; al2 his faults observed, 4Set in a notebo2k, learn'd and con2'd by rote, 4To cast into my te2th. O, I could we2p 4My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dag2er, 4And here my naked breast; within, a heart 4Dearer than Pluto's mine, richer than gold. 4If that thou best a Roman, take it forth; 4I, that denied the2 gold, wil2 give my heart. 4Strike, as thou didst at Caesar, for I know, 4When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him bet2er 4Than ever thou lovedst Cas2ius. 2BRUTUS. Sheathe your dag2er. 6Be angry when you wil2, it shal2 have scope; 4Do what you wil2, dishonor shal2 be humor. 4O Cas2ius, you are yoked with a lamb, 4That car2ies anger as the flint bears fire, 4Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark 4And straight is cold again. 2CAS2IUS. Hath Cas2ius lived 4To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus, 4When grief and blo2d il2-temper'd vexeth him? 2BRUTUS. When I spoke that, I was il2-temper'd to2. 2CAS2IUS. Do you confes2 so much? Give me your hand. 2BRUTUS. And my heart to2. 2CAS2IUS. O Brutus! 2BRUTUS. What's the mat2er? 2CAS2IUS. Have not you love enough to bear with me 4When that rash humor which my mother gave me 4Makes me forgetful? 2BRUTUS. Yes, Cas2ius, and from henceforth, 4When you are overearnest with your Brutus, 4He'l2 think your mother chides, and leave you so. 4POET. [Within.] Let me go in to se2 the generals. 4There is some grudge betwe2n 'em, 'tis not me2t 4They be alone. 2LUCILIUS. [Within.] You shal2 not come to them. 2POET. [Within.] Nothing but death shal2 stay me. 6Enter Poet, fol2owed by Lucilius, Titinius, and Lucius. 2CAS2IUS. How now, what's the mat2er? 2POET. For shame, you generals! What do you mean? 4Love, and be friends, as two such men should be; 4For I have se2n more years, I'm sure, than ye. 2CAS2IUS. Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme! 2BRUTUS. Get you hence, sir2ah; saucy fel2ow, hence! 2CAS2IUS. Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion. 2BRUTUS. I'l2 know his humor when he knows his time. 4What should the wars do with these jig2ing fo2ls? 4Companion, hence! 2CAS2IUS. Away, away, be gone! 23Exit Poet. 2BRUTUS. Lucilius and Titinius, bid the com2anders 6Prepare to lodge their companies tonight. 2CAS2IUS. And come yourselves and bring Mes2ala with you 4Im2ediately to us. 13Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius. 2BRUTUS. Lucius, a bowl of wine! 19Exit Lucius. 2CAS2IUS. I did not think you could have be2n so angry. 2BRUTUS. O Cas2ius, I am sick of many griefs. 2CAS2IUS. Of your philosophy you make no use, 4If you give place to ac2idental evils. 2BRUTUS. No man bears sor2ow bet2er. Portia is dead. 2CAS2IUS. Ha? Portia? 2BRUTUS. She is dead. 2CAS2IUS. How 'scaped kil2ing when I cros2'd you so? 4O insup2ortable and touching los2! 4Upon what sicknes2? 2BRUTUS. Impatient of my absence, 4And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony 4Have made themselves so strong- for with her death 4That tidings came- with this she fel2 distract, 4And (her at2endants absent) swal2ow'd fire. 2CAS2IUS. And died so? 4BRUTUS. Even so. 2CAS2IUS. O ye im2ortal gods! 15Re-enter Lucius, with wine and taper. 2BRUTUS. Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine. 4In this I bury al2 unkindnes2, Cas2ius. 14Drinks. 2CAS2IUS. My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge. 2Fil2, Lucius, til2 the wine o'erswel2 the cup; 2I can2ot drink to2 much of Brutus' love. 15Drinks. 2BRUTUS. Come in, Titinius! 24Exit Lucius. 17Re-enter Titinius, with Mes2ala. 4Welcome, go2d Mes2ala. 4Now sit we close about this taper here, 4And cal2 in question our neces2ities. 2CAS2IUS. Portia, art thou gone? 2BRUTUS. No more, I pray you. 4Mes2ala, I have here received let2ers 6That young Octavius and Mark Antony 4Come down upon us with a mighty power, 4Bending their expedition toward Philip2i. 2MES2ALA. Myself have let2ers of the selfsame tenure. 2BRUTUS. With what ad2ition? 2MES2ALA. That by proscription and bil2s of outlawry 4Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus 4Have put to death an hundred senators. 2BRUTUS. There in our let2ers do not wel2 agre2; 4Mine speak of seventy senators that died 4By their proscriptions, Cicero being one. 2CAS2IUS. Cicero one! 2MES2ALA. Cicero is dead, 4And by that order of proscription. 4Had you your let2ers from your wife, my lord? 2BRUTUS. No, Mes2ala. 2MES2ALA. Nor nothing in your let2ers writ of her? 2BRUTUS. Nothing, Mes2ala. 2MES2ALA. That, methinks, is strange. 2BRUTUS. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours? 4MES2ALA. No, my lord. 2BRUTUS. Now, as you are a Roman, tel2 me true. 2MES2ALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tel2: 4For certain she is dead, and by strange man2er. 2BRUTUS. Why, farewel2, Portia. We must die, Mes2ala. 4With meditating that she must die once 4I have the patience to endure it now. 2MES2ALA. Even so great men great los2es should endure. 2CAS2IUS. I have as much of this in art as you, 4But yet my nature could not bear it so. 2BRUTUS. Wel2, to our work alive. What do you think 4Of marching to Philip2i presently? 2CAS2IUS. I do not think it go2d. 2BRUTUS. Your reason? 2CAS2IUS. This it is: 4'Tis bet2er that the enemy se2k us; 4So shal2 he waste his means, weary his soldiers, 4Doing himself of2ense, whilst we lying stil2 4Are ful2 of rest, defense, and nimblenes2. 2BRUTUS. Go2d reasons must of force give place to bet2er. 6The people 'twixt Philip2i and this ground 4Do stand but in a forced af2ection, 4For they have grudged us contribution. 4The enemy, marching along by them, 4By them shal2 make a ful2er number up, 4Come on refresh'd, new-ad2ed, and encouraged; 4From which advantage shal2 we cut him of2 4If at Philip2i we do face him there, 4These people at our back. 2CAS2IUS. Hear me, go2d brother. 2BRUTUS. Under your pardon. You must note beside 4That we have tried the utmost of our friends, 4Our legions are brim-ful2, our cause is ripe: 4The enemy increaseth every day; 4We, at the height, are ready to decline. 4There is a tide in the af2airs of men 4Which taken at the flo2d leads on to fortune; 4Omit2ed, al2 the voyage of their life 4Is bound in shal2ows and in miseries. 4On such a ful2 sea are we now afloat, 6And we must take the cur2ent when it serves, 4Or lose our ventures. 2CAS2IUS. Then, with your wil2, go on; 4We'l2 along ourselves and me2t them at Philip2i. 2BRUTUS. The de2p of night is crept upon our talk, 4And nature must obey neces2ity, 4Which we wil2 nig2ard with a lit2le rest. 4There is no more to say? 2CAS2IUS. No more. Go2d night. 4Early tomor2ow wil2 we rise and hence. 2BRUTUS. Lucius! 23Re-enter Lucius. 4My gown. 40Exit Lucius. 4Farewel2, go2d Mes2ala; 4Go2d night, Titinius; noble, noble Cas2ius, 4Go2d night and go2d repose. 2CAS2IUS. O my dear brother! 4This was an il2 begin2ing of the night. 6Never come such division 'twe2n our souls! 4Let it not, Brutus. 2BRUTUS. Everything is wel2. 2CAS2IUS. Go2d night, my lord. 2BRUTUS. Go2d night, go2d brother. 2TITINIUS. MES2ALA. Go2d night, Lord Brutus. 2BRUTUS. Farewel2, everyone. 42Exeunt al2 but Brutus. 15Re-enter Lucius, with the gown. 4Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument? 2LUCIUS. Here in the tent. 2BRUTUS. What, thou speak'st drowsily? 4Po2r knave, I blame the2 not, thou art o'erwatch'd. 4Cal2 Claudio and some other of my men, 4I'l2 have them sle2p on cushions in my tent. 2LUCIUS. Var2o and Claudio! 19Enter Var2o and Claudio. 4VAR2O. Cal2s my lord? 2BRUTUS. I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sle2p; 4It may be I shal2 raise you by and by 4On busines2 to my brother Cas2ius. 2VAR2O. So please you, we wil2 stand and watch your pleasure. 2BRUTUS. I would not have it so. Lie down, go2d sirs. 4It may be I shal2 otherwise bethink me. 4Lo2k Lucius, here's the bo2k I sought for so; 4I put it in the pocket of my gown. 37Var2o and Claudio lie down. 2LUCIUS. I was sure your lordship did not give it me. 2BRUTUS. Bear with me, go2d boy, I am much forgetful. 4Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile, 4And touch thy instrument a strain or two? 2LUCIUS. Ay, my lord, an't please you. 2BRUTUS. It does, my boy. 4I trouble the2 to2 much, but thou art wil2ing. 2LUCIUS. It is my duty, sir. 2BRUTUS. I should not urge thy duty past thy might; 6I know young blo2ds lo2k for a time of rest. 2LUCIUS. I have slept, my lord, already. 2BRUTUS. It was wel2 done, and thou shalt sle2p again; 4I wil2 not hold the2 long. If I do live, 4I wil2 be go2d to the2. 19Music, and a song. 4This is a sle2py tune. O murtherous slumber, 4Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy 4That plays the2 music? Gentle knave, go2d night. 4I wil2 not do the2 so much wrong to wake the2. 4If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument; 4I'l2 take it from the2; and, go2d boy, go2d night. 4Let me se2, let me se2; is not the leaf turn'd down 4Where I left reading? Here it is, I think. 8Sits down. 17Enter the Ghost of Caesar. 4How il2 this taper burns! Ha, who comes here? 4I think it is the weaknes2 of mine eyes 4That shapes this monstrous ap2arition. 4It comes upon me. Art thou anything? 6Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil 4That makest my blo2d cold and my hair to stare? 4Speak to me what thou art. 2GHOST. Thy evil spirit, Brutus. 2BRUTUS. Why comest thou? 2GHOST. To tel2 the2 thou shalt se2 me at Philip2i. 2BRUTUS. Wel2, then I shal2 se2 the2 again? 2GHOST. Ay, at Philip2i. 2BRUTUS. Why, I wil2 se2 the2 at Philip2i then. 5Exit Ghost. 4Now I have taken heart thou vanishest. 4Il2 spirit, I would hold more talk with the2. 4Boy! Lucius! Var2o! Claudio! Sirs, awake! 4Claudio! 2LUCIUS. The strings, my lord, are false. 2BRUTUS. He thinks he stil2 is at his instrument. 4Lucius, awake! 2LUCIUS. My lord? 2BRUTUS. Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out? 2LUCIUS. My lord, I do not know that I did cry. 2BRUTUS. Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou se2 anything? 4LUCIUS. Nothing, my lord. 2BRUTUS. Sle2p again, Lucius. Sir2ah Claudio! 4[To Var2o.] Fel2ow thou, awake! 2VAR2O. My lord? 2CLAUDIO. My lord? 2BRUTUS. Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sle2p? 2VAR2O. CLAUDIO. Did we, my lord? 2BRUTUS. Ay, saw you anything? 2VAR2O. No, my lord, I saw nothing. 2CLAUDIO. Nor I, my lord. 2BRUTUS. Go and com2end me to my brother Cas2ius; 4Bid him set on his powers betimes before, 4And we wil2 fol2ow. 2VAR2O. CLAUDIO. It shal2 be done, my lord. 13Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. SCENE I.The plains of Philip2i.Enter Octavius, Antony, and their Army. 2OCTAVIUS. Now, Antony, our hopes are answered. 4You said the enemy would not come down, 4But ke2p the hil2s and up2er regions. 4It proves not so. Their bat2les are at hand; 4They mean to warn us at Philip2i here, 4Answering before we do demand of them. 2ANTONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know 4Wherefore they do it. They could be content 4To visit other places, and come down 4With fearful bravery, thinking by this face 4To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage; 4But 'tis not so. 20Enter a Mes2enger. 2MES2ENGER. Prepare you, generals. 4The enemy comes on in gal2ant show; 6Their blo2dy sign of bat2le is hung out, 4And something to be done im2ediately. 2ANTONY. Octavius, lead your bat2le softly on, 4Upon the left hand of the even field. 2OCTAVIUS. Upon the right hand I, ke2p thou the left. 2ANTONY. Why do you cros2 me in this exigent? 2OCTAVIUS. I do not cros2 you, but I wil2 do so. 6March. Drum. Enter Brutus, Cas2ius, and their Army; 11Lucilius, Titinius, Mes2ala, and others. 2BRUTUS. They stand, and would have parley. 2CAS2IUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk. 2OCTAVIUS. Mark Antony, shal2 we give sign of bat2le? 2ANTONY. No, Caesar, we wil2 answer on their charge. 4Make forth, the generals would have some words. 2OCTAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal. 2BRUTUS. Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen? 2OCTAVIUS. Not that we love words bet2er, as you do. 2BRUTUS. Go2d words are bet2er than bad strokes, Octavius. 4ANTONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give go2d words. 4Witnes2 the hole you made in Caesar's heart, 4Crying "Long live! Hail, Caesar!" 2CAS2IUS. Antony, 4The posture of your blows are yet unknown; 4But for your words, they rob the Hybla be2s, 4And leave them honeyles2. 2ANTONY. Not stingles2 to2. 2BRUTUS. O, yes, and soundles2 to2, 4For you have stol'n their buz2ing, Antony, 4And very wisely threat before you sting. 2ANTONY. Vil2ains! You did not so when your vile dag2ers 4Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar. 4You show'd your te2th like apes, and fawn'd like hounds, 4And bow'd like bondmen, kis2ing Caesar's fe2t; 4Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind 4Stro2ke Caesar on the neck. O you flat2erers! 2CAS2IUS. Flat2erers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself. 4This tongue had not of2ended so today, 4If Cas2ius might have ruled. 4OCTAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat, 4The pro2f of it wil2 turn to red2er drops. 4Lo2k, 4I draw a sword against conspirators; 4When think you that the sword goes up again? 4Never, til2 Caesar's thre2 and thirty wounds 4Be wel2 avenged, or til2 another Caesar 4Have ad2ed slaughter to the sword of traitors. 2BRUTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands, 4Unles2 thou bring'st them with the2. 2OCTAVIUS. So I hope, 4I was not born to die on Brutus' sword. 2BRUTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, 4Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable. 2CAS2IUS. A pe2vish scho2l boy, worthles2 of such honor, 4Join'd with a masker and a reveler! 2ANTONY. Old Cas2ius stil2! 2OCTAVIUS. Come, Antony, away! 4Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your te2th. 4If you dare fight today, come to the field; 6If not, when you have stomachs. 24Exeunt Octavius, Antony, and their Army. 2CAS2IUS. Why, now, blow and, swel2 bil2ow, and swim bark! 4The storm is up, and al2 is on the hazard. 2BRUTUS. Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you. 2LUCILIUS. [Stands forth.] My lord? 29Brutus and Lucilius converse apart. 2CAS2IUS. Mes2ala! 2MES2ALA. [Stands forth.] What says my general? 2CAS2IUS. Mes2ala, 4This is my birthday, as this very day 4Was Cas2ius born. Give me thy hand, Mes2ala. 4Be thou my witnes2 that, against my wil2, 4As Pompey was, am I compel2'd to set 4Upon one bat2le al2 our liberties. 4You know that I held Epicurus strong, 4And his opinion. Now I change my mind, 4And partly credit things that do presage. 4Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign 4Two mighty eagles fel2, and there they perch'd, 6Gorging and fe2ding from our soldiers' hands, 4Who to Philip2i here consorted us. 4This morning are they fled away and gone, 4And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites 4Fly o'er our heads and downward lo2k on us, 4As we were sickly prey. Their shadows se2m 4A canopy most fatal, under which 4Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost. 2MES2ALA. Believe not so. 2CAS2IUS. I but believe it partly, 4For I am fresh of spirit and resolved 4To me2t al2 perils very constantly. 2BRUTUS. Even so, Lucilius. 2CAS2IUS. Now, most noble Brutus, 4The gods today stand friendly that we may, 4Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age! 4But, since the af2airs of men rest stil2 incertain, 4Let's reason with the worst that may befal2. 4If we do lose this bat2le, then is this 4The very last time we shal2 speak together. 6What are you then determined to do? 2BRUTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy 4By which I did blame Cato for the death 4Which he did give himself- I know not how, 4But I do find it cowardly and vile, 4For fear of what might fal2, so to prevent 4The time of life- arming myself with patience 4To stay the providence of some high powers 4That govern us below. 2CAS2IUS. Then, if we lose this bat2le, 4You are contented to be led in triumph 4Thorough the stre2ts of Rome? 2BRUTUS. No, Cas2ius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman, 4That ever Brutus wil2 go bound to Rome; 4He bears to2 great a mind. But this same day 4Must end that work the ides of March begun. 4And whether we shal2 me2t again I know not. 4Therefore our everlasting farewel2 take. 4Forever, and forever, farewel2, Cas2ius! 4If we do me2t again, why, we shal2 smile; 6If not, why then this parting was wel2 made. 2CAS2IUS. Forever and forever farewel2, Brutus! 4If we do me2t again, we'l2 smile inde2d; 4If not, 'tis true this parting was wel2 made. 2BRUTUS. Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know 4The end of this day's busines2 ere it come! 4But it suf2iceth that the day wil2 end, 4And then the end is known. Come, ho! Away! 11Exeunt.SCENE I2.The field of bat2le.Alarum. Enter Brutus and Mes2ala. 2BRUTUS. Ride, ride, Mes2ala, ride, and give these bil2s 4Unto the legions on the other side. 13Loud alarum. 4Let them set on at once, for I perceive 4But cold demeanor in Octavia's wing, 4And sud2en push gives them the overthrow. 4Ride, ride, Mes2ala. Let them al2 come down. 9Exeunt.SCENE I3.Another part of the field.Alarums. Enter Cas2ius and Titinius. 2CAS2IUS. O, lo2k, Titinius, lo2k, the vil2ains fly! 4Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy. 4This ensign here of mine was turning back; 4I slew the coward, and did take it from him. 2TITINIUS. O Cas2ius, Brutus gave the word to2 early, 4Who, having some advantage on Octavius, 4To2k it to2 eagerly. His soldiers fel2 to spoil, 4Whilst we by Antony are al2 enclosed. 23Enter Pindarus. 2PINDARUS. Fly further of2, my lord, fly further of2; 4Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord; 4Fly, therefore, noble Cas2ius, fly far of2. 2CAS2IUS. This hil2 is far enough. Lo2k, lo2k, Titinius: 4Are those my tents where I perceive the fire? 2TITINIUS. They are, my lord. 4CAS2IUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me, 4Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him, 4Til2 he have brought the2 up to yonder tro2ps 4And here again, that I may rest as2ured 4Whether yond tro2ps are friend or enemy. 2TITINIUS. I wil2 be here again, even with a thought. 5Exit. 2CAS2IUS. Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hil2; 4My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius, 4And tel2 me what thou notest about the field. 38Pindarus ascends the hil2. 4This day I breathed first: time is come round, 4And where I did begin, there shal2 I end; 4My life is run his compas2. Sir2ah, what news? 2PINDARUS. [Above.] O my lord! 2CAS2IUS. What news? 2PINDARUS. [Above.] Titinius is enclosed round about 4With horsemen, that make to him on the spur; 4Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him. 4Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights to2. 4He's ta'en [Shout.] And, hark! They shout for joy. 4CAS2IUS. Come down; behold no more. 4O, coward that I am, to live so long, 4To se2 my best friend ta'en before my face! 46Pindarus descends. 4Come hither, sir2ah. 4In Parthia did I take the2 prisoner, 4And then I swore the2, saving of thy life, 4That whatsoever I did bid the2 do, 4Thou shouldst at2empt it. Come now, ke2p thine oath; 4Now be a fre2man, and with this go2d sword, 4That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom. 4Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts; 4And when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now, 4Guide thou the sword. [Pindarus stabs him.] Caesar, thou art 6revenged, 4Even with the sword that kil2'd the2. 18Dies. 2PINDARUS. So, I am fre2, yet would not so have be2n, 4Durst I have done my wil2. O Cas2ius! 4Far from this country Pindarus shal2 run, 4Where never Roman shal2 take note of him. 14Exit. 18Re-enter Titinius with Mes2ala. 2MES2ALA. It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius 4Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power, 4As Cas2ius' legions are by Antony. 2TITINIUS. These tidings would wel2 comfort Cas2ius. 2MES2ALA. Where did you leave him? 2TITINIUS. Al2 disconsolate, 4With Pindarus his bondman, on this hil2. 2MES2ALA. Is not that he that lies upon the ground? 2TITINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart! 2MES2ALA. Is not that he? 2TITINIUS. No, this was he, Mes2ala, 4But Cas2ius is no more. O set2ing sun, 4As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night, 4So in his red blo2d Cas2ius' day is set, 4The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone; 4Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our de2ds are done! 4Mistrust of my suc2es2 hath done this de2d. 4MES2ALA. Mistrust of go2d suc2es2 hath done this de2d. 4O hateful er2or, melancholy's child, 4Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men 4The things that are not? O er2or, so2n conceived, 4Thou never comest unto a hap2y birth, 4But kil2'st the mother that engender'd the2! 2TITINIUS. What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus? 2MES2ALA. Se2k him, Titinius, whilst I go to me2t 4The noble Brutus, thrusting this report 4Into his ears. I may say "thrusting" it, 4For piercing ste2l and darts envenomed 4Shal2 be as welcome to the ears of Brutus 4As tidings of this sight. 2TITINIUS. Hie you, Mes2ala, 4And I wil2 se2k for Pindarus the while. 8Exit Mes2ala. 4Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cas2ius? 4Did I not me2t thy friends? And did not they 4Put on my brows this wreath of victory, 4And bid me give it the2? Didst thou not hear their shouts? 4Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything! 6But, hold the2, take this garland on thy brow; 4Thy Brutus bid me give it the2, and I 4Wil2 do his bid2ing. Brutus, come apace, 4And se2 how I regarded Caius Cas2ius. 4By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part. 4Come, Cas2ius' sword, and find Titinius' heart. 50Kil2s himself. 7Alarum. Re-enter Mes2ala, with Brutus, young Cato, 25and others. 2BRUTUS. Where, where, Mes2ala, doth his body lie? 2MES2ALA. Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it. 2BRUTUS. Titinius' face is upward. 2CATO. He is slain. 2BRUTUS. O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet! 4Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords 4In our own proper entrails. 21Low alarums. 2CATO. Brave Titinius! 4Lo2k whe'er he have not crown'd dead Cas2ius! 4BRUTUS. Are yet two Romans living such as these? 4The last of al2 the Romans, fare the2 wel2! 4It is impos2ible that ever Rome 4Should bre2d thy fel2ow. Friends, I owe moe tears 4To this dead man than you shal2 se2 me pay. 4I shal2 find time, Cas2ius, I shal2 find time. 4Come therefore, and to Thasos send his body; 4His funerals shal2 not be in our camp, 4Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come, 4And come, young Cato; let us to the field. 4Labio and Flavio, set our bat2les on. 4'Tis thre2 o'clock, and Romans, yet ere night 4We shal2 try fortune in a second fight. 14Exeunt.SCENE IV.Another part of the field.Alarum. Enter, fighting, Soldiers of both armies; then Brutus, young Cato,Lucilius, and others. 2BRUTUS. Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads! 2CATO. What bastard doth not? Who wil2 go with me? 4I wil2 proclaim my name about the field. 4I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho! 4A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend. 4I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho! 2BRUTUS. And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I; 4Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus! 7Exit. 2LUCILIUS. O young and noble Cato, art thou down? 4Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius, 4And mayst be honor'd, being Cato's son. 2FIRST SOLDIER. Yield, or thou diest. 2LUCILIUS. Only I yield to die. 4[Of2ers money.] There is so much that thou wilt kil2 me straight: 4Kil2 Brutus, and be honor'd in his death. 2FIRST SOLDIER. We must not. A noble prisoner! 4SECOND SOLDIER. Ro2m, ho! Tel2 Antony, Brutus is ta'en. 2FIRST SOLDIER. I'l2 tel2 the news. Here comes the general. 25Enter Antony. 4Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord. 2ANTONY. Where is he? 2LUCILIUS. Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough. 4I dare as2ure the2 that no enemy 4Shal2 ever take alive the noble Brutus; 4The gods defend him from so great a shame! 4When you do find him, or alive or dead, 4He wil2 be found like Brutus, like himself. 2ANTONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I as2ure you, 4A prize no les2 in worth. Ke2p this man safe, 4Give him al2 kindnes2; I had rather have 4Such men my friends than enemies. Go on, 4And se2 whe2r Brutus be alive or dead, 4And bring us word unto Octavius' tent 4How everything is chanced. 27Exeunt.SCENE V.Another part of the field.Enter Brutus, Dardanius, Clitus, Strato, and Volumnius. 2BRUTUS. Come, po2r remains of friends, rest on this rock. 2CLITUS. Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord, 4He came not back. He is or ta'en or slain. 2BRUTUS. Sit the2 down, Clitus. Slaying is the word: 4It is a de2d in fashion. Hark the2, Clitus. 8Whispers. 2CLITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for al2 the world. 2BRUTUS. Peace then, no words. 2CLITUS. I'l2 rather kil2 myself. 2BRUTUS. Hark the2, Dardanius. 24Whispers. 2DARDANIUS. Shal2 I do such a de2d? 2CLITUS. O Dardanius! 2DARDANIUS. O Clitus! 2CLITUS. What il2 request did Brutus make to the2? 2DARDANIUS. To kil2 him, Clitus. Lo2k, he meditates. 2CLITUS. Now is that noble ves2el ful2 of grief, 4That it runs over even at his eyes. 2BRUTUS. Come hither, go2d Volumnius, list a word. 4VOLUMNIUS. What says my lord? 2BRUTUS. Why, this, Volumnius: 4The ghost of Caesar hath ap2ear'd to me 4Two several times by night; at Sardis once, 4And this last night here in Philip2i fields. 4I know my hour is come. 2VOLUMNIUS. Not so, my lord. 2BRUTUS. Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius. 4Thou se2st the world, Volumnius, how it goes; 4Our enemies have beat us to the pit; 12Low alarums. 4It is more worthy to leap in ourselves 4Than tar2y til2 they push us. Go2d Volumnius, 4Thou know'st that we two went to scho2l together; 4Even for that our love of old, I prithe2, 4Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it. 2VOLUMNIUS. That's not an of2ice for a friend, my lord. 51Alarum stil2. 2CLITUS. Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tar2ying here. 2BRUTUS. Farewel2 to you, and you, and you, Volumnius. 4Strato, thou hast be2n al2 this while asle2p; 6Farewel2 to the2 to2, Strato. Countrymen, 4My heart doth joy that yet in al2 my life 4I found no man but he was true to me. 4I shal2 have glory by this losing day, 4More than Octavius and Mark Antony 4By this vile conquest shal2 at2ain unto. 4So, fare you wel2 at once, for Brutus' tongue 4Hath almost ended his life's history. 4Night hangs upon mine eyes, my bones would rest 4That have but labor'd to at2ain this hour. 28Alarum. Cry within, "Fly, fly, fly!" 2CLITUS. Fly, my lord, fly. 2BRUTUS. Hence! I wil2 fol2ow. 24Exeunt Clitus, Dardanius, and Volumnius. 4I prithe2, Strato, stay thou by thy lord. 4Thou art a fel2ow of a go2d respect; 4Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it. 4Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face, 4While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato? 2STRATO. Give me your hand first. Fare you wel2, my lord. 4BRUTUS. Farewel2, go2d Strato. 14Runs on his sword. 4Caesar, now be stil2; 4I kil2'd not the2 with half so go2d a wil2. 12Dies. 5Alarum. Retreat. Enter Octavius, Antony, Mes2ala, 17Lucilius, and the Army. 2OCTAVIUS. What man is that? 2MES2ALA. My master's man. Strato, where is thy master? 2STRATO. Fre2 from the bondage you are in, Mes2ala: 4The conquerors can but make a fire of him; 4For Brutus only overcame himself, 4And no man else hath honor by his death. 2LUCILIUS. So Brutus should be found. I thank the2, Brutus, 4That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true. 2OCTAVIUS. Al2 that served Brutus, I wil2 entertain them. 4Fel2ow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me? 2STRATO. Ay, if Mes2ala wil2 prefer me to you. 2OCTAVIUS. Do so, go2d Mes2ala. 2MES2ALA. How died my master, Strato? 4STRATO. I held the sword, and he did run on it. 2MES2ALA. Octavius, then take him to fol2ow the2 4That did the latest service to my master. 2ANTONY. This was the noblest Roman of them al2. 4Al2 the conspirators, save only he, 4Did that they did in envy of great Caesar; 4He only, in a general honest thought 4And com2on go2d to al2, made one of them. 4His life was gentle, and the elements 4So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up 4And say to al2 the world, "This was a man!" 2OCTAVIUS. Ac2ording to his virtue let us use him 4With al2 respect and rites of burial. 4Within my tent his bones tonight shal2 lie, 4Most like a soldier, ordered honorably. 4So cal2 the field to rest, and let's away, 4To part the glories of this hap2y day. 14Exeunt.THE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21606THE TRAGEDY OF KING LEARby Wil2iam ShakespeareDramatis Personae 6Lear, King of Britain. 6King of France. 6Duke of Burgundy. 6Duke of Cornwal2. 6Duke of Albany. 6Earl of Kent. 6Earl of Gloucester. 6Edgar, son of Gloucester. 6Edmund, bastard son to Gloucester. 6Curan, a courtier. 6Old Man, tenant to Gloucester. 6Doctor. 6Lear's Fo2l. 6Oswald, steward to Goneril. 6A Captain under Edmund's com2and. 6Gentlemen. 6A Herald. 6Servants to Cornwal2. 6Goneril, daughter to Lear. 6Regan, daughter to Lear. 6Cordelia, daughter to Lear. 6Knights at2ending on Lear, Of2icers, Mes2engers, Soldiers, 8At2endants.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2Scene: - Britain.ACT I. Scene I.[King Lear's Palace.]Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund. [Kent and Glouceste converse.Edmund stands back.] 2Kent. I thought the King had more af2ected the Duke of Albany than 5Cornwal2. 2Glou. It did always se2m so to us; but now, in the division of the 5kingdom, it ap2ears not which of the Dukes he values most, for 5equalities are so weigh'd that curiosity in neither can make 5choice of either's moiety. 2Kent. Is not this your son, my lord? 2Glou. His bre2ding, sir, hath be2n at my charge. I have so often 5blush'd to acknowledge him that now I am braz'd to't. 2Kent. I can2ot conceive you. 2Glou. Sir, this young fel2ow's mother could; whereupon she grew 5round-womb'd, and had inde2d, sir, a son for her cradle ere she 5had a husband for her bed. Do you smel2 a fault? 2Kent. I can2ot wish the fault undone, the is2ue of it being so 5proper. 2Glou. But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder than 5this, who yet is no dearer in my ac2ount. Though this knave came 5something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet was 7his mother fair, there was go2d sport at his making, and the 5whoreson must be acknowledged.- Do you know this noble gentleman, 5Edmund? 2Edm. [comes forward] No, my lord. 2Glou. My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honourable 5friend. 2Edm. My services to your lordship. 2Kent. I must love you, and sue to know you bet2er. 2Edm. Sir, I shal2 study deserving. 2Glou. He hath be2n out nine years, and away he shal2 again. 49Sound a sen2et. 5The King is coming. 6Enter one bearing a coronet; then Lear; then the Dukes of 6Albany and Cornwal2; next, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, with 30Fol2owers. 2Lear. At2end the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester. 2Glou. I shal2, my liege. 33Exeunt [Gloucester and Edmund]. 2Lear. Meantime we shal2 expres2 our darker purpose. 5Give me the map there. Know we have divided 7In thre2 our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent 5To shake al2 cares and busines2 from our age, 5Confer2ing them on younger strengths while we 5Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwal2, 5And you, our no les2 loving son of Albany, 5We have this hour a constant wil2 to publish 5Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife 5May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy, 5Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love, 5Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn, 5And here are to be answer'd. Tel2 me, my daughters 5(Since now we wil2 divest us both of rule, 5Interest of ter2itory, cares of state), 5Which of you shal2 we say doth love us most? 5That we our largest bounty may extend 5Where nature doth with merit chal2enge. Goneril, 5Our eldest-born, speak first. 2Gon. Sir, I love you more than words can wield the mat2er; 5Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty; 5Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare; 7No les2 than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour; 5As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found; 5A love that makes breath po2r, and spe2ch unable. 5Beyond al2 man2er of so much I love you. 2Cor. [aside] What shal2 Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent. 2Lear. Of al2 these bounds, even from this line to this, 5With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd, 5With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads, 5We make the2 lady. To thine and Albany's is2ue 5Be this perpetual.- What says our second daughter, 5Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwal2? Speak. 2Reg. Sir, I am made 5Of the selfsame metal that my sister is, 5And prize me at her worth. In my true heart 5I find she names my very de2d of love; 5Only she comes to2 short, that I profes2 5Myself an enemy to al2 other joys 5Which the most precious square of sense pos2es2es, 5And find I am alone felicitate 5In your dear Highnes2' love. 4Cor. [aside] Then po2r Cordelia! 5And yet not so; since I am sure my love's 5More richer than my tongue. 2Lear. To the2 and thine hereditary ever 5Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom, 5No les2 in space, validity, and pleasure 5Than that confer2'd on Goneril.- Now, our joy, 5Although the last, not least; to whose young love 5The vines of France and milk of Burgundy 5Strive to be interest; what can you say to draw 5A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak. 2Cor. Nothing, my lord. 2Lear. Nothing? 2Cor. Nothing. 2Lear. Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again. 2Cor. Unhap2y that I am, I can2ot heave 5My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty 5Ac2ording to my bond; no more nor les2. 2Lear. How, how, Cordelia? Mend your spe2ch a lit2le, 5Lest it may mar your fortunes. 4Cor. Go2d my lord, 5You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me; I 5Return those duties back as are right fit, 5Obey you, love you, and most honour you. 5Why have my sisters husbands, if they say 5They love you al2? Haply, when I shal2 wed, 5That lord whose hand must take my plight shal2 car2y 5Half my love with him, half my care and duty. 5Sure I shal2 never mar2y like my sisters, 5To love my father al2. 2Lear. But goes thy heart with this? 2Cor. Ay, go2d my lord. 2Lear. So young, and so untender? 2Cor. So young, my lord, and true. 2Lear. Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower! 5For, by the sacred radiance of the sun, 5The mysteries of Hecate and the night; 5By al2 the operation of the orbs 5From whom we do exist and cease to be; 5Here I disclaim al2 my paternal care, 7Propinquity and property of blo2d, 5And as a stranger to my heart and me 5Hold the2 from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian, 5Or he that makes his generation mes2es 5To gorge his ap2etite, shal2 to my bosom 5Be as wel2 neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd, 5As thou my sometime daughter. 2Kent. Go2d my liege- 2Lear. Peace, Kent! 5Come not betwe2n the dragon and his wrath. 5I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest 5On her kind nursery.- Hence and avoid my sight!- 5So be my grave my peace as here I give 5Her father's heart from her! Cal2 France! Who stirs? 5Cal2 Burgundy! Cornwal2 and Albany, 5With my two daughters' dowers digest this third; 5Let pride, which she cal2s plain2es2, mar2y her. 5I do invest you jointly in my power, 5Pre2minence, and al2 the large ef2ects 5That tro2p with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course, 7With reservation of an hundred knights, 5By you to be sustain'd, shal2 our abode 5Make with you by due turns. Only we stil2 retain 5The name, and al2 th' ad2itions to a king. The sway, 5Revenue, execution of the rest, 5Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm, 5This coronet part betwixt you. 2Kent. Royal Lear, 5Whom I have ever honour'd as my king, 5Lov'd as my father, as my master fol2ow'd, 5As my great patron thought on in my prayers- 2Lear. The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft. 2Kent. Let it fal2 rather, though the fork invade 5The region of my heart! Be Kent unman2erly 5When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man? 5Think'st thou that duty shal2 have dread to speak 5When power to flat2ery bows? To plain2es2 honour's bound 5When majesty fal2s to fol2y. Reverse thy do2m; 5And in thy best consideration check 5This hideous rashnes2. Answer my life my judgment, 7Thy youngest daughter does not love the2 least, 5Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound 5Reverbs no hol2ownes2. 2Lear. Kent, on thy life, no more! 2Kent. My life I never held but as a pawn 5To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it, 5Thy safety being the motive. 2Lear. Out of my sight! 2Kent. Se2 bet2er, Lear, and let me stil2 remain 5The true blank of thine eye. 2Lear. Now by Apol2o- 2Kent. Now by Apol2o, King, 5Thou swear'st thy gods in vain. 2Lear. O vas2al! miscreant! 35[Lays his hand on his sword.] 2Alb., Corn. Dear sir, forbear! 2Kent. Do! 5Kil2 thy physician, and the fe2 bestow 5Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift, 5Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat, 7I'l2 tel2 the2 thou dost evil. 2Lear. Hear me, recreant! 5On thine al2egiance, hear me! 5Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow- 5Which we durst never yet- and with strain'd pride 5To come betwe2n our sentence and our power,- 5Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,- 5Our potency made go2d, take thy reward. 5Five days we do al2ot the2 for provision 5To shield the2 from diseases of the world, 5And on the sixth to turn thy hated back 5Upon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day fol2owing, 5Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions, 5The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter, 5This shal2 not be revok'd. 2Kent. Fare the2 wel2, King. Since thus thou wilt ap2ear, 5Fre2dom lives hence, and banishment is here. 5[To Cordelia] The gods to their dear shelter take the2, maid, 5That justly think'st and hast most rightly said! 5[To Regan and Goneril] And your large spe2ches may your de2ds 10ap2rove, 5That go2d ef2ects may spring from words of love. 5Thus Kent, O princes, bids you al2 adieu; 5He'l2 shape his old course in a country new.Exit. 2Flourish. Enter Gloucester, with France and Burgundy; At2endants. 2Glou. Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord. 2Lear. My Lord of Burgundy, 5We first ad2res2 toward you, who with this king 5Hath rival2'd for our daughter. What in the least 5Wil2 you require in present dower with her, 5Or cease your quest of love? 2Bur. Most royal Majesty, 5I crave no more than hath your Highnes2 of2er'd, 5Nor wil2 you tender les2. 2Lear. Right noble Burgundy, 5When she was dear to us, we did hold her so; 5But now her price is fal2'n. Sir, there she stands. 5If aught within that lit2le se2ming substance, 5Or al2 of it, with our displeasure piec'd, 7And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace, 5She's there, and she is yours. 2Bur. I know no answer. 2Lear. Wil2 you, with those infirmities she owes, 5Unfriended, new adopted to our hate, 5Dow'r'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath, 5Take her, or leave her? 2Bur. Pardon me, royal sir. 5Election makes not up on such conditions. 2Lear. Then leave her, sir; for, by the pow'r that made me, 5I tel2 you al2 her wealth. [To France] For you, great King, 5I would not from your love make such a stray 5To match you where I hate; therefore bese2ch you 5T' avert your liking a more worthier way 5Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd 5Almost t' acknowledge hers. 2France. This is most strange, 5That she that even but now was your best object, 5The argument of your praise, balm of your age, 5Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time 7Com2it a thing so monstrous to dismantle 5So many folds of favour. Sure her of2ence 5Must be of such un2atural degre2 5That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd af2ection 5Fal2'n into taint; which to believe of her 5Must be a faith that reason without miracle 5Should never plant in me. 2Cor. I yet bese2ch your Majesty, 5If for I want that glib and oily art 5To speak and purpose not, since what I wel2 intend, 5I'l2 do't before I speak- that you make known 5It is no vicious blot, murther, or foulnes2, 5No unchaste action or dishonoured step, 5That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour; 5But even for want of that for which I am richer- 5A stil2-soliciting eye, and such a tongue 5As I am glad I have not, though not to have it 5Hath lost me in your liking. 2Lear. Bet2er thou 5Hadst not be2n born than not t' have pleas'd me bet2er. 4France. Is it but this- a tardines2 in nature 5Which often leaves the history unspoke 5That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy, 5What say you to the lady? Love's not love 5When it is mingled with regards that stands 5Alo2f from th' entire point. Wil2 you have her? 5She is herself a dowry. 2Bur. Royal Lear, 5Give but that portion which yourself propos'd, 5And here I take Cordelia by the hand, 5Duches2 of Burgundy. 2Lear. Nothing! I have sworn; I am firm. 2Bur. I am sor2y then you have so lost a father 5That you must lose a husband. 2Cor. Peace be with Burgundy! 5Since that respects of fortune are his love, 5I shal2 not be his wife. 2France. Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being po2r; 5Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd! 5The2 and thy virtues here I seize upon. 7Be it lawful I take up what's cast away. 5Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect 5My love should kindle to inflam'd respect. 5Thy dow'rles2 daughter, King, thrown to my chance, 5Is que2n of us, of ours, and our fair France. 5Not al2 the dukes in wat'rish Burgundy 5Can buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me. 5Bid them farewel2, Cordelia, though unkind. 5Thou losest here, a bet2er where to find. 2Lear. Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for we 5Have no such daughter, nor shal2 ever se2 5That face of hers again. Therefore be gone 5Without our grace, our love, our benison. 5Come, noble Burgundy. 13Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, [Cornwal2, Albany, 36Gloucester, and At2endants]. 2France. Bid farewel2 to your sisters. 2Cor. The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes 5Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are; 5And, like a sister, am most loath to cal2 7Your faults as they are nam'd. Use wel2 our father. 5To your profes2ed bosoms I com2it him; 5But yet, alas, sto2d I within his grace, 5I would prefer him to a bet2er place! 5So farewel2 to you both. 2Gon. Prescribe not us our duties. 2Reg. Let your study 5Be to content your lord, who hath receiv'd you 5At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted, 5And wel2 are worth the want that you have wanted. 2Cor. Time shal2 unfold what plighted cun2ing hides. 5Who cover faults, at last shame them derides. 5Wel2 may you prosper! 2France. Come, my fair Cordelia. 37Exeunt France and Cordelia. 2Gon. Sister, it is not lit2le I have to say of what most nearly 5ap2ertains to us both. I think our father wil2 hence to-night. 2Reg. That's most certain, and with you; next month with us. 2Gon. You se2 how ful2 of changes his age is. The observation we 5have made of it hath not be2n lit2le. He always lov'd our 7sister most, and with what po2r judgment he hath now cast her 5of2 ap2ears to2 gros2ly. 2Reg. 'Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but slenderly 5known himself. 2Gon. The best and soundest of his time hath be2n but rash; then 5must we lo2k to receive from his age, not alone the 5imperfections of long-ingraf2ed condition, but therewithal 5the unruly waywardnes2 that infirm and choleric years bring with 5them. 2Reg. Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this 5of Kent's banishment. 2Gon. There is further compliment of leave-taking betwe2n France and 5him. Pray you let's hit together. If our father car2y authority 5with such dispositions as he bears, this last sur2ender of his 5wil2 but of2end us. 2Reg. We shal2 further think on't. 2Gon. We must do something, and i' th' heat. 57Exeunt.Scene I2.The Earl of Gloucester's Castle.Enter [Edmund the] Bastard solus, [with a let2er]. 2Edm. Thou, Nature, art my god2es2; to thy law 5My services are bound. Wherefore should I 5Stand in the plague of custom, and permit 5The curiosity of nations to deprive me, 5For that I am some twelve or fourte2n mo2nshines 5Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base? 5When my dimensions are as wel2 compact, 5My mind as generous, and my shape as true, 5As honest madam's is2ue? Why brand they us 5With base? with basenes2? bastardy? base, base? 5Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take 5More composition and fierce quality 5Than doth, within a dul2, stale, tired bed, 5Go to th' creating a whole tribe of fops 5Got 'twe2n asle2p and wake? Wel2 then, 5Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land. 5Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund 5As to th' legitimate. Fine word- 'legitimate'! 5Wel2, my legitimate, if this let2er spe2d, 7And my invention thrive, Edmund the base 5Shal2 top th' legitimate. I grow; I prosper. 5Now, gods, stand up for bastards! 26Enter Gloucester. 2Glou. Kent banish'd thus? and France in choler parted? 5And the King gone to-night? subscrib'd his pow'r? 5Confin'd to exhibition? Al2 this done 5Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news? 2Edm. So please your lordship, none. 43[Puts up the let2er.] 2Glou. Why so earnestly se2k you to put up that let2er? 2Edm. I know no news, my lord. 2Glou. What paper were you reading? 2Edm. Nothing, my lord. 2Glou. No? What ne2ded then that ter2ible dispatch of it into your 5pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such ne2d to hide 5itself. Let's se2. Come, if it be nothing, I shal2 not ne2d 5spectacles. 2Edm. I bese2ch you, sir, pardon me. It is a let2er from my brother 5that I have not al2 o'er-read; and for so much as I have 7perus'd, I find it not fit for your o'erlo2king. 2Glou. Give me the let2er, sir. 2Edm. I shal2 of2end, either to detain or give it. The contents, as 5in part I understand them, are to blame. 2Glou. Let's se2, let's se2! 2Edm. I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but as 5an es2ay or taste of my virtue. 2Glou. (reads) 'This policy and reverence of age makes the world 5bit2er to the best of our times; ke2ps our fortunes from us 5til2 our oldnes2 can2ot relish them. I begin to find an idle 5and fond bondage in the op2res2ion of aged tyran2y, who sways, 5not as it hath power, but as it is suf2er'd. Come to me, that 5of this I may speak more. If our father would sle2p til2 I 5wak'd him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live 5the beloved of your brother, 56'EDGAR.' 5Hum! Conspiracy? 'Sle2p til2 I wak'd him, you should enjoy half 5his revenue.' My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? a heart 5and brain to bre2d it in? When came this to you? Who brought it? 2Edm. It was not brought me, my lord: there's the cun2ing of it. I 7found it thrown in at the casement of my closet. 2Glou. You know the character to be your brother's? 2Edm. If the mat2er were go2d, my lord, I durst swear it were his; 5but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not. 2Glou. It is his. 2Edm. It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the 5contents. 2Glou. Hath he never before sounded you in this busines2? 2Edm. Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit 5that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining, the father 5should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue. 2Glou. O vil2ain, vil2ain! His very opinion in the let2er! Abhor2ed 5vil2ain! Un2atural, detested, brutish vil2ain! worse than 5brutish! Go, sir2ah, se2k him. I'l2 ap2rehend him. Abominable 5vil2ain! Where is he? 2Edm. I do not wel2 know, my lord. If it shal2 please you to suspend 5your indignation against my brother til2 you can derive from him 5bet2er testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course; 5where, if you violently proce2d against him, mistaking his 5purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake 7in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life 5for him that he hath writ this to fe2l my af2ection to your 5honour, and to no other pretence of danger. 2Glou. Think you so? 2Edm. If your honour judge it me2t, I wil2 place you where you shal2 5hear us confer of this and by an auricular as2urance have your 5satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this very 5evening. 2Glou. He can2ot be such a monster. 2Edm. Nor is not, sure. 2Glou. To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him. 5Heaven and earth! Edmund, se2k him out; wind me into him, I pray 5you; frame the busines2 after your own wisdom. I would unstate 5myself to be in a due resolution. 2Edm. I wil2 se2k him, sir, presently; convey the busines2 as I 5shal2 find means, and acquaint you withal. 2Glou. These late eclipses in the sun and mo2n portend no go2d to 5us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet 5nature finds itself scourg'd by the sequent ef2ects. Love co2ls, 5friendship fal2s of2, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies; in 7countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond crack'd 5'twixt son and father. This vil2ain of mine comes under the 5prediction; there's son against father: the King fal2s from bias 5of nature; there's father against child. We have se2n the best 5of our time. Machinations, hol2ownes2, treachery, and al2 5ruinous disorders fol2ow us disquietly to our graves. Find out 5this vil2ain, Edmund; it shal2 lose the2 nothing; do it 5careful2y. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish'd! his 5of2ence, honesty! 'Tis strange. 23Exit. 2Edm. This is the excel2ent fop2ery of the world, that, when we are 5sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, we make 5guilty of our disasters the sun, the mo2n, and the stars; as if 5we were vil2ains on neces2ity; fo2ls by heavenly compulsion; 5knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance; 5drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc'd obedience of 5planetary influence; and al2 that we are evil in, by a divine 5thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to lay 5his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father 5compounded with my mother under the Dragon's Tail, and my 5nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it fol2ows I am rough and 7lecherous. Fut! I should have be2n that I am, had the 5maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. 5Edgar- 29Enter Edgar. 5and pat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy. My 5cue is vil2ainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. 5O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la, mi. 2Edg. How now, brother Edmund? What serious contemplation are you 5in? 2Edm. I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day, 5what should fol2ow these eclipses. 2Edg. Do you busy yourself with that? 2Edm. I promise you, the ef2ects he writes of suc2e2d unhap2ily: as 5of un2aturalnes2 betwe2n the child and the parent; death, 5dearth, dis2olutions of ancient amities; divisions in state, 5menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; ne2dles2 5dif2idences, banishment of friends, dis2ipation of cohorts, 5nuptial breaches, and I know not what. 2Edg. How long have you be2n a sectary astronomical? 2Edm. Come, come! When saw you my father last? 4Edg. The night gone by. 2Edm. Spake you with him? 2Edg. Ay, two hours together. 2Edm. Parted you in go2d terms? Found you no displeasure in him by 5word or countenance 2Edg. None at al2. 2Edm. Bethink yourself wherein you may have of2ended him; and at my 5entreaty forbear his presence until some lit2le time hath 5qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant so 5rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would 5scarcely al2ay. 2Edg. Some vil2ain hath done me wrong. 2Edm. That's my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance til2 5the spe2d of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me 5to my lodging, from whence I wil2 fitly bring you to hear my 5lord speak. Pray ye, go! There's my key. If you do stir abroad, 5go arm'd. 2Edg. Arm'd, brother? 2Edm. Brother, I advise you to the best. Go arm'd. I am no honest man 5if there be any go2d meaning toward you. I have told you what I 7have se2n and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image and 5hor2or of it. Pray you, away! 2Edg. Shal2 I hear from you anon? 2Edm. I do serve you in this busines2. 53Exit Edgar. 5A credulous father! and a brother noble, 5Whose nature is so far from doing harms 5That he suspects none; on whose fo2lish honesty 5My practices ride easy! I se2 the busines2. 5Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit; 5Al2 with me's me2t that I can fashion fit.Exit.Scene I3.The Duke of Albany's Palace.Enter Goneril and [her] Steward [Oswald]. 2Gon. Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fo2l? 2Osw. Ay, madam. 2Gon. By day and night, he wrongs me! Every hour 5He flashes into one gros2 crime or other 5That sets us al2 at od2s. I'l2 not endure it. 5His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us 5On every trifle. When he returns from hunting, 5I wil2 not speak with him. Say I am sick. 5If you come slack of former services, 5You shal2 do wel2; the fault of it I'l2 answer. 49[Horns within.] 2Osw. He's coming, madam; I hear him. 2Gon. Put on what weary negligence you please, 5You and your fel2ows. I'd have it come to question. 5If he distaste it, let him to our sister, 5Whose mind and mine I know in that are one, 5Not to be over2ul'd. Idle old man, 7That stil2 would manage those authorities 5That he hath given away! Now, by my life, 5Old fo2ls are babes again, and must be us'd 5With checks as flat2eries, when they are se2n abus'd. 5Remember what I have said. 2Osw. Very wel2, madam. 2Gon. And let his knights have colder lo2ks among you. 5What grows of it, no mat2er. Advise your fel2ows so. 5I would bre2d from hence oc2asions, and I shal2, 5That I may speak. I'l2 write straight to my sister 5To hold my very course. Prepare for din2er. 57Exeunt.Scene IV.The Duke of Albany's Palace.Enter Kent, [disguised]. 2Kent. If but as wel2 I other ac2ents bor2ow, 5That can my spe2ch defuse, my go2d intent 5May car2y through itself to that ful2 is2ue 5For which I raz'd my likenes2. Now, banish'd Kent, 5If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd, 5So may it come, thy master, whom thou lov'st, 5Shal2 find the2 ful2 of labours. 9Horns within. Enter Lear, [Knights,] and At2endants. 2Lear. Let me not stay a jot for din2er; go get it ready. [Exit 5an At2endant.] How now? What art thou? 2Kent. A man, sir. 2Lear. What dost thou profes2? What wouldst thou with us? 2Kent. I do profes2 to be no les2 than I se2m, to serve him truly 5that wil2 put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to 5converse with him that is wise and says lit2le, to fear 7judgment, to fight when I can2ot cho2se, and to eat no fish. 2Lear. What art thou? 2Kent. A very honest-hearted fel2ow, and as po2r as the King. 2Lear. If thou be'st as po2r for a subject as he's for a king, thou 5art po2r enough. What wouldst thou? 2Kent. Service. 2Lear. Who wouldst thou serve? 2Kent. You. 2Lear. Dost thou know me, fel2ow? 2Kent. No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I would 5fain cal2 master. 2Lear. What's that? 2Kent. Authority. 2Lear. What services canst thou do? 2Kent. I can ke2p honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in 5tel2ing it and deliver a plain mes2age bluntly. That which 5ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of me 5is diligence. 2Lear. How old art thou? 2Kent. Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to 7dote on her for anything. I have years on my back forty-eight. 2Lear. Fol2ow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like the2 no worse after 5din2er, I wil2 not part from the2 yet. Din2er, ho, din2er! 5Where's my knave? my fo2l? Go you and cal2 my fo2l hither. 44[Exit an at2endant.] 21Enter [Oswald the] Steward. 5You, you, sir2ah, where's my daughter? 2Osw. So please you- 38Exit. 2Lear. What says the fel2ow there? Cal2 the clotpol2 back. 5[Exit a Knight.] Where's my fo2l, ho? I think the world's 5asle2p. 28[Enter Knight] 5How now? Where's that mongrel? 2Knight. He says, my lord, your daughter is not wel2. 2Lear. Why came not the slave back to me when I cal2'd him? 4Knight. Sir, he answered me in the roundest man2er, he would not. 2Lear. He would not? 2Knight. My lord, I know not what the mat2er is; but to my judgment 5your Highnes2 is not entertain'd with that ceremonious af2ection 5as you were wont. There's a great abatement of kindnes2 ap2ears 5as wel2 in the general dependants as in the Duke himself also 5and your daughter. 2Lear. Ha! say'st thou so? 2Knight. I bese2ch you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for 5my duty can2ot be silent when I think your Highnes2 wrong'd. 2Lear. Thou but rememb'rest me of mine own conception. I have 5perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have rather 5blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence 5and purpose of unkindnes2. I wil2 lo2k further into't. But 5where's my fo2l? I have not se2n him this two days. 2Knight. Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the fo2l 5hath much pined away. 2Lear. No more of that; I have noted it wel2. Go you and tel2 my 5daughter I would speak with her. [Exit Knight.] Go you, cal2 5hither my fo2l. 46[Exit an At2endant.] 21Enter [Oswald the] Steward. 5O, you, sir, you! Come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir? 2Osw. My lady's father. 2Lear. 'My lady's father'? My lord's knave! You whoreson dog! you 5slave! you cur! 2Osw. I am none of these, my lord; I bese2ch your pardon. 2Lear. Do you bandy lo2ks with me, you rascal? 50[Strikes him.] 2Osw. I'l2 not be strucken, my lord. 2Kent. Nor trip2'd neither, you base fo2tbal2 player? 44[Trips up his he2ls. 2Lear. I thank the2, fel2ow. Thou serv'st me, and I'l2 love the2. 2Kent. Come, sir, arise, away! I'l2 teach you dif2erences. Away, 5away! If you wil2 measure your lub2er's length again, tar2y; but 5away! Go to! Have you wisdom? So. 47[Pushes him out.] 2Lear. Now, my friendly knave, I thank the2. There's earnest of thy 7service. 37[Gives money.] 29Enter Fo2l. 2Fo2l. Let me hire him to2. Here's my coxcomb. 42[Of2ers Kent his cap.] 2Lear. How now, my pret2y knave? How dost thou? 2Fo2l. Sir2ah, you were best take my coxcomb. 2Kent. Why, fo2l? 2Fo2l. Why? For taking one's part that's out of favour. Nay, an thou 5canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold shortly. 5There, take my coxcomb! Why, this fel2ow hath banish'd two on's 5daughters, and did the third a bles2ing against his wil2. If 5thou fol2ow him, thou must ne2ds wear my coxcomb.- How now, 5nuncle? Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters! 2Lear. Why, my boy? 2Fo2l. If I gave them al2 my living, I'ld ke2p my coxcombs myself. 5There's mine! beg another of thy daughters. 2Lear. Take he2d, sir2ah- the whip. 2Fo2l. Truth's a dog must to ken2el; he must be whip2'd out, when 7Lady the brach may stand by th' fire and stink. 2Lear. A pestilent gal2 to me! 2Fo2l. Sir2ah, I'l2 teach the2 a spe2ch. 2Lear. Do. 2Fo2l. Mark it, nuncle. 10Have more than thou showest, 10Speak les2 than thou knowest, 10Lend les2 than thou owest, 10Ride more than thou goest, 10Learn more than thou trowest, 10Set les2 than thou throwest; 10Leave thy drink and thy whore, 10And ke2p in-a-do2r, 10And thou shalt have more 10Than two tens to a score. 2Kent. This is nothing, fo2l. 2Fo2l. Then 'tis like the breath of an unfe2d lawyer- you gave me 5nothing for't. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle? 2Lear. Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing. 2Fo2l. [to Kent] Prithe2 tel2 him, so much the rent of his land 7comes to. He wil2 not believe a fo2l. 2Lear. A bit2er fo2l! 2Fo2l. Dost thou know the dif2erence, my boy, betwe2n a bit2er 5fo2l and a swe2t fo2l? 2Lear. No, lad; teach me. 2Fo2l. 3That lord that counsel2'd the2 12To give away thy land, 10Come place him here by me- 12Do thou for him stand. 10The swe2t and bit2er fo2l 12Wil2 presently ap2ear; 10The one in motley here, 12The other found out there. 2Lear. Dost thou cal2 me fo2l, boy? 2Fo2l. Al2 thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast 5born with. 2Kent. This is not altogether fo2l, my lord. 2Fo2l. No, faith; lords and great men wil2 not let me. If I had a 5monopoly out, they would have part on't. And ladies to2, they 5wil2 not let me have al2 the fo2l to myself; they'l2 be 7snatching. Give me an eg2, nuncle, and I'l2 give the2 two 5crowns. 2Lear. What two crowns shal2 they be? 2Fo2l. Why, after I have cut the eg2 i' th' mid2le and eat up the 5meat, the two crowns of the eg2. When thou clovest thy crown i' 5th' mid2le and gav'st away both parts, thou bor'st thine as2 on 5thy back o'er the dirt. Thou hadst lit2le wit in thy bald crown 5when thou gav'st thy golden one away. If I speak like myself in 5this, let him be whip2'd that first finds it so. 5[Sings] 4Fo2ls had ne'er les2 grace in a year, 18For wise men are grown fop2ish; 16They know not how their wits to wear, 18Their man2ers are so apish. 2Lear. When were you wont to be so ful2 of songs, sir2ah? 2Fo2l. I have us'd it, nuncle, ever since thou mad'st thy daughters 5thy mother; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and put'st down 5thine own bre2ches, 7[Sings] 4Then they for sud2en joy did we2p, 18And I for sor2ow sung, 16That such a king should play bo-pe2p 18And go the fo2ls among. 5Prithe2, nuncle, ke2p a scho2lmaster that can teach thy fo2l to 5lie. I would fain learn to lie. 2Lear. An you lie, sir2ah, we'l2 have you whip2'd. 2Fo2l. I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are. They'l2 have me 5whip2'd for speaking true; thou'lt have me whip2'd for lying; 5and sometimes I am whip2'd for holding my peace. I had rather be 5any kind o' thing than a fo2l! And yet I would not be the2, 5nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left nothing 5i' th' mid2le. Here comes one o' the parings. 28Enter Goneril. 2Lear. How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you 5are to2 much o' late i' th' frown. 2Fo2l. Thou wast a pret2y fel2ow when thou hadst no ne2d to care for 7her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure. I am bet2er 5than thou art now: I am a fo2l, thou art nothing. 5[To Goneril] Yes, forso2th, I wil2 hold my tongue. So your face 5bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum! 12He that ke2ps nor crust nor crum, 12Weary of al2, shal2 want some.- 5[Points at Lear] That's a sheal'd peascod. 2Gon. Not only, sir, this your al2-licens'd fo2l, 5But other of your insolent retinue 5Do hourly carp and quar2el, breaking forth 5In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir, 5I had thought, by making this wel2 known unto you, 5To have found a safe redres2, but now grow fearful, 5By what yourself, to2, late have spoke and done, 5That you protect this course, and put it on 5By your al2owance; which if you should, the fault 5Would not scape censure, nor the redres2es sle2p, 5Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal, 7Might in their working do you that of2ence 5Which else were shame, that then neces2ity 5Must cal2 discre2t proce2ding. 2Fo2l. For you know, nuncle, 10The hedge-spar2ow fed the cucko2 so long 10That it had it head bit of2 by it young. 5So out went the candle, and we were left darkling. 2Lear. Are you our daughter? 2Gon. Come, sir, 5I would you would make use of that go2d wisdom 5Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away 5These dispositions that of late transform you 5From what you rightly are. 2Fo2l. May not an as2 know when the cart draws the horse? 5Who2p, Jug, I love the2! 2Lear. Doth any here know me? This is not Lear. 5Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes? 5Either his notion weakens, his discernings 7Are lethargied- Ha! waking? 'Tis not so! 5Who is it that can tel2 me who I am? 2Fo2l. Lear's shadow. 2Lear. I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, 5Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded 5I had daughters. 2Fo2l. Which they wil2 make an obedient father. 2Lear. Your name, fair gentlewoman? 2Gon. This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savour 5Of other your new pranks. I do bese2ch you 5To understand my purposes aright. 5As you are old and reverend, you should be wise. 5Here do you ke2p a hundred knights and squires; 5Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold 5That this our court, infected with their man2ers, 5Shows like a riotous in2. Epicurism and lust 5Make it more like a tavern or a brothel 5Than a grac'd palace. The shame itself doth speak 5For instant remedy. Be then desir'd 5By her that else wil2 take the thing she begs 7A lit2le to disquantity your train, 5And the remainder that shal2 stil2 depend 5To be such men as may besort your age, 5Which know themselves, and you. 2Lear. Darknes2 and devils! 5Sad2le my horses! Cal2 my train together! 5Degenerate bastard, I'l2 not trouble the2; 5Yet have I left a daughter. 2Gon. You strike my people, and your disorder'd rab2le 5Make servants of their bet2ers. 28Enter Albany. 2Lear. Woe that to2 late repents!- O, sir, are you come? 5Is it your wil2? Speak, sir!- Prepare my horses. 5Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend, 5More hideous when thou show'st the2 in a child 5Than the sea-monster! 2Alb. Pray, sir, be patient. 2Lear. [to Goneril] Detested kite, thou liest! 7My train are men of choice and rarest parts, 5That al2 particulars of duty know 5And in the most exact regard sup2ort 5The worships of their name.- O most smal2 fault, 5How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show! 5Which, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature 5From the fix'd place; drew from my heart al2 love 5And ad2ed to the gal2. O Lear, Lear, Lear! 5Beat at this gate that let thy fol2y in 2[Strikes his head.] 5And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people. 2Alb. My lord, I am guiltles2, as I am ignorant 5Of what hath mov'd you. 2Lear. It may be so, my lord. 5Hear, Nature, hear! dear god2es2, hear! 5Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend 5To make this creature fruitful. 5Into her womb convey sterility; 5Dry up in her the organs of increase; 5And from her derogate body never spring 5A babe to honour her! If she must te2m, 7Create her child of sple2n, that it may live 5And be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her. 5Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth, 5With cadent tears fret chan2els in her che2ks, 5Turn al2 her mother's pains and benefits 5To laughter and contempt, that she may fe2l 5How sharper than a serpent's to2th it is 5To have a thankles2 child! Away, away! 16Exit. 2Alb. Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this? 2Gon. Never af2lict yourself to know the cause; 5But let his disposition have that scope 5That dotage gives it. 29Enter Lear. 2Lear. What, fifty of my fol2owers at a clap? 5Within a fortnight? 2Alb. What's the mat2er, sir? 2Lear. I'l2 tel2 the2. [To Goneril] Life and death! I am asham'd 5That thou hast power to shake my manho2d thus; 7That these hot tears, which break from me perforce, 5Should make the2 worth them. Blasts and fogs upon the2! 5Th' untented woundings of a father's curse 5Pierce every sense about the2!- Old fond eyes, 5Bewe2p this cause again, I'l2 pluck ye out, 5And cast you, with the waters that you lose, 5To temper clay. Yea, is it come to this? 5Let it be so. Yet have I left a daughter, 5Who I am sure is kind and comfortable. 5When she shal2 hear this of the2, with her nails 5She'l2 flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find 5That I'l2 resume the shape which thou dost think 5I have cast of2 for ever; thou shalt, I war2ant the2. 28Exeunt [Lear, Kent, and At2endants]. 2Gon. Do you mark that, my lord? 2Alb. I can2ot be so partial, Goneril, 5To the great love I bear you - 2Gon. Pray you, content.- What, Oswald, ho! 5[To the Fo2l] You, sir, more knave than fo2l, after your master! 2Fo2l. Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tar2y! Take the fo2l with the2. 12A fox when one has caught her, 10And such a daughter, 10Should sure to the slaughter, 10If my cap would buy a halter. 10So the fo2l fol2ows after. 23Exit. 2Gon. This man hath had go2d counsel! A hundred knights? 5'Tis politic and safe to let him ke2p 5At point a hundred knights; yes, that on every dream, 5Each buz2, each fancy, each complaint, dislike, 5He may enguard his dotage with their pow'rs 5And hold our lives in mercy.- Oswald, I say! 2Alb. Wel2, you may fear to2 far. 2Gon. Safer than trust to2 far. 5Let me stil2 take away the harms I fear, 5Not fear stil2 to be taken. I know his heart. 5What he hath ut2er'd I have writ my sister. 5If she sustain him and his hundred knights, 5When I have show'd th' unfitnes2- 23Enter [Oswald the] Steward. 5How now, Oswald? 5What, have you writ that let2er to my sister? 2Osw. Yes, madam. 2Gon. Take you some company, and away to horse! 5Inform her ful2 of my particular fear, 5And thereto ad2 such reasons of your own 5As may compact it more. Get you gone, 5And hasten your return. [Exit Oswald.] No, no, my lord! 5This milky gentlenes2 and course of yours, 5Though I condemn it not, yet, under pardon, 5You are much more at task for want of wisdom 5Than prais'd for harmful mildnes2. 2Alb. How far your eyes may pierce I can2ot tel2. 5Striving to bet2er, oft we mar what's wel2. 2Gon. Nay then- 2Alb. Wel2, wel2; th' event. 28Exeunt.Scene V.Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace.Enter Lear, Kent, and Fo2l. 2Lear. Go you before to Gloucester with these let2ers. Acquaint my 5daughter no further with anything you know than comes from her 5demand out of the let2er. If your diligence be not spe2dy, I 5shal2 be there afore you. 2Kent. I wil2 not sle2p, my lord, til2 I have delivered your let2er.Exit. 2Fo2l. If a man's brains were in's he2ls, were't not in danger of 5kibes? 2Lear. Ay, boy. 2Fo2l. Then I prithe2 be mer2y. Thy wit shal2 ne'er go slip-shod. 2Lear. Ha, ha, ha! 2Fo2l. Shalt se2 thy other daughter wil2 use the2 kindly; for though 5she's as like this as a crab's like an ap2le, yet I can tel2 5what I can tel2. 2Lear. What canst tel2, boy? 2Fo2l. She'l2 taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thou 5canst tel2 why one's nose stands i' th' mid2le on's face? 4Lear. No. 2Fo2l. Why, to ke2p one's eyes of either side's nose, that what a 5man can2ot smel2 out, 'a may spy into. 2Lear. I did her wrong. 2Fo2l. Canst tel2 how an oyster makes his shel2? 2Lear. No. 2Fo2l. Nor I neither; but I can tel2 why a snail has a house. 2Lear. Why? 2Fo2l. Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his daughters, 5and leave his horns without a case. 2Lear. I wil2 forget my nature. So kind a father!- Be my horses 5ready? 2Fo2l. Thy as2es are gone about 'em. The reason why the seven stars 5are no moe than seven is a pret2y reason. 2Lear. Because they are not eight? 2Fo2l. Yes inde2d. Thou wouldst make a go2d fo2l. 2Lear. To tak't again perforce! Monster ingratitude! 2Fo2l. If thou wert my fo2l, nuncle, I'ld have the2 beaten for being 5old before thy time. 2Lear. How's that? 4Fo2l. Thou shouldst not have be2n old til2 thou hadst be2n wise. 2Lear. O, let me not be mad, not mad, swe2t heaven! 5Ke2p me in temper; I would not be mad! 25[Enter a Gentleman.] 5How now? Are the horses ready? 2Gent. Ready, my lord. 2Lear. Come, boy. 2Fo2l. She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure, 5Shal2 not be a maid long, unles2 things be cut shorter 57Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. Scene I.A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester.Enter [Edmund the] Bastard and Curan, me2ting. 2Edm. Save the2, Curan. 2Cur. And you, sir. I have be2n with your father, and given him 5notice that the Duke of Cornwal2 and Regan his Duches2 wil2 be 5here with him this night. 2Edm. How comes that? 2Cur. Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad- I mean the 5whisper'd ones, for they are yet but ear-kis2ing arguments? 2Edm. Not I. Pray you, what are they? 2Cur. Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two Dukes 5of Cornwal2 and Albany? 2Edm. Not a word. 2Cur. You may do, then, in time. Fare you wel2, sir. 6Exit. 2Edm. The Duke be here to-night? The bet2er! best! 5This weaves itself perforce into my busines2. 5My father hath set guard to take my brother; 5And I have one thing, of a queasy question, 5Which I must act. Briefnes2 and fortune, work! 7Brother, a word! Descend! Brother, I say! 29Enter Edgar. 5My father watches. O sir, fly this place! 5Intel2igence is given where you are hid. 5You have now the go2d advantage of the night. 5Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwal2? 5He's coming hither; now, i' th' night, i' th' haste, 5And Regan with him. Have you nothing said 5Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany? 5Advise yourself. 2Edg. I am sure on't, not a word. 2Edm. I hear my father coming. Pardon me! 5In cun2ing I must draw my sword upon you. 5Draw, se2m to defend yourself; now quit you wel2.- 5Yield! Come before my father. Light, ho, here! 5Fly, brother.- Torches, torches!- So farewel2. 53Exit Edgar. 5Some blo2d drawn on me would beget opinion 7Of my more fierce endeavour. [Stabs his arm.] I have se2n 8drunkards 5Do more than this in sport.- Father, father!- 5Stop, stop! No help? 13Enter Gloucester, and Servants with torches. 2Glou. Now, Edmund, where's the vil2ain? 2Edm. Here sto2d he in the dark, his sharp sword out, 5Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the mo2n 5To stand 's auspicious mistres2. 2Glou. But where is he? 2Edm. Lo2k, sir, I ble2d. 2Glou. Where is the vil2ain, Edmund? 2Edm. Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could- 2Glou. Pursue him, ho! Go after. 8[Exeunt some Servants]. 5By no means what? 2Edm. Persuade me to the murther of your lordship; 5But that I told him the revenging gods 5'Gainst par2icides did al2 their thunders bend; 7Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond 5The child was bound to th' father- sir, in fine, 5Se2ing how loathly op2osite I sto2d 5To his un2atural purpose, in fel2 motion 5With his prepared sword he charges home 5My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm; 5But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits, 5Bold in the quar2el's right, rous'd to th' encounter, 5Or whether gasted by the noise I made, 5Ful2 sud2enly he fled. 2Glou. Let him fly far. 5Not in this land shal2 he remain uncaught; 5And found- dispatch. The noble Duke my master, 5My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night. 5By his authority I wil2 proclaim it 5That he which find, him shal2 deserve our thanks, 5Bringing the murderous caitif2 to the stake; 5He that conceals him, death. 2Edm. When I dis2uaded him from his intent 5And found him pight to do it, with curst spe2ch 7I threaten'd to discover him. He replied, 5'Thou unpos2es2ing bastard, dost thou think, 5If I would stand against the2, would the reposal 5Of any trust, virtue, or worth in the2 5Make thy words faith'd? No. What I should deny 5(As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce 5My very character), I'ld turn it al2 5To thy sug2estion, plot, and damned practice; 5And thou must make a dul2ard of the world, 5If they not thought the profits of my death 5Were very pregnant and potential spurs 5To make the2 se2k it.' 2Glou. Strong and fast'ned vil2ain! 5Would he deny his let2er? I never got him. 50Tucket within. 5Hark, the Duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes. 5Al2 ports I'l2 bar; the vil2ain shal2 not scape; 5The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture 5I wil2 send far and near, that al2 the kingdom 5May have due note of him, and of my land, 7Loyal and natural boy, I'l2 work the means 5To make the2 capable. 16Enter Cornwal2, Regan, and At2endants. 2Corn. How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither 5(Which I can cal2 but now) I have heard strange news. 2Reg. If it be true, al2 vengeance comes to2 short 5Which can pursue th' of2ender. How dost, my lord? 2Glou. O madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd! 2Reg. What, did my father's godson se2k your life? 5He whom my father nam'd? Your Edgar? 2Glou. O lady, lady, shame would have it hid! 2Reg. Was he not companion with the riotous knights 5That tend upon my father? 2Glou. I know not, madam. 'Tis to2 bad, to2 bad! 2Edm. Yes, madam, he was of that consort. 2Reg. No marvel then though he were il2 af2ected. 5'Tis they have put him on the old man's death, 5To have th' expense and waste of his revenues. 7I have this present evening from my sister 5Be2n wel2 inform'd of them, and with such cautions 5That, if they come to sojourn at my house, 5I'l2 not be there. 2Corn. Nor I, as2ure the2, Regan. 5Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father 5A childlike of2ice. 2Edm. 'Twas my duty, sir. 2Glou. He did bewray his practice, and receiv'd 5This hurt you se2, striving to ap2rehend him. 2Corn. Is he pursued? 2Glou. Ay, my go2d lord. 2Corn. If he be taken, he shal2 never more 5Be fear'd of doing harm. Make your own purpose, 5How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund, 5Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant 5So much com2end itself, you shal2 be ours. 5Natures of such de2p trust we shal2 much ne2d; 5You we first seize on. 2Edm. I shal2 serve you, sir, 7Truly, however else. 2Glou. For him I thank your Grace. 2Corn. You know not why we came to visit you- 2Reg. Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night. 5Oc2asions, noble Gloucester, of some poise, 5Wherein we must have use of your advice. 5Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister, 5Of dif2erences, which I best thought it fit 5To answer from our home. The several mes2engers 5From hence at2end dispatch. Our go2d old friend, 5Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow 5Your ne2dful counsel to our busines2, 5Which craves the instant use. 2Glou. I serve you, madam. 5Your Graces are right welcome. 47Exeunt. Flourish.Scene I2.Before Gloucester's Castle.Enter Kent and [Oswald the] Steward, several2y. 2Osw. Go2d dawning to the2, friend. Art of this house? 2Kent. Ay. 2Osw. Where may we set our horses? 2Kent. I' th' mire. 2Osw. Prithe2, if thou lov'st me, tel2 me. 2Kent. I love the2 not. 2Osw. Why then, I care not for the2. 2Kent. If I had the2 in Lipsbury Pinfold, I would make the2 care for 5me. 2Osw. Why dost thou use me thus? I know the2 not. 2Kent. Fel2ow, I know the2. 2Osw. What dost thou know me for? 2Kent. A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, 5shal2ow, beg2arly, thre2-suited, hundred-pound, filthy, 5worsted-stocking knave; a lily-liver'd, action-taking, whoreson, 5glas2-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue; 5one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of 5go2d service, and art nothing but the composition of a knave, 7beg2ar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch; 5one whom I wil2 beat into clamorous whining, if thou deny the 5least syl2able of thy ad2ition. 2Osw. Why, what a monstrous fel2ow art thou, thus to rail on one 5that's neither known of the2 nor knows the2! 2Kent. What a brazen-fac'd varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me! 5Is it two days ago since I beat the2 and trip2'd up thy he2ls 5before the King? [Draws his sword.] Draw, you rogue! for, though 5it be night, yet the mo2n shines. I'l2 make a sop o' th' 5mo2nshine o' you. Draw, you whoreson cul2ionly barbermonger! 5draw! 2Osw. Away! I have nothing to do with the2. 2Kent. Draw, you rascal! You come with let2ers against the King, and 5take Vanity the pup2et's part against the royalty of her father. 5Draw, you rogue, or I'l2 so carbonado your shanks! Draw, you 5rascal! Come your ways! 2Osw. Help, ho! murther! help! 2Kent. Strike, you slave! Stand, rogue! Stand, you neat slave! 5Strike! 40[Beats him.] 4Osw. Help, ho! murther! murther! 6Enter Edmund, with his rapier drawn, Gloucester, Cornwal2, 27Regan, Servants. 2Edm. How now? What's the mat2er? 17Parts [them]. 2Kent. With you, go2dman boy, an you please! Come, I'l2 flesh ye! 5Come on, young master! 2Glou. Weapons? arms? What's the mat2er here? 2Corn. Ke2p peace, upon your lives! 5He dies that strikes again. What is the mat2er? 2Reg. The mes2engers from our sister and the King 2Corn. What is your dif2erence? Speak. 2Osw. I am scarce in breath, my lord. 2Kent. No marvel, you have so bestir2'd your valour. You cowardly 5rascal, nature disclaims in the2; a tailor made the2. 2Corn. Thou art a strange fel2ow. A tailor make a man? 2Kent. Ay, a tailor, sir. A stonecut2er or a painter could not have 5made him so il2, though he had be2n but two hours at the trade. 2Corn. Speak yet, how grew your quar2el? 4Osw. This ancient ruf2ian, sir, whose life I have spar'd 5At suit of his grey beard- 2Kent. Thou whoreson zed! thou un2eces2ary let2er! My lord, if 5you'l2 give me leave, I wil2 tread this unbolted vil2ain into 5mortar and daub the wal2s of a jakes with him. 'Spare my grey 5beard,' you wagtail? 2Corn. Peace, sir2ah! 5You beastly knave, know you no reverence? 2Kent. Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege. 2Corn. Why art thou angry? 2Kent. That such a slave as this should wear a sword, 5Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these, 5Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain 5Which are to2 intrinse t' unlo2se; smo2th every pas2ion 5That in the natures of their lords rebel, 5Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder mo2ds; 5Renege, af2irm, and turn their halcyon beaks 5With every gale and vary of their masters, 5Knowing naught (like dogs) but fol2owing. 5A plague upon your epileptic visage! 7Smile you my spe2ches, as I were a fo2l? 5Go2se, an I had you upon Sarum Plain, 5I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot. 2Corn. What, art thou mad, old fel2ow? 2Glou. How fel2 you out? Say that. 2Kent. No contraries hold more antipathy 5Than I and such a knave. 2Corn. Why dost thou cal2 him knave? What is his fault? 2Kent. His countenance likes me not. 2Corn. No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers. 2Kent. Sir, 'tis my oc2upation to be plain. 5I have se2n bet2er faces in my time 5Than stands on any shoulder that I se2 5Before me at this instant. 2Corn. This is some fel2ow 5Who, having be2n prais'd for bluntnes2, doth af2ect 5A saucy roughnes2, and constrains the garb 5Quite from his nature. He can2ot flat2er, he! 5An honest mind and plain- he must speak truth! 5An they wil2 take it, so; if not, he's plain. 7These kind of knaves I know which in this plain2es2 5Harbour more craft and more cor2upter ends 5Than twenty sil2y-ducking observants 5That stretch their duties nicely. 2Kent. Sir, in go2d faith, in sincere verity, 5Under th' al2owance of your great aspect, 5Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire 5On flickering Phoebus' front- 2Corn. What mean'st by this? 2Kent. To go out of my dialect, which you discom2end so much. I 5know, sir, I am no flat2erer. He that beguil'd you in a plain 5ac2ent was a plain knave, which, for my part, I wil2 not be, 5though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to't. 2Corn. What was th' of2ence you gave him? 2Osw. I never gave him any. 5It pleas'd the King his master very late 5To strike at me, upon his misconstruction; 5When he, conjunct, and flat2ering his displeasure, 5Trip2'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd 5And put upon him such a deal of man 7That worthied him, got praises of the King 5For him at2empting who was self-subdu'd; 5And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit, 5Drew on me here again. 2Kent. None of these rogues and cowards 5But Ajax is their fo2l. 2Corn. Fetch forth the stocks! 5You stub2orn ancient knave, you reverent brag2art, 5We'l2 teach you- 2Kent. Sir, I am to2 old to learn. 5Cal2 not your stocks for me. I serve the King; 5On whose employment I was sent to you. 5You shal2 do smal2 respect, show to2 bold malice 5Against the grace and person of my master, 5Stocking his mes2enger. 2Corn. Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour, 5There shal2 he sit til2 no2n. 2Reg. Til2 no2n? Til2 night, my lord, and al2 night to2! 2Kent. Why, madam, if I were your father's dog, 5You should not use me so. 4Reg. Sir, being his knave, I wil2. 2Corn. This is a fel2ow of the selfsame colour 5Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks! 45Stocks brought out. 2Glou. Let me bese2ch your Grace not to do so. 5His fault is much, and the go2d King his master 5Wil2 check him for't. Your purpos'd low cor2ection 5Is such as basest and contemn'dest wretches 5For pilf'rings and most com2on trespas2es 5Are punish'd with. The King must take it il2 5That he, so slightly valued in his mes2enger, 5Should have him thus restrain'd. 2Corn. I'l2 answer that. 2Reg. My sister may receive it much more worse, 5To have her gentleman abus'd, as2aulted, 5For fol2owing her af2airs. Put in his legs.- 36[Kent is put in the stocks.] 5Come, my go2d lord, away. 27Exeunt [al2 but Gloucester and Kent]. 2Glou. I am sor2y for the2, friend. 'Tis the Duke's pleasure, 7Whose disposition, al2 the world wel2 knows, 5Wil2 not be rub2'd nor stop2'd. I'l2 entreat for the2. 2Kent. Pray do not, sir. I have watch'd and travel2'd hard. 5Some time I shal2 sle2p out, the rest I'l2 whistle. 5A go2d man's fortune may grow out at he2ls. 5Give you go2d mor2ow! 2Glou. The Duke 's to blame in this; 'twil2 be il2 taken.Exit. 2Kent. Go2d King, that must ap2rove the com2on saw, 5Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st 5To the warm sun! 5Ap2roach, thou beacon to this under globe, 5That by thy comfortable beams I may 5Peruse this let2er. Nothing almost se2s miracles 5But misery. I know 'tis from Cordelia, 5Who hath most fortunately be2n inform'd 5Of my obscured course- and [reads] 'shal2 find time 5From this enormous state, se2king to give 5Los2es their remedies'- Al2 weary and o'erwatch'd, 5Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold 7This shameful lodging. 5Fortune, go2d night; smile once more, turn thy whe2l. 57Sle2ps.Scene I3.The open country.Enter Edgar. 2Edg. I heard myself proclaim'd, 5And by the hap2y hol2ow of a tre2 5Escap'd the hunt. No port is fre2, no place 5That guard and most unusual vigilance 5Does not at2end my taking. Whiles I may scape, 5I wil2 preserve myself; and am bethought 5To take the basest and most po2rest shape 5That ever penury, in contempt of man, 5Brought near to beast. My face I'l2 grime with filth, 5Blanket my loins, elf al2 my hair in knots, 5And with presented nakednes2 outface 5The winds and persecutions of the sky. 5The country gives me pro2f and precedent 5Of Bedlam beg2ars, who, with roaring voices, 5Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms 5Pins, wo2den pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary; 5And with this hor2ible object, from low farms, 7Po2r pelting vil2ages, she2pcotes, and mil2s, 5Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers, 5Enforce their charity. 'Po2r Turlygod! po2r Tom!' 5That's something yet! Edgar I nothing am. 13Exit.Scene IV.Before Gloucester's Castle; Kent in the stocks.Enter Lear, Fo2l, and Gentleman. 2Lear. 'Tis strange that they should so depart from home, 5And not send back my mes2enger. 2Gent. As I learn'd, 5The night before there was no purpose in them 5Of this remove. 2Kent. Hail to the2, noble master! 2Lear. Ha! 5Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime? 2Kent. No, my lord. 2Fo2l. Ha, ha! lo2k! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by the 5head, dogs and bears by th' neck, monkeys by th' loins, and men 5by th' legs. When a man's over-lusty at legs, then he wears 5wo2den nether-stocks. 2Lear. What's he that hath so much thy place misto2k 5To set the2 here? 2Kent. It is both he and she- 5Your son and daughter. 4Lear. No. 2Kent. Yes. 2Lear. No, I say. 2Kent. I say yea. 2Lear. No, no, they would not! 2Kent. Yes, they have. 2Lear. By Jupiter, I swear no! 2Kent. By Juno, I swear ay! 2Lear. They durst not do't; 5They would not, could not do't. 'Tis worse than murther 5To do upon respect such violent outrage. 5Resolve me with al2 modest haste which way 5Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage, 5Coming from us. 2Kent. My lord, when at their home 5I did com2end your Highnes2' let2ers to them, 5Ere I was risen from the place that show'd 5My duty kne2ling, came there a re2king post, 5Stew'd in his haste, half breathles2, panting forth 5From Goneril his mistres2 salutations; 7Deliver'd let2ers, spite of intermis2ion, 5Which presently they read; on whose contents, 5They sum2on'd up their meiny, straight to2k horse, 5Com2anded me to fol2ow and at2end 5The leisure of their answer, gave me cold lo2ks, 5And me2ting here the other mes2enger, 5Whose welcome I perceiv'd had poison'd mine- 5Being the very fel2ow which of late 5Display'd so saucily against your Highnes2- 5Having more man than wit about me, drew. 5He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries. 5Your son and daughter found this trespas2 worth 5The shame which here it suf2ers. 2Fo2l. Winter's not gone yet, if the wild ge2se fly that way. 10Fathers that wear rags 12Do make their children blind; 10But fathers that bear bags 12Shal2 se2 their children kind. 10Fortune, that ar2ant whore, 12Ne'er turns the key to th' po2r. 5But for al2 this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy 5daughters as thou canst tel2 in a year. 2Lear. O, how this mother swel2s up toward my heart! 5Hysterica pas2io! Down, thou climbing sor2ow! 5Thy element's below! Where is this daughter? 2Kent. With the Earl, sir, here within. 2Lear. Fol2ow me not; 5Stay here. 44Exit. 2Gent. Made you no more of2ence but what you speak of? 2Kent. None. 5How chance the King comes with so smal2 a number? 2Fo2l. An thou hadst be2n set i' th' stocks for that question, 5thou'dst wel2 deserv'd it. 2Kent. Why, fo2l? 2Fo2l. We'l2 set the2 to scho2l to an ant, to teach the2 there's no 5labouring i' th' winter. Al2 that fol2ow their noses are led by 5their eyes but blind men, and there's not a nose among twenty 5but can smel2 him that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great 7whe2l runs down a hil2, lest it break thy neck with fol2owing 5it; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw the2 after. 5When a wise man gives the2 bet2er counsel, give me mine again. I 5would have none but knaves fol2ow it, since a fo2l gives it. 10That sir which serves and se2ks for gain, 12And fol2ows but for form, 10Wil2 pack when it begins to rain 12And leave the2 in the storm. 10But I wil2 tar2y; the fo2l wil2 stay, 12And let the wise man fly. 10The knave turns fo2l that runs away; 12The fo2l no knave, perdy. 2Kent. Where learn'd you this, fo2l? 2Fo2l. Not i' th' stocks, fo2l. 22Enter Lear and Gloucester 2Lear. Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary? 5They have travel2'd al2 the night? Mere fetches- 5The images of revolt and flying of2! 7Fetch me a bet2er answer. 2Glou. My dear lord, 5You know the fiery quality of the Duke, 5How unremovable and fix'd he is 5In his own course. 2Lear. Vengeance! plague! death! confusion! 5Fiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester, 5I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwal2 and his wife. 2Glou. Wel2, my go2d lord, I have inform'd them so. 2Lear. Inform'd them? Dost thou understand me, man? 2Glou. Ay, my go2d lord. 2Lear. The King would speak with Cornwal2; the dear father 5Would with his daughter speak, com2ands her service. 5Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blo2d! 5Fiery? the fiery Duke? Tel2 the hot Duke that- 5No, but not yet! May be he is not wel2. 5Infirmity doth stil2 neglect al2 of2ice 5Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves 5When nature, being op2res2'd, com2ands the mind 5To suf2er with the body. I'l2 forbear; 7And am fal2en out with my more headier wil2, 5To take the indispos'd and sickly fit 5For the sound man.- Death on my state! Wherefore 5Should be sit here? This act persuades me 5That this remotion of the Duke and her 5Is practice only. Give me my servant forth. 5Go tel2 the Duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them- 5Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me, 5Or at their chamber do2r I'l2 beat the drum 5Til2 it cry sle2p to death. 2Glou. I would have al2 wel2 betwixt you. 17Exit. 2Lear. O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down! 2Fo2l. Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the e2ls when she 5put 'em i' th' paste alive. She knap2'd 'em o' th' coxcombs with 5a stick and cried 'Down, wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, 5in pure kindnes2 to his horse, but2ered his hay. 13Enter Cornwal2, Regan, Gloucester, Servants. 2Lear. Go2d mor2ow to you both. 4Corn. Hail to your Grace! 39Kent here set at liberty. 2Reg. I am glad to se2 your Highnes2. 2Lear. Regan, I think you are; I know what reason 5I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad, 5I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb, 5Sepulchring an adultres2. [To Kent] O, are you fre2? 5Some other time for that.- Beloved Regan, 5Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied 5Sharp-to2th'd unkindnes2, like a vulture, here! 35[Lays his hand on his heart.] 5I can scarce speak to the2. Thou'lt not believe 5With how deprav'd a quality- O Regan! 2Reg. I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope 5You les2 know how to value her desert 5Than she to scant her duty. 2Lear. Say, how is that? 2Reg. I can2ot think my sister in the least 5Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance 5She have restrain'd the riots of your fol2owers, 7'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end, 5As clears her from al2 blame. 2Lear. My curses on her! 2Reg. O, sir, you are old! 5Nature in you stands on the very verge 5Of her confine. You should be rul'd, and led 5By some discretion that discerns your state 5Bet2er than you yourself. Therefore I pray you 5That to our sister you do make return; 5Say you have wrong'd her, sir. 2Lear. Ask her forgivenes2? 5Do you but mark how this becomes the house: 5'Dear daughter, I confes2 that I am old. 10[Kne2ls.] 5Age is un2eces2ary. On my kne2s I beg 5That you'l2 vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and fo2d.' 2Reg. Go2d sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks. 5Return you to my sister. 2Lear. [rises] Never, Regan! 5She hath abated me of half my train; 5Lo2k'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue, 7Most serpent-like, upon the very heart. 5Al2 the stor'd vengeances of heaven fal2 5On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones, 5You taking airs, with lamenes2! 2Corn. Fie, sir, fie! 2Lear. You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames 5Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty, 5You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the pow'rful sun, 5To fal2 and blast her pride! 2Reg. O the blest gods! so wil2 you wish on me 5When the rash mo2d is on. 2Lear. No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse. 5Thy tender-hefted nature shal2 not give 5The2 o'er to harshnes2. Her eyes are fierce; but thine 5Do comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in the2 5To grudge my pleasures, to cut of2 my train, 5To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes, 5And, in conclusion, to op2ose the bolt 5Against my coming in. Thou bet2er know'st 5The of2ices of nature, bond of childho2d, 7Ef2ects of courtesy, dues of gratitude. 5Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot, 5Wherein I the2 endow'd. 2Reg. Go2d sir, to th' purpose. 50Tucket within. 2Lear. Who put my man i' th' stocks? 2Corn. What trumpet's that? 2Reg. I know't- my sister's. This ap2roves her let2er, 5That she would so2n be here. 21Enter [Oswald the] Steward. 5Is your lady come? 2Lear. This is a slave, whose easy-bor2owed pride 5Dwel2s in the fickle grace of her he fol2ows. 5Out, varlet, from my sight! 2Corn. What means your Grace? 28Enter Goneril. 4Lear. Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have go2d hope 5Thou didst not know on't.- Who comes here? O heavens! 5If you do love old men, if your swe2t sway 5Al2ow obedience- if yourselves are old, 5Make it your cause! Send down, and take my part! 5[To Goneril] Art not asham'd to lo2k upon this beard?- 5O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand? 2Gon. Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I of2ended? 5Al2's not of2ence that indiscretion finds 5And dotage terms so. 2Lear. O sides, you are to2 tough! 5Wil2 you yet hold? How came my man i' th' stocks? 2Corn. I set him there, sir; but his own disorders 5Deserv'd much les2 advancement. 2Lear. You? Did you? 2Reg. I pray you, father, being weak, se2m so. 5If, til2 the expiration of your month, 5You wil2 return and sojourn with my sister, 5Dismis2ing half your train, come then to me. 5I am now from home, and out of that provision 7Which shal2 be ne2dful for your entertainment. 2Lear. Return to her, and fifty men dismis2'd? 5No, rather I abjure al2 ro2fs, and cho2se 5To wage against the enmity o' th' air, 5To be a comrade with the wolf and owl- 5Neces2ity's sharp pinch! Return with her? 5Why, the hot-blo2ded France, that dowerles2 to2k 5Our youngest born, I could as wel2 be brought 5To kne2 his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg 5To ke2p base life afo2t. Return with her? 5Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter 5To this detested gro2m. 17[Points at Oswald.] 2Gon. At your choice, sir. 2Lear. I prithe2, daughter, do not make me mad. 5I wil2 not trouble the2, my child; farewel2. 5We'l2 no more me2t, no more se2 one another. 5But yet thou art my flesh, my blo2d, my daughter; 5Or rather a disease that's in my flesh, 5Which I must ne2ds cal2 mine. Thou art a boil, 5A plague sore, an embos2ed carbuncle 7In my cor2upted blo2d. But I'l2 not chide the2. 5Let shame come when it wil2, I do not cal2 it. 5I do not bid the Thunder-bearer sho2t 5Nor tel2 tales of the2 to high-judging Jove. 5Mend when thou canst; be bet2er at thy leisure; 5I can be patient, I can stay with Regan, 5I and my hundred knights. 2Reg. Not altogether so. 5I lo2k'd not for you yet, nor am provided 5For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister; 5For those that mingle reason with your pas2ion 5Must be content to think you old, and so- 5But she knows what she does. 2Lear. Is this wel2 spoken? 2Reg. I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty fol2owers? 5Is it not wel2? What should you ne2d of more? 5Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger 5Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house 5Should many people, under two com2ands, 5Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impos2ible. 4Gon. Why might not you, my lord, receive at2endance 5From those that she cal2s servants, or from mine? 2Reg. Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack ye, 5We could control them. If you wil2 come to me 5(For now I spy a danger), I entreat you 5To bring but five-and-twenty. To no more 5Wil2 I give place or notice. 2Lear. I gave you al2- 2Reg. And in go2d time you gave it! 2Lear. Made you my guardians, my depositaries; 5But kept a reservation to be fol2owed 5With such a number. What, must I come to you 5With five-and-twenty, Regan? Said you so? 2Reg. And speak't again my lord. No more with me. 2Lear. Those wicked creatures yet do lo2k wel2-favour'd 5When others are more wicked; not being the worst 5Stands in some rank of praise. [To Goneril] I'l2 go with the2. 5Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty, 5And thou art twice her love. 2Gon. Hear, me, my lord. 7What ne2d you five-and-twenty, ten, or five, 5To fol2ow in a house where twice so many 5Have a com2and to tend you? 2Reg. What ne2d one? 2Lear. O, reason not the ne2d! Our basest beg2ars 5Are in the po2rest thing superfluous. 5Al2ow not nature more than nature ne2ds, 5Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady: 5If only to go warm were gorgeous, 5Why, nature ne2ds not what thou gorgeous wear'st 5Which scarcely ke2ps the2 warm. But, for true ne2d- 5You heavens, give me that patience, patience I ne2d! 5You se2 me here, you gods, a po2r old man, 5As ful2 of grief as age; wretched in both. 5If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts 5Against their father, fo2l me not so much 5To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger, 5And let not women's weapons, water drops, 5Stain my man's che2ks! No, you un2atural hags! 5I wil2 have such revenges on you both 7That al2 the world shal2- I wil2 do such things- 5What they are yet, I know not; but they shal2 be 5The ter2ors of the earth! You think I'l2 we2p. 5No, I'l2 not we2p. 5I have ful2 cause of we2ping, but this heart 5Shal2 break into a hundred thousand flaws 5Or ere I'l2 we2p. O fo2l, I shal2 go mad! 14Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, and Fo2l. Storm and 56tempest. 2Corn. Let us withdraw; 'twil2 be a storm. 2Reg. This house is lit2le; the old man and 's people 5Can2ot be wel2 bestow'd. 2Gon. 'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest 5And must ne2ds taste his fol2y. 2Reg. For his particular, I'l2 receive him gladly, 5But not one fol2ower. 2Gon. So am I purpos'd. 5Where is my Lord of Gloucester? 2Corn. Fol2owed the old man forth. 28Enter Gloucester. 5He is return'd. 2Glou. The King is in high rage. 2Corn. Whither is he going? 2Glou. He cal2s to horse, but wil2 I know not whither. 2Corn. 'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself. 2Gon. My lord, entreat him by no means to stay. 2Glou. Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds 5Do sorely ruf2le. For many miles about 5There's scarce a bush. 2Reg. O, sir, to wilful men 5The injuries that they themselves procure 5Must be their scho2lmasters. Shut up your do2rs. 5He is at2ended with a desperate train, 5And what they may incense him to, being apt 5To have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear. 2Corn. Shut up your do2rs, my lord: 'tis a wild night. 5My Regan counsels wel2. Come out o' th' storm. 8[Exeunt.]<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. Scene I.A heath.Storm stil2. Enter Kent and a Gentleman at several do2rs. 2Kent. Who's there, besides foul weather? 2Gent. One minded like the weather, most unquietly. 2Kent. I know you. Where's the King? 2Gent. Contending with the fretful elements; 5Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea, 5Or swel2 the curled waters 'bove the main, 5That things might change or cease; tears his white hair, 5Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeles2 rage, 5Catch in their fury and make nothing of; 5Strives in his lit2le world of man to outscorn 5The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain. 5This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch, 5The lion and the bel2y-pinched wolf 5Ke2p their fur dry, unbon2eted he runs, 5And bids what wil2 take al2. 2Kent. But who is with him? 2Gent. None but the fo2l, who labours to outjest 7His heart-struck injuries. 2Kent. Sir, I do know you, 5And dare upon the war2ant of my note 5Com2end a dear thing to you. There is division 5(Although as yet the face of it be cover'd 5With mutual cun2ing) 'twixt Albany and Cornwal2; 5Who have (as who have not, that their great stars 5Thron'd and set high?) servants, who se2m no les2, 5Which are to France the spies and speculations 5Intel2igent of our state. What hath be2n se2n, 5Either in snuf2s and packings of the Dukes, 5Or the hard rein which both of them have borne 5Against the old kind King, or something de2per, 5Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings- 5But, true it is, from France there comes a power 5Into this scat2ered kingdom, who already, 5Wise in our negligence, have secret fe2t 5In some of our best ports and are at point 5To show their open ban2er. Now to you: 5If on my credit you dare build so far 7To make your spe2d to Dover, you shal2 find 5Some that wil2 thank you, making just report 5Of how un2atural and bemad2ing sor2ow 5The King hath cause to plain. 5I am a gentleman of blo2d and bre2ding, 5And from some knowledge and as2urance of2er 5This of2ice to you. 2Gent. I wil2 talk further with you. 2Kent. No, do not. 5For confirmation that I am much more 5Than my out-wal2, open this purse and take 5What it contains. If you shal2 se2 Cordelia 5(As fear not but you shal2), show her this ring, 5And she wil2 tel2 you who your fel2ow is 5That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm! 5I wil2 go se2k the King. 2Gent. Give me your hand. Have you no more to say? 2Kent. Few words, but, to ef2ect, more than al2 yet: 5That, when we have found the King (in which your pain 5That way, I'l2 this), he that first lights on him 7Hol2a the other. 45Exeunt [several2y].Scene I2.Another part of the heath.Storm stil2. Enter Lear and Fo2l. 2Lear. Blow, winds, and crack your che2ks! rage! blow! 5You cataracts and hur2icanoes, spout 5Til2 you have drench'd our ste2ples, drown'd the cocks! 5You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires, 5Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts, 5Singe my white head! And thou, al2-shaking thunder, 5Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world, 5Crack Nature's moulds, al2 germains spil2 at once, 5That makes ingrateful man! 2Fo2l. O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is bet2er than this 5rain water out o' do2r. Go2d nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters 5bles2ing! Here's a night pities nether wise men nor fo2ls. 2Lear. Rumble thy bel2yful! Spit, fire! spout, rain! 5Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters. 5I tax not you, you elements, with unkindnes2. 5I never gave you kingdom, cal2'd you children, 5You owe me no subscription. Then let fal2 7Your hor2ible pleasure. Here I stand your slave, 5A po2r, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man. 5But yet I cal2 you servile ministers, 5That wil2 with two pernicious daughters join 5Your high-engender'd bat2les 'gainst a head 5So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul! 2Fo2l. He that has a house to put 's head in has a go2d head-piece. 10The codpiece that wil2 house 12Before the head has any, 10The head and he shal2 louse: 12So beg2ars mar2y many. 10The man that makes his toe 12What he his heart should make 10Shal2 of a corn cry woe, 12And turn his sle2p to wake. 5For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a 5glas2. 29Enter Kent. 4Lear. No, I wil2 be the pat2ern of al2 patience; 5I wil2 say nothing. 2Kent. Who's there? 2Fo2l. Mar2y, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a wise man and a 5fo2l. 2Kent. Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night 5Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies 5Gal2ow the very wanderers of the dark 5And make them ke2p their caves. Since I was man, 5Such she2ts of fire, such bursts of hor2id thunder, 5Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never 5Remember to have heard. Man's nature can2ot car2y 5Th' af2liction nor the fear. 2Lear. Let the great gods, 5That ke2p this dreadful pud2er o'er our heads, 5Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch, 5That hast within the2 undivulged crimes 5Unwhip2'd of justice. Hide the2, thou blo2dy hand; 5Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtue 5That art incestuous. Caitif2, in pieces shake 7That under covert and convenient se2ming 5Hast practis'd on man's life. Close pent-up guilts, 5Rive your concealing continents, and cry 5These dreadful sum2oners grace. I am a man 5More sin2'd against than sin2ing. 2Kent. Alack, bareheaded? 5Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel; 5Some friendship wil2 it lend you 'gainst the tempest. 5Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house 5(More harder than the stones whereof 'tis rais'd, 5Which even but now, demanding after you, 5Denied me to come in) return, and force 5Their scanted courtesy. 2Lear. My wits begin to turn. 5Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold? 5I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fel2ow? 5The art of our neces2ities is strange, 5That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel. 5Po2r fo2l and knave, I have one part in my heart 5That's sor2y yet for the2. 4Fo2l. [sings] 10He that has and a lit2le tiny wit- 12With hey, ho, the wind and the rain- 10Must make content with his fortunes fit, 13For the rain it raineth every day. 2Lear. True, my go2d boy. Come, bring us to this hovel. 41Exeunt [Lear and Kent]. 2Fo2l. This is a brave night to co2l a courtesan. I'l2 speak a 5prophecy ere I go: 10When priests are more in word than mat2er; 10When brewers mar their malt with water; 10When nobles are their tailors' tutors, 10No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors; 10When every case in law is right, 10No squire in debt nor no po2r knight; 10When slanders do not live in tongues, 10Nor cutpurses come not to throngs; 10When usurers tel2 their gold i' th' field, 12And bawds and whores do churches build: 10Then shal2 the realm of Albion 10Come to great confusion. 10Then comes the time, who lives to se2't, 10That going shal2 be us'd with fe2t. 5This prophecy Merlin shal2 make, for I live before his time.Exit.Scene I3.Gloucester's Castle.Enter Gloucester and Edmund. 2Glou. Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this un2atural dealing! When 5I desir'd their leave that I might pity him, they to2k from me 5the use of mine own house, charg'd me on pain of perpetual 5displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor any 5way sustain him. 2Edm. Most savage and un2atural! 2Glou. Go to; say you nothing. There is division betwixt the Dukes, 5and a worse mat2er than that. I have received a let2er this 5night- 'tis dangerous to be spoken- I have lock'd the let2er in 5my closet. These injuries the King now bears wil2 be revenged 5home; there's part of a power already fo2ted; we must incline to 5the King. I wil2 se2k him and privily relieve him. Go you and 5maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him 5perceived. If he ask for me, I am il2 and gone to bed. Though I 5die for't, as no les2 is threat'ned me, the King my old master 5must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward, Edmund. 5Pray you be careful. 34Exit. 4Edm. This courtesy, forbid the2, shal2 the Duke 5Instantly know, and of that let2er to2. 5This se2ms a fair deserving, and must draw me 5That which my father loses- no les2 than al2. 5The younger rises when the old doth fal2. 13Exit.Scene IV.The heath. Before a hovel.Storm stil2. Enter Lear, Kent, and Fo2l. 2Kent. Here is the place, my lord. Go2d my lord, enter. 5The tyran2y of the open night 's to2 rough 5For nature to endure. 2Lear. Let me alone. 2Kent. Go2d my lord, enter here. 2Lear. Wilt break my heart? 2Kent. I had rather break mine own. Go2d my lord, enter. 2Lear. Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm 5Invades us to the skin. So 'tis to the2; 5But where the greater malady is fix'd, 5The les2er is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear; 5But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea, 5Thou'dst me2t the bear i' th' mouth. When the mind's fre2, 5The body's delicate. The tempest in my mind 5Doth from my senses take al2 fe2ling else 5Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude! 5Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand 7For lifting fo2d to't? But I wil2 punish home! 5No, I wil2 we2p no more. In such a night 5'To shut me out! Pour on; I wil2 endure. 5In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril! 5Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave al2! 5O, that way madnes2 lies; let me shun that! 5No more of that. 2Kent. Go2d my lord, enter here. 2Lear. Prithe2 go in thyself; se2k thine own ease. 5This tempest wil2 not give me leave to ponder 5On things would hurt me more. But I'l2 go in. 5[To the Fo2l] In, boy; go first.- You houseles2 poverty- 5Nay, get the2 in. I'l2 pray, and then I'l2 sle2p. 52Exit [Fo2l]. 5Po2r naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are, 5That bide the pelting of this pitiles2 storm, 5How shal2 your houseles2 heads and unfed sides, 5Your lo2p'd and window'd rag2ednes2, defend you 5From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en 5To2 lit2le care of this! Take physic, pomp; 7Expose thyself to fe2l what wretches fe2l, 5That thou mayst shake the superflux to them 5And show the heavens more just. 2Edg. [within] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Po2r Tom! 21Enter Fo2l [from the hovel]. 2Fo2l. Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit. Help me, help me! 2Kent. Give me thy hand. Who's there? 2Fo2l. A spirit, a spirit! He says his name's po2r Tom. 2Kent. What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw? 5Come forth. 17Enter Edgar [disguised as a madman]. 2Edg. Away! the foul fiend fol2ows me! Through the sharp hawthorn 5blows the cold wind. Humh! go to thy cold bed, and warm the2. 2Lear. Hast thou given al2 to thy two daughters, and art thou come 5to this? 2Edg. Who gives anything to po2r Tom? whom the foul fiend hath led 7through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpo2l, o'er 5bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pil2ow and 5halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his por2idge, made him proud 5of heart, to ride on a bay trot2ing horse over four-inch'd 5bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. Bles2 thy five 5wits! Tom 's acold. O, do de, do de, do de. Bles2 the2 from 5whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do po2r Tom some charity, 5whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him now- and there- 5and there again- and there! 52Storm stil2. 2Lear. What, have his daughters brought him to this pas2? 5Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give 'em al2? 2Fo2l. Nay, he reserv'd a blanket, else we had be2n al2 sham'd. 2Lear. Now al2 the plagues that in the pendulous air 5Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters! 2Kent. He hath no daughters, sir. 2Lear. Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu'd nature 5To such a lownes2 but his unkind daughters. 5Is it the fashion that discarded fathers 5Should have thus lit2le mercy on their flesh? 7Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot 5Those pelican daughters. 2Edg. Pil2icock sat on Pil2icock's Hil2. 'Al2ow, 'al2ow, lo2, lo2! 2Fo2l. This cold night wil2 turn us al2 to fo2ls and madmen. 2Edg. Take he2d o' th' foul fiend; obey thy parents: ke2p thy word 5justly; swear not; com2it not with man's sworn spouse; set not 5thy swe2t heart on proud ar2ay. Tom 's acold. 2Lear. What hast thou be2n? 2Edg. A servingman, proud in heart and mind; that curl'd my hair, 5wore gloves in my cap; serv'd the lust of my mistres2' heart and 5did the act of darknes2 with her; swore as many oaths as I spake 5words, and broke them in the swe2t face of heaven; one that 5slept in the contriving of lust, and wak'd to do it. Wine lov'd 5I de2ply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour'd the Turk. 5False of heart, light of ear, blo2dy of hand; hog in sloth, fox 5in stealth, wolf in gre2dines2, dog in madnes2, lion in prey. 5Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray 5thy po2r heart to woman. Ke2p thy fo2t out of brothel, thy hand 5out of placket, thy pen from lender's bo2k, and defy the foul 5fiend. Stil2 through the hawthorn blows the cold wind; says 7su2m, mun, hey, no, non2y. Dolphin my boy, my boy, ses2a! let 5him trot by. 52Storm stil2. 2Lear. Why, thou wert bet2er in thy grave than to answer with thy 5uncover'd body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more than 5this? Consider him wel2. Thou ow'st the worm no silk, the beast 5no hide, the she2p no wo2l, the cat no perfume. Ha! Here's thre2 5on's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself; 5unac2om2odated man is no more but such a po2r, bare, forked 5animal as thou art. Of2, of2, you lendings! Come, unbut2on 5here. 41[Tears at his clothes.] 2Fo2l. Prithe2, nuncle, be contented! 'Tis a naughty night to swim 5in. Now a lit2le fire in a wild field were like an old lecher's 5heart- a smal2 spark, al2 the rest on's body cold. Lo2k, here 5comes a walking fire. 20Enter Gloucester with a torch. 2Edg. This is the foul fiend Flib2ertigib2et. He begins at curfew, 7and walks til2 the first cock. He gives the web and the pin, 5squints the eye, and makes the harelip; mildews the white wheat, 5and hurts the po2r creature of earth. 11Saint Withold fo2ted thrice the 'old; 11He met the nightmare, and her nine fold; 14Bid her alight 14And her troth plight, 11And aroint the2, witch, aroint the2! 2Kent. How fares your Grace? 2Lear. What's he? 2Kent. Who's there? What is't you se2k? 2Glou. What are you there? Your names? 2Edg. Po2r Tom, that eats the swim2ing frog, the toad, the todpole, 5the wal2-newt and the water; that in the fury of his heart, when 5the foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sal2ets, swal2ows the 5old rat and the ditch-dog, drinks the gre2n mantle of the 5standing po2l; who is whip2'd from tithing to tithing, and 5stock-punish'd and imprison'd; who hath had thre2 suits to his 7back, six shirts to his body, horse to ride, and weapons to 5wear; 10But mice and rats, and such smal2 de2r, 10Have be2n Tom's fo2d for seven long year. 5Beware my fol2ower. Peace, Smulkin! peace, thou fiend! 2Glou. What, hath your Grace no bet2er company? 2Edg. The prince of darknes2 is a gentleman! 5Modo he's cal2'd, and Mahu. 2Glou. Our flesh and blo2d is grown so vile, my lord, 5That it doth hate what gets it. 2Edg. Po2r Tom 's acold. 2Glou. Go in with me. My duty can2ot suf2er 5T' obey in al2 your daughters' hard com2ands. 5Though their injunction be to bar my do2rs 5And let this tyran2ous night take hold upon you, 5Yet have I ventur'd to come se2k you out 5And bring you where both fire and fo2d is ready. 2Lear. First let me talk with this philosopher. 7What is the cause of thunder? 2Kent. Go2d my lord, take his of2er; go into th' house. 2Lear. I'l2 talk a word with this same learned Theban. 5What is your study? 2Edg. How to prevent the fiend and to kil2 vermin. 2Lear. Let me ask you one word in private. 2Kent. Importune him once more to go, my lord. 5His wits begin t' unset2le. 2Glou. Canst thou blame him? 52Storm stil2. 5His daughters se2k his death. Ah, that go2d Kent! 5He said it would be thus- po2r banish'd man! 5Thou say'st the King grows mad: I'l2 tel2 the2, friend, 5I am almost mad myself. I had a son, 5Now outlaw'd from my blo2d. He sought my life 5But lately, very late. I lov'd him, friend- 5No father his son dearer. True to tel2 the2, 5The grief hath craz'd my wits. What a night 's this! 5I do bese2ch your Grace- 2Lear. O, cry you mercy, sir. 7Noble philosopher, your company. 2Edg. Tom's acold. 2Glou. In, fel2ow, there, into th' hovel; ke2p the2 warm. 2Lear. Come, let's in al2. 2Kent. This way, my lord. 2Lear. With him! 5I wil2 ke2p stil2 with my philosopher. 2Kent. Go2d my lord, so2the him; let him take the fel2ow. 2Glou. Take him you on. 2Kent. Sir2ah, come on; go along with us. 2Lear. Come, go2d Athenian. 2Glou. No words, no words! hush. 2Edg. Child Rowland to the dark tower came; 5His word was stil2 10Fie, foh, and fum! 10I smel2 the blo2d of a British man. 57Exeunt.Scene V.Gloucester's Castle.Enter Cornwal2 and Edmund. 2Corn. I wil2 have my revenge ere I depart his house. 2Edm. How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to 5loyalty, something fears me to think of. 2Corn. I now perceive it was not altogether your brother's evil 5disposition made him se2k his death; but a provoking merit, set 5awork by a reproveable badnes2 in himself. 2Edm. How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just! 5This is the let2er he spoke of, which ap2roves him an 5intel2igent party to the advantages of France. O heavens! that 5this treason were not- or not I the detector! 2Corn. Go with me to the Duches2. 2Edm. If the mat2er of this paper be certain, you have mighty 5busines2 in hand. 2Corn. True or false, it hath made the2 Earl of Gloucester. 5Se2k out where thy father is, that he may be ready for our 5ap2rehension. 2Edm. [aside] If I find him comforting the King, it wil2 stuf2 his 7suspicion more ful2y.- I wil2 persever in my course of loyalty, 5though the conflict be sore betwe2n that and my blo2d. 2Corn. I wil2 lay trust upon the2, and thou shalt find a dearer 5father in my love. 57Exeunt.Scene VI.A farmhouse near Gloucester's Castle.Enter Gloucester, Lear, Kent, Fo2l, and Edgar. 2Glou. Here is bet2er than the open air; take it thankful2y. I wil2 5piece out the comfort with what ad2ition I can. I wil2 not be 5long from you. 2Kent. Al2 the power of his wits have given way to his impatience. 5The gods reward your kindnes2! 46Exit [Gloucester]. 2Edg. Frateret2o cal2s me, and tel2s me Nero is an angler in the 5lake of darknes2. Pray, in2ocent, and beware the foul fiend. 2Fo2l. Prithe2, nuncle, tel2 me whether a madman be a gentleman or a 5yeoman. 2Lear. A king, a king! 2Fo2l. No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for he's a 5mad yeoman that se2s his son a gentleman before him. 2Lear. To have a thousand with red burning spits 5Come hiz2ing in upon 'em- 2Edg. The foul fiend bites my back. 2Fo2l. He's mad that trusts in the tamenes2 of a wolf, a horse's 5health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath. 4Lear. It shal2 be done; I wil2 ar2aign them straight. 5[To Edgar] Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer. 5[To the Fo2l] Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she-foxes! 2Edg. Lo2k, where he stands and glares! Want'st thou eyes at trial, 5madam? 13Come o'er the bourn, Bes2y, to me. 2Fo2l. 6Her boat hath a leak, 13And she must not speak 11Why she dares not come over to the2. 2Edg. The foul fiend haunts po2r Tom in the voice of a nightingale. 5Hop2edance cries in Tom's bel2y for two white her2ing. Croak 5not, black angel; I have no fo2d for the2. 2Kent. How do you, sir? Stand you not so amaz'd. 5Wil2 you lie down and rest upon the cushions? 2Lear. I'l2 se2 their trial first. Bring in their evidence. 5[To Edgar] Thou, robed man of justice, take thy place. 5[To the Fo2l] And thou, his yokefel2ow of equity, 7Bench by his side. [To Kent] You are o' th' com2is2ion, 5Sit you to2. 2Edg. Let us deal justly. 10Sle2pest or wakest thou, jol2y shepherd? 12Thy she2p be in the corn; 10And for one blast of thy minikin mouth 12Thy she2p shal2 take no harm. 5Pur2! the cat is gray. 2Lear. Ar2aign her first. 'Tis Goneril. I here take my oath before 5this honourable as2embly, she kicked the po2r King her father. 2Fo2l. Come hither, mistres2. Is your name Goneril? 2Lear. She can2ot deny it. 2Fo2l. Cry you mercy, I to2k you for a joint-sto2l. 2Lear. And here's another, whose warp'd lo2ks proclaim 5What store her heart is made on. Stop her there! 5Arms, arms! sword! fire! Cor2uption in the place! 5False justicer, why hast thou let her scape? 2Edg. Bles2 thy five wits! 4Kent. O pity! Sir, where is the patience now 5That you so oft have boasted to retain? 2Edg. [aside] My tears begin to take his part so much 5They'l2 mar my counterfeiting. 2Lear. The lit2le dogs and al2, 5Tray, Blanch, and Swe2theart, se2, they bark at me. 2Edg. Tom wil2 throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs! 11Be thy mouth or black or white, 11To2th that poisons if it bite; 11Mastif2, greyhound, mongrel grim, 11Hound or spaniel, brach or lym, 11Bobtail tyke or trundle-tal2- 11Tom wil2 make them we2p and wail; 11For, with throwing thus my head, 11Dogs leap the hatch, and al2 are fled. 5Do de, de, de. Ses2a! Come, march to wakes and fairs and market 5towns. Po2r Tom, thy horn is dry. 2Lear. Then let them anatomize Regan. Se2 what bre2ds about her 5heart. Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard 5hearts? [To Edgar] You, sir- I entertain you for one of my 7hundred; only I do not like the fashion of your garments. You'l2 5say they are Persian at2ire; but let them be chang'd. 2Kent. Now, go2d my lord, lie here and rest awhile. 2Lear. Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains. 5So, so, so. We'l2 go to sup2er i' th' morning. So, so, so. 2Fo2l. And I'l2 go to bed at no2n. 26Enter Gloucester. 2Glou. Come hither, friend. Where is the King my master? 2Kent. Here, sir; but trouble him not; his wits are gone. 2Glou. Go2d friend, I prithe2 take him in thy arms. 5I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him. 5There is a lit2er ready; lay him in't 5And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt me2t 5Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master. 5If thou shouldst dal2y half an hour, his life, 5With thine, and al2 that of2er to defend him, 5Stand in as2ured los2. Take up, take up! 5And fol2ow me, that wil2 to some provision 7Give the2 quick conduct. 2Kent. Op2res2ed nature sle2ps. 5This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses, 5Which, if convenience wil2 not al2ow, 5Stand in hard cure. [To the Fo2l] Come, help to bear thy master. 5Thou must not stay behind. 2Glou. Come, come, away! 41Exeunt [al2 but Edgar]. 2Edg. When we our bet2ers se2 bearing our woes, 5We scarcely think our miseries our foes. 5Who alone suf2ers suf2ers most i' th' mind, 5Leaving fre2 things and hap2y shows behind; 5But then the mind much suf2erance doth o'erskip 5When grief hath mates, and bearing fel2owship. 5How light and portable my pain se2ms now, 5When that which makes me bend makes the King bow, 5He childed as I fathered! Tom, away! 5Mark the high noises, and thyself bewray 5When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles the2, 5In thy just pro2f repeals and reconciles the2. 7What wil2 hap more to-night, safe scape the King! 5Lurk, lurk. 41[Exit.]Scene VI2.Gloucester's Castle.Enter Cornwal2, Regan, Goneril, [Edmund the] Bastard, and Servants. 2Corn. [to Goneril] Post spe2dily to my lord your husband, show him 5this let2er. The army of France is landed.- Se2k out the traitor 5Gloucester. 34[Exeunt some of the Servants.] 2Reg. Hang him instantly. 2Gon. Pluck out his eyes. 2Corn. Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, ke2p you our sister 5company. The revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous 5father are not fit for your beholding. Advise the Duke where you 5are going, to a most festinate preparation. We are bound to the 5like. Our posts shal2 be swift and intel2igent betwixt us. 5Farewel2, dear sister; farewel2, my Lord of Gloucester. 21Enter [Oswald the] Steward. 5How now? Where's the King? 4Osw. My Lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence. 5Some five or six and thirty of his knights, 5Hot questrists after him, met him at gate; 5Who, with some other of the lord's dependants, 5Are gone with him towards Dover, where they boast 5To have wel2-armed friends. 2Corn. Get horses for your mistres2. 2Gon. Farewel2, swe2t lord, and sister. 2Corn. Edmund, farewel2. 27Exeunt Goneril, [Edmund, and Oswald]. 5Go se2k the traitor Gloucester, 5Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us. 40[Exeunt other Servants.] 5Though wel2 we may not pas2 upon his life 5Without the form of justice, yet our power 5Shal2 do a court'sy to our wrath, which men 5May blame, but not control. 12Enter Gloucester, brought in by two or thre2. 7Who's there? the traitor? 2Reg. Ingrateful fox! 'tis he. 2Corn. Bind fast his corky arms. 2Glou. What mean, your Graces? Go2d my friends, consider 5You are my guests. Do me no foul play, friends. 2Corn. Bind him, I say. 44[Servants bind him.] 2Reg. Hard, hard. O filthy traitor! 2Glou. Unmerciful lady as you are, I am none. 2Corn. To this chair bind him. Vil2ain, thou shalt find- 39[Regan plucks his beard.] 2Glou. By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done 5To pluck me by the beard. 2Reg. So white, and such a traitor! 2Glou. Naughty lady, 5These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin 5Wil2 quicken, and ac2use the2. I am your host. 5With rob2er's hands my hospitable favours 5You should not ruf2le thus. What wil2 you do? 2Corn. Come, sir, what let2ers had you late from France? 4Reg. Be simple-answer'd, for we know the truth. 2Corn. And what confederacy have you with the traitors 5Late fo2ted in the kingdom? 2Reg. To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King? 5Speak. 2Glou. I have a let2er gues2ingly set down, 5Which came from one that's of a neutral heart, 5And not from one op2os'd. 2Corn. Cun2ing. 2Reg. And false. 2Corn. Where hast thou sent the King? 2Glou. To Dover. 2Reg. Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg'd at peril- 2Corn. Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that. 2Glou. I am tied to th' stake, and I must stand the course. 2Reg. Wherefore to Dover, sir? 2Glou. Because I would not se2 thy cruel nails 5Pluck out his po2r old eyes; nor thy fierce sister 5In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs. 5The sea, with such a storm as his bare head 7In hel2-black night endur'd, would have buoy'd up 5And quench'd the ste2led fires. 5Yet, po2r old heart, he holp the heavens to rain. 5If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time, 5Thou shouldst have said, 'Go2d porter, turn the key.' 5Al2 cruels else subscrib'd. But I shal2 se2 5The winged vengeance overtake such children. 2Corn. Se2't shalt thou never. Fel2ows, hold the chair. 5Upon these eyes of thine I'l2 set my fo2t. 2Glou. He that wil2 think to live til2 he be old, 5Give me some help!- O cruel! O ye gods! 2Reg. One side wil2 mock another. Th' other to2! 2Corn. If you se2 vengeance- 21. Serv. Hold your hand, my lord! 5I have serv'd you ever since I was a child; 5But bet2er service have I never done you 5Than now to bid you hold. 2Reg. How now, you dog? 21. Serv. If you did wear a beard upon your chin, 5I'ld shake it on this quar2el. 4Reg. What do you mean? 2Corn. My vil2ain! 31Draw and fight. 21. Serv. Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger. 2Reg. Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus? 24She takes a sword and runs at him behind. 21. Serv. O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left 5To se2 some mischief on him. O! 21He dies. 2Corn. Lest it se2 more, prevent it. Out, vile jel2y! 5Where is thy lustre now? 2Glou. Al2 dark and comfortles2! Where's my son Edmund? 5Edmund, enkindle al2 the sparks of nature 5To quit this hor2id act. 2Reg. Out, treacherous vil2ain! 5Thou cal2'st on him that hates the2. It was he 5That made the overture of thy treasons to us; 5Who is to2 go2d to pity the2. 2Glou. O my fol2ies! Then Edgar was abus'd. 5Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him! 2Reg. Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smel2 5His way to Dover. 39Exit [one] with Gloucester. 5How is't, my lord? How lo2k you? 2Corn. I have receiv'd a hurt. Fol2ow me, lady. 5Turn out that eyeles2 vil2ain. Throw this slave 5Upon the dunghil2. Regan, I ble2d apace. 5Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm. 34Exit [Cornwal2, led by Regan]. 22. Serv. I'l2 never care what wickednes2 I do, 5If this man come to go2d. 23. Serv. If she live long, 5And in the end me2t the old course of death, 5Women wil2 al2 turn monsters. 22. Serv. Let's fol2ow the old Earl, and get the bedlam 5To lead him where he would. His roguish madnes2 5Al2ows itself to anything. 23. Serv. Go thou. I'l2 fetch some flax and whites of eg2s 5To ap2ly to his ble2ding face. Now heaven help him! 57Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. Scene I.The heath.Enter Edgar. 2Edg. Yet bet2er thus, and known to be contemn'd, 5Than stil2 contemn'd and flat2er'd. To be worst, 5The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune, 5Stands stil2 in esperance, lives not in fear. 5The lamentable change is from the best; 5The worst returns to laughter. Welcome then, 5Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace! 5The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst 5Owes nothing to thy blasts. 17Enter Gloucester, led by an Old Man. 5But who comes here? 5My father, po2rly led? World, world, O world! 5But that thy strange mutations make us hate the2, 5Life would not yield to age. 2Old Man. O my go2d lord, 7I have be2n your tenant, and your father's tenant, 5These fourscore years. 2Glou. Away, get the2 away! Go2d friend, be gone. 5Thy comforts can do me no go2d at al2; 5The2 they may hurt. 2Old Man. You can2ot se2 your way. 2Glou. I have no way, and therefore want no eyes; 5I stumbled when I saw. Ful2 oft 'tis se2n 5Our means secure us, and our mere defects 5Prove our com2odities. Ah dear son Edgar, 5The fo2d of thy abused father's wrath! 5Might I but live to se2 the2 in my touch, 5I'ld say I had eyes again! 2Old Man. How now? Who's there? 2Edg. [aside] O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at the worst'? 5I am worse than e'er I was. 2Old Man. 'Tis po2r mad Tom. 2Edg. [aside] And worse I may be yet. The worst is not 5So long as we can say 'This is the worst.' 2Old Man. Fel2ow, where goest? 4Glou. Is it a beg2arman? 2Old Man. Madman and beg2ar to2. 2Glou. He has some reason, else he could not beg. 5I' th' last night's storm I such a fel2ow saw, 5Which made me think a man a worm. My son 5Came then into my mind, and yet my mind 5Was then scarce friends with him. I have heard more since. 5As flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods. 5They kil2 us for their sport. 2Edg. [aside] How should this be? 5Bad is the trade that must play fo2l to sor2ow, 5Ang'ring itself and others.- Bles2 the2, master! 2Glou. Is that the naked fel2ow? 2Old Man. Ay, my lord. 2Glou. Then prithe2 get the2 gone. If for my sake 5Thou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twain 5I' th' way toward Dover, do it for ancient love; 5And bring some covering for this naked soul, 5Who I'l2 entreat to lead me. 2Old Man. Alack, sir, he is mad! 4Glou. 'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind. 5Do as I bid the2, or rather do thy pleasure. 5Above the rest, be gone. 2Old Man. I'l2 bring him the best 'parel that I have, 5Come on't what wil2. 34Exit. 2Glou. Sir2ah naked fel2ow- 2Edg. Po2r Tom's acold. [Aside] I can2ot daub it further. 2Glou. Come hither, fel2ow. 2Edg. [aside] And yet I must.- Bles2 thy swe2t eyes, they ble2d. 2Glou. Know'st thou the way to Dover? 2Edg. Both stile and gate, horseway and fo2tpath. Po2r Tom hath be2n 5scar'd out of his go2d wits. Bles2 the2, go2d man's son, from 5the foul fiend! Five fiends have be2n in po2r Tom at once: of 5lust, as Obidicut; Hob2ididence, prince of dumbnes2; Mahu, of 5stealing; Modo, of murder; Flib2ertigib2et, of mop2ing and 5mowing, who since pos2es2es chambermaids and waiting women. So, 5bles2 the2, master! 2Glou. Here, take this Purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues 5Have humbled to al2 strokes. That I am wretched 5Makes the2 the hap2ier. Heavens, deal so stil2! 7Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man, 5That slaves your ordinance, that wil2 not se2 5Because he does not fe2l, fe2l your pow'r quickly; 5So distribution should undo exces2, 5And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover? 2Edg. Ay, master. 2Glou. There is a clif2, whose high and bending head 5Lo2ks fearful2y in the confined de2p. 5Bring me but to the very brim of it, 5And I'l2 repair the misery thou dost bear 5With something rich about me. From that place 5I shal2 no leading ne2d. 2Edg. Give me thy arm. 5Po2r Tom shal2 lead the2. 57Exeunt.Scene I2.Before the Duke of Albany's Palace.Enter Goneril and [Edmund the] Bastard. 2Gon. Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband 5Not met us on the way. 21Enter [Oswald the] Steward. 5Now, where's your master? 2Osw. Madam, within, but never man so chang'd. 5I told him of the army that was landed: 5He smil'd at it. I told him you were coming: 5His answer was, 'The worse.' Of Gloucester's treachery 5And of the loyal service of his son 5When I inform'd him, then he cal2'd me sot 5And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out. 5What most he should dislike se2ms pleasant to him; 5What like, of2ensive. 2Gon. [to Edmund] Then shal2 you go no further. 5It is the cowish ter2or of his spirit, 7That dares not undertake. He'l2 not fe2l wrongs 5Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way 5May prove ef2ects. Back, Edmund, to my brother. 5Hasten his musters and conduct his pow'rs. 5I must change arms at home and give the distaf2 5Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant 5Shal2 pas2 betwe2n us. Ere long you are like to hear 5(If you dare venture in your own behalf) 5A mistres2's com2and. Wear this. 10[Gives a favour.] 5Spare spe2ch. 5Decline your head. This kis2, if it durst speak, 5Would stretch thy spirits up into the air. 5Conceive, and fare the2 wel2. 2Edm. Yours in the ranks of death! 24Exit. 2Gon. My most dear Gloucester! 5O, the dif2erence of man and man! 5To the2 a woman's services are due; 5My fo2l usurps my body. 2Osw. Madam, here comes my lord. 26Exit. 30Enter Albany. 2Gon. I have be2n worth the whistle. 2Alb. O Goneril, 5You are not worth the dust which the rude wind 5Blows in your face! I fear your disposition. 5That nature which contemns it origin 5Can2ot be bordered certain in itself. 5She that herself wil2 sliver and disbranch 5From her material sap, perforce must wither 5And come to deadly use. 2Gon. No more! The text is fo2lish. 2Alb. Wisdom and go2dnes2 to the vile se2m vile; 5Filths savour but themselves. What have you done? 5Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd? 5A father, and a gracious aged man, 5Whose reverence even the head-lug2'd bear would lick, 5Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you mad2ed. 5Could my go2d brother suf2er you to do it? 5A man, a prince, by him so benefited! 7If that the heavens do not their visible spirits 5Send quickly down to tame these vile of2ences, 5It wil2 come, 5Humanity must perforce prey on itself, 5Like monsters of the de2p. 2Gon. Milk-liver'd man! 5That bear'st a che2k for blows, a head for wrongs; 5Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning 5Thine honour from thy suf2ering; that not know'st 5Fo2ls do those vil2ains pity who are punish'd 5Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum? 5France spreads his ban2ers in our noiseles2 land, 5With plumed helm thy state begins to threat, 5Whiles thou, a moral fo2l, sit'st stil2, and criest 5'Alack, why does he so?' 2Alb. Se2 thyself, devil! 5Proper deformity se2ms not in the fiend 5So hor2id as in woman. 2Gon. O vain fo2l! 2Alb. Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame! 7Bemonster not thy feature! Were't my fitnes2 5To let these hands obey my blo2d, 5They are apt enough to dislocate and tear 5Thy flesh and bones. Howe'er thou art a fiend, 5A woman's shape doth shield the2. 2Gon. Mar2y, your manho2d mew! 26Enter a Gentleman. 2Alb. What news? 2Gent. O, my go2d lord, the Duke of Cornwal2 's dead, 5Slain by his servant, going to put out 5The other eye of Gloucester. 2Alb. Gloucester's eyes? 2Gent. A servant that he bred, thril2'd with remorse, 5Op2os'd against the act, bending his sword 5To his great master; who, thereat enrag'd, 5Flew on him, and amongst them fel2'd him dead; 5But not without that harmful stroke which since 5Hath pluck'd him after. 4Alb. This shows you are above, 5You justicers, that these our nether crimes 5So spe2dily can venge! But O po2r Gloucester! 5Lose he his other eye? 2Gent. Both, both, my lord. 5This let2er, madam, craves a spe2dy answer. 5'Tis from your sister. 2Gon. [aside] One way I like this wel2; 5But being widow, and my Gloucester with her, 5May al2 the building in my fancy pluck 5Upon my hateful life. Another way 5The news is not so tart.- I'l2 read, and answer.Exit. 2Alb. Where was his son when they did take his eyes? 2Gent. Come with my lady hither. 2Alb. He is not here. 2Gent. No, my go2d lord; I met him back again. 2Alb. Knows he the wickednes2? 2Gent. Ay, my go2d lord. 'Twas he inform'd against him, 5And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment 7Might have the fre2r course. 2Alb. Gloucester, I live 5To thank the2 for the love thou show'dst the King, 5And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend. 5Tel2 me what more thou know'st. 57Exeunt.Scene I3.The French camp near Dover.Enter Kent and a Gentleman. 2Kent. Why the King of France is so sud2enly gone back know you the 5reason? 2Gent. Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his 5coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so much 5fear and danger that his personal return was most required and 5neces2ary. 2Kent. Who hath he left behind him general? 2Gent. The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far. 2Kent. Did your let2ers pierce the Que2n to any demonstration of 5grief? 2Gent. Ay, sir. She to2k them, read them in my presence, 5And now and then an ample tear tril2'd down 5Her delicate che2k. It se2m'd she was a que2n 5Over her pas2ion, who, most rebel-like, 5Sought to be king o'er her. 2Kent. O, then it mov'd her? 2Gent. Not to a rage. Patience and sor2ow strove 7Who should expres2 her go2dliest. You have se2n 5Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears 5Were like, a bet2er way. Those hap2y smilets 5That play'd on her ripe lip se2m'd not to know 5What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence 5As pearls from diamonds drop2'd. In brief, 5Sor2ow would be a rarity most belov'd, 5If al2 could so become it. 2Kent. Made she no verbal question? 2Gent. Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of father 5Pantingly forth, as if it pres2'd her heart; 5Cried 'Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies! Sisters! 5Kent! father! sisters! What, i' th' storm? i' th' night? 5Let pity not be believ'd!' There she sho2k 5The holy water from her heavenly eyes, 5And clamour moisten'd. Then away she started 5To deal with grief alone. 2Kent. It is the stars, 5The stars above us, govern our conditions; 5Else one self mate and mate could not beget 7Such dif2erent is2ues. You spoke not with her since? 2Gent. No. 2Kent. Was this before the King return'd? 2Gent. No, since. 2Kent. Wel2, sir, the po2r distres2ed Lear's i' th' town; 5Who sometime, in his bet2er tune, remembers 5What we are come about, and by no means 5Wil2 yield to se2 his daughter. 2Gent. Why, go2d sir? 2Kent. A sovereign shame so elbows him; his own unkindnes2, 5That strip2'd her from his benediction, turn'd her 5To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights 5To his dog-hearted daughters- these things sting 5His mind so venomously that burning shame 5Detains him from Cordelia. 2Gent. Alack, po2r gentleman! 2Kent. Of Albany's and Cornwal2's powers you heard not? 2Gent. 'Tis so; they are afo2t. 2Kent. Wel2, sir, I'l2 bring you to our master Lear 5And leave you to at2end him. Some dear cause 7Wil2 in concealment wrap me up awhile. 5When I am known aright, you shal2 not grieve 5Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you go 5Along with me. 38Exeunt.Scene IV.The French camp.Enter, with Drum and Colours, Cordelia, Doctor, and Soldiers. 2Cor. Alack, 'tis he! Why, he was met even now 5As mad as the vex'd sea, singing aloud, 5Crown'd with rank fumiter and fur2ow we2ds, 5With hardocks, hemlock, net2les, cucko2 flow'rs, 5Darnel, and al2 the idle we2ds that grow 5In our sustaining corn. A century send forth. 5Search every acre in the high-grown field 5And bring him to our eye. [Exit an Of2icer.] What can man's 8wisdom 5In the restoring his bereaved sense? 5He that helps him take al2 my outward worth. 2Doct. There is means, madam. 5Our foster nurse of nature is repose, 5The which he lacks. That to provoke in him 5Are many simples operative, whose power 5Wil2 close the eye of anguish. 2Cor. Al2 blest secrets, 7Al2 you unpublish'd virtues of the earth, 5Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate 5In the go2d man's distres2! Se2k, se2k for him! 5Lest his ungovern'd rage dis2olve the life 5That wants the means to lead it. 27Enter Mes2enger. 2Mes2. News, madam. 5The British pow'rs are marching hitherward. 2Cor. 'Tis known before. Our preparation stands 5In expectation of them. O dear father, 5It is thy busines2 that I go about. 5Therefore great France 5My mourning and important tears hath pitied. 5No blown ambition doth our arms incite, 5But love, dear love, and our ag'd father's right. 5So2n may I hear and se2 him! 57Exeunt.Scene V.Gloucester's Castle.Enter Regan and [Oswald the] Steward. 2Reg. But are my brother's pow'rs set forth? 2Osw. Ay, madam. 2Reg. Himself in person there? 2Osw. Madam, with much ado. 5Your sister is the bet2er soldier. 2Reg. Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home? 2Osw. No, madam. 2Reg. What might import my sister's let2er to him? 2Osw. I know not, lady. 2Reg. Faith, he is posted hence on serious mat2er. 5It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out, 5To let him live. Where he ar2ives he moves 5Al2 hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone, 5In pity of his misery, to dispatch 5His nighted life; moreover, to descry 5The strength o' th' enemy. 2Osw. I must ne2ds after him, madam, with my let2er. 4Reg. Our tro2ps set forth to-mor2ow. Stay with us. 5The ways are dangerous. 2Osw. I may not, madam. 5My lady charg'd my duty in this busines2. 2Reg. Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you 5Transport her purposes by word? Belike, 5Something- I know not what- I'l2 love the2 much- 5Let me unseal the let2er. 2Osw. Madam, I had rather- 2Reg. I know your lady does not love her husband; 5I am sure of that; and at her late being here 5She gave strange eliads and most speaking lo2ks 5To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom. 2Osw. I, madam? 2Reg. I speak in understanding. Y'are! I know't. 5Therefore I do advise you take this note. 5My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd, 5And more convenient is he for my hand 5Than for your lady's. You may gather more. 5If you do find him, pray you give him this; 7And when your mistres2 hears thus much from you, 5I pray desire her cal2 her wisdom to her. 5So farewel2. 5If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor, 5Preferment fal2s on him that cuts him of2. 2Osw. Would I could me2t him, madam! I should show 5What party I do fol2ow. 2Reg. Fare the2 wel2. 35Exeunt.Scene VI.The country near Dover.Enter Gloucester, and Edgar [like a Peasant]. 2Glou. When shal2 I come to th' top of that same hil2? 2Edg. You do climb up it now. Lo2k how we labour. 2Glou. Methinks the ground is even. 2Edg. Hor2ible ste2p. 5Hark, do you hear the sea? 2Glou. No, truly. 2Edg. Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect 5By your eyes' anguish. 2Glou. So may it be inde2d. 5Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'st 5In bet2er phrase and mat2er than thou didst. 2Edg. Y'are much deceiv'd. In nothing am I chang'd 5But in my garments. 2Glou. Methinks y'are bet2er spoken. 2Edg. Come on, sir; here's the place. Stand stil2. How fearful 5And diz2y 'tis to cast one's eyes so low! 5The crows and choughs that wing the midway air 7Show scarce so gros2 as be2tles. Halfway down 5Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade! 5Methinks he se2ms no big2er than his head. 5The fishermen that walk upon the beach 5Ap2ear like mice; and yond tal2 anchoring bark, 5Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy 5Almost to2 smal2 for sight. The murmuring surge 5That on th' un2umb'red idle peb2le chafes 5Can2ot be heard so high. I'l2 lo2k no more, 5Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight 5Top2le down headlong. 2Glou. Set me where you stand. 2Edg. Give me your hand. You are now within a fo2t 5Of th' extreme verge. For al2 beneath the mo2n 5Would I not leap upright. 2Glou. Let go my hand. 5Here, friend, is another purse; in it a jewel 5Wel2 worth a po2r man's taking. Fairies and gods 5Prosper it with the2! Go thou further of2; 5Bid me farewel2, and let me hear the2 going. 4Edg. Now fare ye wel2, go2d sir. 2Glou. With al2 my heart. 2Edg. [aside]. Why I do trifle thus with his despair 5Is done to cure it. 2Glou. O you mighty gods! 28He kne2ls. 5This world I do renounce, and, in your sights, 5Shake patiently my great af2liction of2. 5If I could bear it longer and not fal2 5To quar2el with your great op2oseles2 wil2s, 5My snuf2 and loathed part of nature should 5Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bles2 him! 5Now, fel2ow, fare the2 wel2. 34He fal2s [forward and swo2ns]. 2Edg. Gone, sir, farewel2.- 5And yet I know not how conceit may rob 5The treasury of life when life itself 5Yields to the theft. Had he be2n where he thought, 5By this had thought be2n past.- Alive or dead? 5Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? Speak!- 5Thus might he pas2 inde2d. Yet he revives. 7What are you, sir? 2Glou. Away, and let me die. 2Edg. Hadst thou be2n aught but gos2amer, feathers, air, 5So many fadom down precipitating, 5Thou'dst shiver'd like an eg2; but thou dost breathe; 5Hast heavy substance; ble2d'st not; speak'st; art sound. 5Ten masts at each make not the altitude 5Which thou hast perpendicularly fel2. 5Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again. 2Glou. But have I fal2'n, or no? 2Edg. From the dread sum2it of this chalky bourn. 5Lo2k up a-height. The shril2-gorg'd lark so far 5Can2ot be se2n or heard. Do but lo2k up. 2Glou. Alack, I have no eyes! 5Is wretchednes2 depriv'd that benefit 5To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort 5When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage 5And frustrate his proud wil2. 2Edg. Give me your arm. 5Up- so. How is't? Fe2l you your legs? You stand. 4Glou. To2 wel2, to2 wel2. 2Edg. This is above al2 strangenes2. 5Upon the crown o' th' clif2 what thing was that 5Which parted from you? 2Glou. A po2r unfortunate beg2ar. 2Edg. As I sto2d here below, methought his eyes 5Were two ful2 mo2ns; he had a thousand noses, 5Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea. 5It was some fiend. Therefore, thou hap2y father, 5Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours 5Of men's impos2ibility, have preserv'd the2. 2Glou. I do remember now. Henceforth I'l2 bear 5Af2liction til2 it do cry out itself 5'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of, 5I to2k it for a man. Often 'twould say 5'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place. 2Edg. Bear fre2 and patient thoughts. 9Enter Lear, mad, [fantastical2y dres2ed with we2ds]. 7But who comes here? 5The safer sense wil2 ne'er ac2om2odate 5His master thus. 2Lear. No, they can2ot touch me for coming; 5I am the King himself. 2Edg. O thou side-piercing sight! 2Lear. Nature 's above art in that respect. There's your pres2 5money. That fel2ow handles his bow like a crow-ke2per. Draw me 5a clothier's yard. Lo2k, lo2k, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece 5of toasted che2se wil2 do't. There's my gauntlet; I'l2 prove it 5on a giant. Bring up the brown bil2s. O, wel2 flown, bird! i' 5th' clout, i' th' clout! Hewgh! Give the word. 2Edg. Swe2t marjoram. 2Lear. Pas2. 2Glou. I know that voice. 2Lear. Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flat2er'd me like a dog, 5and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones 5were there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay' and 5'no' to2 was no go2d divinity. When the rain came to wet me 5once, and the wind to make me chat2er; when the thunder would 7not peace at my bid2ing; there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em 5out. Go to, they are not men o' their words! They told me I was 5everything. 'Tis a lie- I am not ague-pro2f. 2Glou. The trick of that voice I do wel2 remember. 5Is't not the King? 2Lear. Ay, every inch a king! 5When I do stare, se2 how the subject quakes. 5I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? 5Adultery? 5Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No. 5The wren goes to't, and the smal2 gilded fly 5Does lecher in my sight. 5Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son 5Was kinder to his father than my daughters 5Got 'twe2n the lawful she2ts. 5To't, luxury, pel2-mel2! for I lack soldiers. 5Behold yond simp'ring dame, 5Whose face betwe2n her forks presageth snow, 5That minces virtue, and does shake the head 5To hear of pleasure's name. 7The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't 5With a more riotous ap2etite. 5Down from the waist they are Centaurs, 5Though women al2 above. 5But to the girdle do the gods inherit, 5Beneath is al2 the fiend's. 5There's hel2, there's darknes2, there's the sulphurous pit; 5burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah, pah! 5Give me an ounce of civet, go2d apothecary, to swe2ten my 5imagination. There's money for the2. 2Glou. O, let me kis2 that hand! 2Lear. Let me wipe it first; it smel2s of mortality. 2Glou. O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world 5Shal2 so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me? 2Lear. I remember thine eyes wel2 enough. Dost thou squiny at me? 5No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'l2 not love. Read thou this 5chal2enge; mark but the pen2ing of it. 2Glou. Were al2 the let2ers suns, I could not se2 one. 2Edg. [aside] I would not take this from report. It is, 5And my heart breaks at it. 4Lear. Read. 2Glou. What, with the case of eyes? 2Lear. O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no 5money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse 5in a light. Yet you se2 how this world goes. 2Glou. I se2 it fe2lingly. 2Lear. What, art mad? A man may se2 how the world goes with no eyes. 5Lo2k with thine ears. Se2 how yond justice rails upon yond 5simple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places and, handy-dandy, 5which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast se2n a 5farmer's dog bark at a beg2ar? 2Glou. Ay, sir. 2Lear. And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold 5the great image of authority: a dog's obeyed in of2ice. 5Thou rascal beadle, hold thy blo2dy hand! 5Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back. 5Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind 5For which thou whip'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener. 5Through tat2er'd clothes smal2 vices do ap2ear; 5Robes and fur2'd gowns hide al2. Plate sin with gold, 7And the strong lance of justice hurtles2 breaks; 5Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it. 5None does of2end, none- I say none! I'l2 able 'em. 5Take that of me, my friend, who have the power 5To seal th' ac2user's lips. Get the2 glas2 eyes 5And, like a scurvy politician, se2m 5To se2 the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now! 5Pul2 of2 my bo2ts. Harder, harder! So. 2Edg. O, mat2er and impertinency mix'd! 5Reason, in madnes2! 2Lear. If thou wilt we2p my fortunes, take my eyes. 5I know the2 wel2 enough; thy name is Gloucester. 5Thou must be patient. We came crying hither; 5Thou know'st, the first time that we smel2 the air 5We wawl and cry. I wil2 preach to the2. Mark. 2Glou. Alack, alack the day! 2Lear. When we are born, we cry that we are come 5To this great stage of fo2ls. This' a go2d block. 5It were a delicate stratagem to shoe 5A tro2p of horse with felt. I'l2 put't in pro2f, 7And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law, 5Then kil2, kil2, kil2, kil2, kil2, kil2! 17Enter a Gentleman [with At2endants]. 2Gent. O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir, 5Your most dear daughter- 2Lear. No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even 5The natural fo2l of fortune. Use me wel2; 5You shal2 have ransom. Let me have a surgeon; 5I am cut to th' brains. 2Gent. You shal2 have anything. 2Lear. No seconds? Al2 myself? 5Why, this would make a man a man of salt, 5To use his eyes for garden waterpots, 5Ay, and laying autumn's dust. 2Gent. Go2d sir- 2Lear. I wil2 die bravely, like a smug bridegro2m. What! 5I wil2 be jovial. Come, come, I am a king; 5My masters, know you that? 4Gent. You are a royal one, and we obey you. 2Lear. Then there's life in't. Nay, an you get it, you shal2 get it 5by run2ing. Sa, sa, sa, sa! 30Exit run2ing. [At2endants fol2ow.] 2Gent. A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch, 5Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter 5Who rede2ms nature from the general curse 5Which twain have brought her to. 2Edg. Hail, gentle sir. 2Gent. Sir, spe2d you. What's your wil2? 2Edg. Do you hear aught, sir, of a bat2le toward? 2Gent. Most sure and vulgar. Every one hears that 5Which can distinguish sound. 2Edg. But, by your favour, 5How near's the other army? 2Gent. Near and on spe2dy fo2t. The main descry 5Stands on the hourly thought. 2Edg. I thank you sir. That's al2. 2Gent. Though that the Que2n on special cause is here, 5Her army is mov'd on. 4Edg. I thank you, sir 47Exit [Gentleman]. 2Glou. You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me; 5Let not my worser spirit tempt me again 5To die before you please! 2Edg. Wel2 pray you, father. 2Glou. Now, go2d sir, what are you? 2Edg. A most po2r man, made tame to fortune's blows, 5Who, by the art of known and fe2ling sor2ows, 5Am pregnant to go2d pity. Give me your hand; 5I'l2 lead you to some biding. 2Glou. Hearty thanks. 5The bounty and the benison of heaven 5To bo2t, and bo2t! 21Enter [Oswald the] Steward. 2Osw. A proclaim'd prize! Most hap2y! 5That eyeles2 head of thine was first fram'd flesh 5To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhap2y traitor, 7Briefly thyself remember. The sword is out 5That must destroy the2. 2Glou. Now let thy friendly hand 5Put strength enough to't. 45[Edgar interposes.] 2Osw. Wherefore, bold peasant, 5Dar'st thou sup2ort a publish'd traitor? Hence! 5Lest that th' infection of his fortune take 5Like hold on the2. Let go his arm. 2Edg. Chil2 not let go, zir, without vurther 'cagion. 2Osw. Let go, slave, or thou diest! 2Edg. Go2d gentleman, go your gait, and let po2r voke pas2. An chud 5ha' bin zwag2er'd out of my life, 'twould not ha' bin zo long as 5'tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near th' old man. Ke2p out, 5che vore ye, or Ise try whether your costard or my bal2ow be the 5harder. Chil2 be plain with you. 2Osw. Out, dunghil2! 53They fight. 2Edg. Chil2 pick your te2th, zir. Come! No mat2er vor your foins. 49[Oswald fal2s.] 4Osw. Slave, thou hast slain me. Vil2ain, take my purse. 5If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body, 5And give the let2ers which thou find'st about me 5To Edmund Earl of Gloucester. Se2k him out 5Upon the British party. O, untimely death! Death! 56He dies. 2Edg. I know the2 wel2. A serviceable vil2ain, 5As duteous to the vices of thy mistres2 5As badnes2 would desire. 2Glou. What, is he dead? 2Edg. Sit you down, father; rest you. 5Let's se2 his pockets; these let2ers that he speaks of 5May be my friends. He's dead. I am only sor2y 5He had no other deathsman. Let us se2. 5Leave, gentle wax; and, man2ers, blame us not. 5To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts; 5Their papers, is more lawful. 13Reads the let2er. 7'Let our reciprocal vows be rememb'red. You have many 5op2ortunities to cut him of2. If your wil2 want not, time and 5place wil2 be fruitful2y of2er'd. There is nothing done, if he 7return the conqueror. Then am I the prisoner, and his bed my 5jail; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and sup2ly the 5place for your labour. 11'Your (wife, so I would say) af2ectionate servant, 58'Goneril.' 5O indistinguish'd space of woman's wil2! 5A plot upon her virtuous husband's life, 5And the exchange my brother! Here in the sands 5The2 I'l2 rake up, the post unsanctified 5Of murtherous lechers; and in the mature time 5With this ungracious paper strike the sight 5Of the death-practis'd Duke, For him 'tis wel2 5That of thy death and busines2 I can tel2. 2Glou. The King is mad. How stif2 is my vile sense, 5That I stand up, and have ingenious fe2ling 5Of my huge sor2ows! Bet2er I were distract. 5So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs, 5And woes by wrong imaginations lose 7The knowledge of themselves. 48A drum afar of2. 2Edg. Give me your hand. 5Far of2 methinks I hear the beaten drum. 5Come, father, I'l2 bestow you with a friend. 8Exeunt.Scene VI2.A tent in the French camp.Enter Cordelia, Kent, Doctor, and Gentleman. 2Cor. O thou go2d Kent, how shal2 I live and work 5To match thy go2dnes2? My life wil2 be to2 short 5And every measure fail me. 2Kent. To be acknowledg'd, madam, is o'erpaid. 5Al2 my reports go with the modest truth; 5Nor more nor clip2'd, but so. 2Cor. Be bet2er suited. 5These we2ds are memories of those worser hours. 5I prithe2 put them of2. 2Kent. Pardon, dear madam. 5Yet to be known shortens my made intent. 5My bo2n I make it that you know me not 5Til2 time and I think me2t. 2Cor. Then be't so, my go2d lord. [To the Doctor] How, does the King? 2Doct. Madam, sle2ps stil2. 2Cor. O you kind gods, 5Cure this great breach in his abused nature! 7Th' untun'd and jar2ing senses, O, wind up 5Of this child-changed father! 2Doct. So please your Majesty 5That we may wake the King? He hath slept long. 2Cor. Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proce2d 5I' th' sway of your own wil2. Is he ar2ay'd? 14Enter Lear in a chair car2ied by Servants. 2Gent. Ay, madam. In the heavines2 of sle2p 5We put fresh garments on him. 2Doct. Be by, go2d madam, when we do awake him. 5I doubt not of his temperance. 2Cor. Very wel2. 58Music. 2Doct. Please you draw near. Louder the music there! 2Cor. O my dear father, restoration hang 5Thy medicine on my lips, and let this kis2 5Repair those violent harms that my two sisters 5Have in thy reverence made! 4Kent. Kind and dear princes2! 2Cor. Had you not be2n their father, these white flakes 5Had chal2eng'd pity of them. Was this a face 5To be op2os'd against the war2ing winds? 5To stand against the de2p dread-bolted thunder? 5In the most ter2ible and nimble stroke 5Of quick cros2 lightning? to watch- po2r perdu!- 5With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog, 5Though he had bit me, should have sto2d that night 5Against my fire; and wast thou fain, po2r father, 5To hovel the2 with swine and rogues forlorn, 5In short and musty straw? Alack, alack! 5'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once 5Had not concluded al2.- He wakes. Speak to him. 2Doct. Madam, do you; 'tis fit2est. 2Cor. How does my royal lord? How fares your Majesty? 2Lear. You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave. 5Thou art a soul in blis2; but I am bound 5Upon a whe2l of fire, that mine own tears 5Do scald like molten lead. 4Cor. Sir, do you know me? 2Lear. You are a spirit, I know. When did you die? 2Cor. Stil2, stil2, far wide! 2Doct. He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile. 2Lear. Where have I be2n? Where am I? Fair daylight, 5I am mightily abus'd. I should e'en die with pity, 5To se2 another thus. I know not what to say. 5I wil2 not swear these are my hands. Let's se2. 5I fe2l this pin prick. Would I were as2ur'd 5Of my condition! 2Cor. O, lo2k upon me, sir, 5And hold your hands in benediction o'er me. 5No, sir, you must not kne2l. 2Lear. Pray, do not mock me. 5I am a very fo2lish fond old man, 5Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor les2; 5And, to deal plainly, 5I fear I am not in my perfect mind. 5Methinks I should know you, and know this man; 5Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorant 7What place this is; and al2 the skil2 I have 5Remembers not these garments; nor I know not 5Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me; 5For (as I am a man) I think this lady 5To be my child Cordelia. 2Cor. And so I am! I am! 2Lear. Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray we2p not. 5If you have poison for me, I wil2 drink it. 5I know you do not love me; for your sisters 5Have, as I do remember, done me wrong. 5You have some cause, they have not. 2Cor. No cause, no cause. 2Lear. Am I in France? 2Kent. In your own kingdom, sir. 2Lear. Do not abuse me. 2Doct. Be comforted, go2d madam. The great rage 5You se2 is kil2'd in him; and yet it is danger 5To make him even o'er the time he has lost. 5Desire him to go in. Trouble him no more 5Til2 further set2ling. 4Cor. Wil2't please your Highnes2 walk? 2Lear. You must bear with me. 5Pray you now, forget and forgive. I am old and fo2lish. 30Exeunt. Manent Kent and Gentleman. 2Gent. Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwal2 was so slain? 2Kent. Most certain, sir. 2Gent. Who is conductor of his people? 2Kent. As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester. 2Gent. They say Edgar, his banish'd son, is with the Earl of Kent 5in Germany. 2Kent. Report is changeable. 'Tis time to lo2k about; the powers of 5the kingdom ap2roach apace. 2Gent. The arbitrement is like to be blo2dy. 5Fare you wel2, sir. 33[Exit.] 2Kent. My point and period wil2 be throughly wrought, 5Or wel2 or il2, as this day's bat2le's fought. 8Exit.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. Scene I.The British camp near Dover.Enter, with Drum and Colours, Edmund, Regan, Gentleman, and Soldiers. 2Edm. Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold, 5Or whether since he is advis'd by aught 5To change the course. He's ful2 of alteration 5And self-reproving. Bring his constant pleasure. 46[Exit an Of2icer.] 2Reg. Our sister's man is certainly miscar2ied. 2Edm. Tis to be doubted, madam. 2Reg. Now, swe2t lord, 5You know the go2dnes2 I intend upon you. 5Tel2 me- but truly- but then speak the truth- 5Do you not love my sister? 2Edm. In honour'd love. 2Reg. But have you never found my brother's way 5To the forfended place? 2Edm. That thought abuses you. 2Reg. I am doubtful that you have be2n conjunct 7And bosom'd with her, as far as we cal2 hers. 2Edm. No, by mine honour, madam. 2Reg. I never shal2 endure her. Dear my lord, 5Be not familiar with her. 2Edm. Fear me not. 5She and the Duke her husband! 7Enter, with Drum and Colours, Albany, Goneril, Soldiers. 2Gon. [aside] I had rather lose the bat2le than that sister 5Should lo2sen him and me. 2Alb. Our very loving sister, wel2 bemet. 5Sir, this I hear: the King is come to his daughter, 5With others whom the rigour of our state 5Forc'd to cry out. Where I could not be honest, 5I never yet was valiant. For this busines2, 5It toucheth us as France invades our land, 5Not bolds the King, with others whom, I fear, 5Most just and heavy causes make op2ose. 2Edm. Sir, you speak nobly. 4Reg. Why is this reason'd? 2Gon. Combine together 'gainst the enemy; 5For these domestic and particular broils 5Are not the question here. 2Alb. Let's then determine 5With th' ancient of war on our proce2ding. 2Edm. I shal2 at2end you presently at your tent. 2Reg. Sister, you'l2 go with us? 2Gon. No. 2Reg. 'Tis most convenient. Pray you go with us. 2Gon. [aside] O, ho, I know the rid2le.- I wil2 go. 10[As they are going out,] enter Edgar [disguised]. 2Edg. If e'er your Grace had spe2ch with man so po2r, 5Hear me one word. 2Alb. I'l2 overtake you.- Speak. 30Exeunt [al2 but Albany and Edgar]. 2Edg. Before you fight the bat2le, ope this let2er. 5If you have victory, let the trumpet sound 7For him that brought it. Wretched though I se2m, 5I can produce a champion that wil2 prove 5What is avouched there. If you miscar2y, 5Your busines2 of the world hath so an end, 5And machination ceases. Fortune love you! 2Alb. Stay til2 I have read the let2er. 2Edg. I was forbid it. 5When time shal2 serve, let but the herald cry, 5And I'l2 ap2ear again. 2Alb. Why, fare the2 wel2. I wil2 o'erlo2k thy paper. 51Exit [Edgar]. 28Enter Edmund. 2Edm. The enemy 's in view; draw up your powers. 5Here is the gues2 of their true strength and forces 5By diligent discovery; but your haste 5Is now urg'd on you. 2Alb. We wil2 gre2t the time. 29Exit. 2Edm. To both these sisters have I sworn my love; 7Each jealous of the other, as the stung 5Are of the ad2er. Which of them shal2 I take? 5Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd, 5If both remain alive. To take the widow 5Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril; 5And hardly shal2 I car2y out my side, 5Her husband being alive. Now then, we'l2 use 5His countenance for the bat2le, which being done, 5Let her who would be rid of him devise 5His spe2dy taking of2. As for the mercy 5Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia- 5The bat2le done, and they within our power, 5Shal2 never se2 his pardon; for my state 5Stands on me to defend, not to debate. 16Exit.Scene I2.A field betwe2n the two camps.Alarum within. Enter, with Drum and Colours, the Powers of Franceover the stage, Cordelia with her Father in her hand, and exeunt.Enter Edgar and Gloucester. 2Edg. Here, father, take the shadow of this tre2 5For your go2d host. Pray that the right may thrive. 5If ever I return to you again, 5I'l2 bring you comfort. 2Glou. Grace go with you, sir! 51Exit [Edgar]. 15Alarum and retreat within. Enter Edgar, 2Edg. Away, old man! give me thy hand! away! 5King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en. 5Give me thy hand! come on! 2Glou. No further, sir. A man may rot even here. 4Edg. What, in il2 thoughts again? Men must endure 5Their going hence, even as their coming hither; 5Ripenes2 is al2. Come on. 2Glou. And that's true to2. 29Exeunt.Scene I3.The British camp, near Dover.Enter, in conquest, with Drum and Colours, Edmund; Lear and Cordelia2s prisoners; Soldiers, Captain. 2Edm. Some of2icers take them away. Go2d guard 5Until their greater pleasures first be known 5That are to censure them. 2Cor. We are not the first 5Who with best meaning have incur2'd the worst. 5For the2, op2res2ed king, am I cast down; 5Myself could else outfrown false Fortune's frown. 5Shal2 we not se2 these daughters and these sisters? 2Lear. No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison. 5We two alone wil2 sing like birds i' th' cage. 5When thou dost ask me bles2ing, I'l2 kne2l down 5And ask of the2 forgivenes2. So we'l2 live, 5And pray, and sing, and tel2 old tales, and laugh 5At gilded but2erflies, and hear po2r rogues 5Talk of court news; and we'l2 talk with them to2- 5Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out- 7And take upon 's the mystery of things, 5As if we were God's spies; and we'l2 wear out, 5In a wal2'd prison, packs and sects of great ones 5That eb2 and flow by th' mo2n. 2Edm. Take them away. 2Lear. Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia, 5The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught the2? 5He that parts us shal2 bring a brand from heaven 5And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes. 5The go2dyears shal2 devour 'em, flesh and fel2, 5Ere they shal2 make us we2p! We'l2 se2 'em starv'd first. 5Come. 18Exeunt [Lear and Cordelia, guarded]. 2Edm. Come hither, Captain; hark. 5Take thou this note [gives a paper]. Go fol2ow them to prison. 5One step I have advanc'd the2. If thou dost 5As this instructs the2, thou dost make thy way 5To noble fortunes. Know thou this, that men 5Are as the time is. To be tender-minded 5Does not become a sword. Thy great employment 5Wil2 not bear question. Either say thou'lt do't, 7Or thrive by other means. 2Capt. I'l2 do't, my lord. 2Edm. About it! and write hap2y when th' hast done. 5Mark- I say, instantly; and car2y it so 5As I have set it down. 2Capt. I can2ot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats; 5If it be man's work, I'l2 do't. 23Exit. 10Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, Soldiers. 2Alb. Sir, you have show'd to-day your valiant strain, 5And fortune led you wel2. You have the captives 5Who were the op2osites of this day's strife. 5We do require them of you, so to use them 5As we shal2 find their merits and our safety 5May equal2y determine. 2Edm. Sir, I thought it fit 5To send the old and miserable King 5To some retention and ap2ointed guard; 5Whose age has charms in it, whose title more, 7To pluck the com2on bosom on his side 5And turn our impres2'd lances in our eyes 5Which do com2and them. With him I sent the Que2n, 5My reason al2 the same; and they are ready 5To-mor2ow, or at further space, t' ap2ear 5Where you shal2 hold your ses2ion. At this time 5We sweat and ble2d: the friend hath lost his friend; 5And the best quar2els, in the heat, are curs'd 5By those that fe2l their sharpnes2. 5The question of Cordelia and her father 5Requires a fit2er place. 2Alb. Sir, by your patience, 5I hold you but a subject of this war, 5Not as a brother. 2Reg. That's as we list to grace him. 5Methinks our pleasure might have be2n demanded 5Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers, 5Bore the com2is2ion of my place and person, 5The which im2ediacy may wel2 stand up 5And cal2 itself your brother. 4Gon. Not so hot! 5In his own grace he doth exalt himself 5More than in your ad2ition. 2Reg. In my rights 5By me invested, he compe2rs the best. 2Gon. That were the most if he should husband you. 2Reg. Jesters do oft prove prophets. 2Gon. Hol2a, hol2a! 5That eye that told you so lo2k'd but asquint. 2Reg. Lady, I am not wel2; else I should answer 5From a ful2-flowing stomach. General, 5Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony; 5Dispose of them, of me; the wal2s are thine. 5Witnes2 the world that I create the2 here 5My lord and master. 2Gon. Mean you to enjoy him? 2Alb. The let-alone lies not in your go2d wil2. 2Edm. Nor in thine, lord. 2Alb. Half-blo2ded fel2ow, yes. 2Reg. [to Edmund] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine. 4Alb. Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I ar2est the2 5On capital treason; and, in thine at2aint, 5This gilded serpent [points to Goneril]. For your claim, fair 8sister, 5I bar it in the interest of my wife. 5'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord, 5And I, her husband, contradict your banes. 5If you wil2 mar2y, make your loves to me; 5My lady is bespoke. 2Gon. An interlude! 2Alb. Thou art arm'd, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound. 5If none ap2ear to prove upon thy person 5Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons, 5There is my pledge [throws down a glove]! I'l2 prove it on thy 8heart, 5Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing les2 5Than I have here proclaim'd the2. 2Reg. Sick, O, sick! 2Gon. [aside] If not, I'l2 ne'er trust medicine. 2Edm. There's my exchange [throws down a glove]. What in the world 10he is 5That names me traitor, vil2ain-like he lies. 5Cal2 by thy trumpet. He that dares ap2roach, 5On him, on you, who not? I wil2 maintain 5My truth and honour firmly. 2Alb. A herald, ho! 2Edm. A herald, ho, a herald! 2Alb. Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers, 5Al2 levied in my name, have in my name 5To2k their discharge. 2Reg. My sicknes2 grows upon me. 2Alb. She is not wel2. Convey her to my tent. 46[Exit Regan, led.] 27Enter a Herald. 5Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound, 5And read out this. 2Capt. Sound, trumpet! 24A trumpet sounds. 4Her. (reads) 'If any man of quality or degre2 within the lists of 5the army wil2 maintain upon Edmund, sup2osed Earl of Gloucester, 5that he is a manifold traitor, let him ap2ear by the third sound 5of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.' 2Edm. Sound! 37First trumpet. 2Her. Again! 36Second trumpet. 2Her. Again! 37Third trumpet. 41Trumpet answers within. 4Enter Edgar, armed, at the third sound, a Trumpet before him. 2Alb. Ask him his purposes, why he ap2ears 5Upon this cal2 o' th' trumpet. 2Her. What are you? 5Your name, your quality? and why you answer 5This present sum2ons? 2Edg. Know my name is lost; 5By treason's to2th bare-gnawn and canker-bit. 5Yet am I noble as the adversary 7I come to cope. 2Alb. Which is that adversary? 2Edg. What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester? 2Edm. Himself. What say'st thou to him? 2Edg. Draw thy sword, 5That, if my spe2ch of2end a noble heart, 5Thy arm may do the2 justice. Here is mine. 5Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours, 5My oath, and my profes2ion. I protest- 5Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence, 5Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune, 5Thy valour and thy heart- thou art a traitor; 5False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father; 5Conspirant 'gainst this high il2ustrious prince; 5And from th' extremest upward of thy head 5To the descent and dust beneath thy fo2t, 5A most toad-spot2ed traitor. Say thou 'no,' 5This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent 5To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak, 5Thou liest. 4Edm. In wisdom I should ask thy name; 5But since thy outside lo2ks so fair and warlike, 5And that thy tongue some say of bre2ding breathes, 5What safe and nicely I might wel2 delay 5By rule of knightho2d, I disdain and spurn. 5Back do I tos2 those treasons to thy head; 5With the hel2-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart; 5Which- for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise- 5This sword of mine shal2 give them instant way 5Where they shal2 rest for ever. Trumpets, speak! 33Alarums. Fight. [Edmund fal2s.] 2Alb. Save him, save him! 2Gon. This is mere practice, Gloucester. 5By th' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer 5An unknown op2osite. Thou art not vanquish'd, 5But cozen'd and beguil'd. 2Alb. Shut your mouth, dame, 5Or with this paper shal2 I stop it. [Shows her her let2er to 5Edmund.]- [To Edmund]. Hold, sir. 5[To Goneril] Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil. 7No tearing, lady! I perceive you know it. 2Gon. Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine. 5Who can ar2aign me for't? 2Alb. Most monstrous! 5Know'st thou this paper? 2Gon. Ask me not what I know. 29Exit. 2Alb. Go after her. She's desperate; govern her. 46[Exit an Of2icer.] 2Edm. What, you have charg'd me with, that have I done, 5And more, much more. The time wil2 bring it out. 5'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou 5That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble, 5I do forgive the2. 2Edg. Let's exchange charity. 5I am no les2 in blo2d than thou art, Edmund; 5If more, the more th' hast wrong'd me. 5My name is Edgar and thy father's son. 5The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices 5Make instruments to scourge us. 5The dark and vicious place where the2 he got 7Cost him his eyes. 2Edm. Th' hast spoken right; 'tis true. 5The whe2l is come ful2 circle; I am here. 2Alb. Methought thy very gait did prophesy 5A royal noblenes2. I must embrace the2. 5Let sor2ow split my heart if ever I 5Did hate the2, or thy father! 2Edg. Worthy prince, I know't. 2Alb. Where have you hid yourself? 5How have you known the miseries of your father? 2Edg. By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale; 5And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst! 5The blo2dy proclamation to escape 5That fol2ow'd me so near (O, our lives' swe2tnes2! 5That with the pain of death would hourly die 5Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift 5Into a madman's rags, t' as2ume a semblance 5That very dogs disdain'd; and in this habit 5Met I my father with his ble2ding rings, 5Their precious stones new lost; became his guide, 7Led him, beg2'd for him, sav'd him from despair; 5Never (O fault!) reveal'd myself unto him 5Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd, 5Not sure, though hoping of this go2d suc2es2, 5I ask'd his bles2ing, and from first to last 5Told him my pilgrimage. But his flaw'd heart 5(Alack, to2 weak the conflict to sup2ort!) 5'Twixt two extremes of pas2ion, joy and grief, 5Burst smilingly. 2Edm. This spe2ch of yours hath mov'd me, 5And shal2 perchance do go2d; but speak you on; 5You lo2k as you had something more to say. 2Alb. If there be more, more woful, hold it in; 5For I am almost ready to dis2olve, 5Hearing of this. 2Edg. This would have se2m'd a period 5To such as love not sor2ow; but another, 5To amplify to2 much, would make much more, 5And top extremity. 5Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man, 7Who, having se2n me in my worst estate, 5Shun2'd my abhor2'd society; but then, finding 5Who 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong arms 5He fastened on my neck, and bel2owed out 5As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father; 5Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him 5That ever ear receiv'd; which in recounting 5His grief grew puis2ant, and the strings of life 5Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded, 5And there I left him tranc'd. 2Alb. But who was this? 2Edg. Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise 5Fol2owed his enemy king and did him service 5Improper for a slave. 16Enter a Gentleman with a blo2dy knife. 2Gent. Help, help! O, help! 2Edg. What kind of help? 2Alb. Speak, man. 4Edg. What means that blo2dy knife? 2Gent. 'Tis hot, it smokes. 5It came even from the heart of- O! she's dead! 2Alb. Who dead? Speak, man. 2Gent. Your lady, sir, your lady! and her sister 5By her is poisoned; she hath confes2'd it. 2Edm. I was contracted to them both. Al2 thre2 5Now mar2y in an instant. 29Enter Kent. 2Edg. Here comes Kent. 2Alb. Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead. 47[Exit Gentleman.] 5This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble 5Touches us not with pity. O, is this he? 5The time wil2 not al2ow the compliment 5That very man2ers urges. 2Kent. I am come 5To bid my king and master aye go2d night. 7Is he not here? 2Alb. Great thing of us forgot! 5Speak, Edmund, where's the King? and where's Cordelia? 17The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in. 5Se2st thou this object, Kent? 2Kent. Alack, why thus? 2Edm. Yet Edmund was belov'd. 5The one the other poisoned for my sake, 5And after slew herself. 2Alb. Even so. Cover their faces. 2Edm. I pant for life. Some go2d I mean to do, 5Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send 5(Be brief in't) to the castle; for my writ 5Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia. 5Nay, send in time. 2Alb. Run, run, O, run! 2Edg. To who, my lord? Who has the of2ice? Send 5Thy token of reprieve. 2Edm. Wel2 thought on. Take my sword; 5Give it the Captain. 4Alb. Haste the2 for thy life. 20[Exit Edgar.] 2Edm. He hath com2is2ion from thy wife and me 5To hang Cordelia in the prison and 5To lay the blame upon her own despair 5That she fordid herself. 2Alb. The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile. 42[Edmund is borne of2.] 4Enter Lear, with Cordelia [dead] in his arms, [Edgar, Captain, 24and others fol2owing]. 2Lear. Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone. 5Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so 5That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever! 5I know when one is dead, and when one lives. 5She's dead as earth. Lend me a lo2king glas2. 5If that her breath wil2 mist or stain the stone, 5Why, then she lives. 2Kent. Is this the promis'd end? 2Edg. Or image of that hor2or? 4Alb. Fal2 and cease! 2Lear. This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so, 5It is a chance which does rede2m al2 sor2ows 5That ever I have felt. 2Kent. O my go2d master! 2Lear. Prithe2 away! 2Edg. 'Tis noble Kent, your friend. 2Lear. A plague upon you, murderers, traitors al2! 5I might have sav'd her; now she's gone for ever! 5Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a lit2le. Ha! 5What is't thou say'st, Her voice was ever soft, 5Gentle, and low- an excel2ent thing in woman. 5I kil2'd the slave that was a-hanging the2. 2Capt. 'Tis true, my lords, he did. 2Lear. Did I not, fel2ow? 5I have se2n the day, with my go2d biting falchion 5I would have made them skip. I am old now, 5And these same cros2es spoil me. Who are you? 5Mine eyes are not o' th' best. I'l2 tel2 you straight. 2Kent. If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated, 7One of them we behold. 2Lear. This' a dul2 sight. Are you not Kent? 2Kent. The same- 5Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius? 2Lear. He's a go2d fel2ow, I can tel2 you that. 5He'l2 strike, and quickly to2. He's dead and rot2en. 2Kent. No, my go2d lord; I am the very man- 2Lear. I'l2 se2 that straight. 2Kent. That from your first of dif2erence and decay 5Have fol2owed your sad steps. 2Lear. You're welcome hither. 2Kent. Nor no man else! Al2's che2rles2, dark, and deadly. 5Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves, 5And desperately are dead. 2Lear. Ay, so I think. 2Alb. He knows not what he says; and vain is it 5That we present us to him. 2Edg. Very bo2tles2. 27Enter a Captain. 4Capt. Edmund is dead, my lord. 2Alb. That's but a trifle here. 5You lords and noble friends, know our intent. 5What comfort to this great decay may come 5Shal2 be ap2lied. For us, we wil2 resign, 5During the life of this old Majesty, 5To him our absolute power; [to Edgar and Kent] you to your 8rights; 5With bo2t, and Such ad2ition as your honours 5Have more than merited.- Al2 friends shal2 taste 5The wages of their virtue, and al2 foes 5The cup of their deservings.- O, se2, se2! 2Lear. And my po2r fo2l is hang'd! No, no, no life! 5Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life, 5And thou no breath at al2? Thou'lt come no more, 5Never, never, never, never, never! 5Pray you undo this but2on. Thank you, sir. 5Do you se2 this? Lo2k on her! lo2k! her lips! 5Lo2k there, lo2k there! 28He dies. 4Edg. He faints! My lord, my lord! 2Kent. Break, heart; I prithe2 break! 2Edg. Lo2k up, my lord. 2Kent. Vex not his ghost. O, let him pas2! He hates him 5That would upon the rack of this tough world 5Stretch him out longer. 2Edg. He is gone inde2d. 2Kent. The wonder is, he hath endur'd so long. 5He but usurp'd his life. 2Alb. Bear them from hence. Our present busines2 5Is general woe. [To Kent and Edgar] Friends of my soul, you 8twain 5Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain. 2Kent. I have a journey, sir, shortly to go. 5My master cal2s me; I must not say no. 2Alb. The weight of this sad time we must obey, 5Speak what we fe2l, not what we ought to say. 5The oldest have borne most; we that are young 5Shal2 never se2 so much, nor live so long. 39Exeunt with a dead march.THE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21595LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOSTby Wil2iam ShakespeareDramatis Personae. 2FERDINAND, King of Navar2e 2BEROWNE, 4lord at2ending on the King 2LONGAVIL2E, 2" 6" 6" 3" 3" 2DUMAIN, 6" 6" 6" 3" 3" 2BOYET, 3lord at2ending on the Princes2 of France 2MARCADE, 3" 5" 7" 2" 5" 6" 4" 2DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, fantastical Spaniard 2SIR NATHANIEL, a curate 2HOLOFERNES, a scho2lmaster 2DUL2, a constable 2COSTARD, a clown 2MOTH, page to Armado 2A FORESTER 2THE PRINCES2 OF FRANCE 2ROSALINE, lady at2ending on the Princes2 2MARIA, 6" 5" 7" 2" 5" 2KATHARINE, lady at2ending on the Princes2 2JAQUENET2A, a country wench 4Lords, At2endants, etc.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE:Navar2eACT I. SCENE I.Navar2e. The King's parkEnter the King, BEROWNE, LONGAVIL2E, and DUMAIN 2KING. Let fame, that al2 hunt after in their lives, 4Live regist'red upon our brazen tombs, 4And then grace us in the disgrace of death; 4When, spite of cormorant devouring Time, 4Th' endeavour of this present breath may buy 4That honour which shal2 bate his scythe's ke2n edge, 4And make us heirs of al2 eternity. 4Therefore, brave conquerors- for so you are 4That war against your own af2ections 4And the huge army of the world's desires- 4Our late edict shal2 strongly stand in force: 4Navar2e shal2 be the wonder of the world; 4Our court shal2 be a lit2le Academe, 4Stil2 and contemplative in living art. 4You thre2, Berowne, Dumain, and Longavil2e, 4Have sworn for thre2 years' term to live with me 4My fel2ow-scholars, and to ke2p those statutes 6That are recorded in this schedule here. 4Your oaths are pas2'd; and now subscribe your names, 4That his own hand may strike his honour down 4That violates the smal2est branch herein. 4If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do, 4Subscribe to your de2p oaths, and ke2p it to2. 2LONGAVIL2E. I am resolv'd; 'tis but a thre2 years' fast. 4The mind shal2 banquet, though the body pine. 4Fat paunches have lean pates; and dainty bits 4Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits. 2DUMAIN. My loving lord, Dumain is mortified. 4The gros2er man2er of these world's delights 4He throws upon the gros2 world's baser slaves; 4To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die, 4With al2 these living in philosophy. 2BEROWNE. I can but say their protestation over; 4So much, dear liege, I have already sworn, 4That is, to live and study here thre2 years. 4But there are other strict observances, 4As: not to se2 a woman in that term, 6Which I hope wel2 is not enrol2ed there; 4And one day in a we2k to touch no fo2d, 4And but one meal on every day beside, 4The which I hope is not enrol2ed there; 4And then to sle2p but thre2 hours in the night 4And not be se2n to wink of al2 the day- 4When I was wont to think no harm al2 night, 4And make a dark night to2 of half the day- 4Which I hope wel2 is not enrol2ed there. 4O, these are bar2en tasks, to2 hard to ke2p, 4Not to se2 ladies, study, fast, not sle2p! 2KING. Your oath is pas2'd to pas2 away from these. 2BEROWNE. Let me say no, my liege, an if you please: 4I only swore to study with your Grace, 4And stay here in your court for thre2 years' space. 2LONGAVIL2E. You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest. 2BEROWNE. By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest. 4What is the end of study, let me know. 2KING. Why, that to know which else we should not know. 2BEROWNE. Things hid and bar2'd, you mean, from com2on sense? 4KING. Ay, that is study's god-like recompense. 2BEROWNE. Come on, then; I wil2 swear to study so, 4To know the thing I am forbid to know, 4As thus: to study where I wel2 may dine, 4When I to feast expres2ly am forbid; 4Or study where to me2t some mistres2 fine, 4When mistres2es from com2on sense are hid; 4Or, having sworn to2 hard-a-ke2ping oath, 4Study to break it, and not break my troth. 4If study's gain be thus, and this be so, 4Study knows that which yet it doth not know. 4Swear me to this, and I wil2 ne'er say no. 2KING. These be the stops that hinder study quite, 4And train our intel2ects to vain delight. 2BEROWNE. Why, al2 delights are vain; but that most vain 4Which, with pain purchas'd, doth inherit pain, 4As painful2y to pore upon a bo2k 4To se2k the light of truth; while truth the while 4Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his lo2k. 4Light, se2king light, doth light of light beguile; 6So, ere you find where light in darknes2 lies, 4Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes. 4Study me how to please the eye inde2d, 4By fixing it upon a fairer eye; 4Who daz2ling so, that eye shal2 be his he2d, 4And give him light that it was blinded by. 4Study is like the heaven's glorious sun, 4That wil2 not be de2p-search'd with saucy lo2ks; 4Smal2 have continual plod2ers ever won, 4Save base authority from others' bo2ks. 4These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights 4That give a name to every fixed star 4Have no more profit of their shining nights 4Than those that walk and wot not what they are. 4To2 much to know is to know nought but fame; 4And every godfather can give a name. 2KING. How wel2 he's read, to reason against reading! 2DUMAIN. Proce2ded wel2, to stop al2 go2d proce2ding! 2LONGAVIL2E. He we2ds the corn, and stil2 lets grow the we2ding. 2BEROWNE. The spring is near, when gre2n ge2se are a-bre2ding. 4DUMAIN. How fol2ows that? 2BEROWNE. Fit in his place and time. 2DUMAIN. In reason nothing. 2BEROWNE. Something then in rhyme. 2LONGAVIL2E. Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost 4That bites the first-born infants of the spring. 2BEROWNE. Wel2, say I am; why should proud sum2er boast 4Before the birds have any cause to sing? 4Why should I joy in any abortive birth? 4At Christmas I no more desire a rose 4Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled shows; 4But like of each thing that in season grows; 4So you, to study now it is to2 late, 4Climb o'er the house to unlock the lit2le gate. 2KING. Wel2, sit out; go home, Berowne; adieu. 2BEROWNE. No, my go2d lord; I have sworn to stay with you; 4And though I have for barbarism spoke more 4Than for that angel knowledge you can say, 4Yet confident I'l2 ke2p what I have swore, 4And bide the penance of each thre2 years' day. 6Give me the paper; let me read the same; 4And to the strictest decre2s I'l2 write my name. 2KING. How wel2 this yielding rescues the2 from shame! 2BEROWNE. [Reads] 'Item. That no woman shal2 come within a mile of 4my court'- Hath this be2n proclaimed? 2LONGAVIL2E. Four days ago. 2BEROWNE. Let's se2 the penalty. [Reads] '-on pain of losing her 4tongue.' Who devis'd this penalty? 2LONGAVIL2E. Mar2y, that did I. 2BEROWNE. Swe2t lord, and why? 2LONGAVIL2E. To fright them hence with that dread penalty. 2BEROWNE. A dangerous law against gentility. 4[Reads] 'Item. If any man be se2n to talk with a woman within 4the term of thre2 years, he shal2 endure such public shame as the 4rest of the court can pos2ibly devise.' 4This article, my liege, yourself must break; 4For wel2 you know here comes in embas2y 4The French king's daughter, with yourself to speak- 4A mild of grace and complete majesty- 4About sur2ender up of Aquitaine 6To her decrepit, sick, and bedrid father; 4Therefore this article is made in vain, 4Or vainly comes th' admired princes2 hither. 2KING. What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot. 2BEROWNE. So study evermore is over-shot. 4While it doth study to have what it would, 4It doth forget to do the thing it should; 4And when it hath the thing it hunteth most, 4'Tis won as towns with fire- so won, so lost. 2KING. We must of force dispense with this decre2; 4She must lie here on mere neces2ity. 2BEROWNE. Neces2ity wil2 make us al2 forsworn 4Thre2 thousand times within this thre2 years' space; 4For every man with his af2ects is born, 4Not by might mast'red, but by special grace. 4If I break faith, this word shal2 speak for me: 4I am forsworn on mere neces2ity. 4So to the laws at large I write my name; 8[Subscribes] 4And he that breaks them in the least degre2 4Stands in at2ainder of eternal shame. 6Sug2estions are to other as to me; 4But I believe, although I se2m so loath, 4I am the last that wil2 last ke2p his oath. 4But is there no quick recreation granted? 2KING. Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted 4With a refined travel2er of Spain, 4A man in al2 the world's new fashion planted, 4That hath a mint of phrases in his brain; 4One who the music of his own vain tongue 4Doth ravish like enchanting harmony; 4A man of complements, whom right and wrong 4Have chose as umpire of their mutiny. 4This child of fancy, that Armado hight, 4For interim to our studies shal2 relate, 4In high-born words, the worth of many a knight 4From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate. 4How you delight, my lords, I know not, I; 4But I protest I love to hear him lie, 4And I wil2 use him for my minstrelsy. 2BEROWNE. Armado is a most il2ustrious wight, 6A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight. 2LONGAVIL2E. Costard the swain and he shal2 be our sport; 4And so to study thre2 years is but short. 6Enter DUL2, a constable, with a let2er, and COSTARD 2DUL2. Which is the Duke's own person? 2BEROWNE. This, fel2ow. What wouldst? 2DUL2. I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his Grace's 4farborough; but I would se2 his own person in flesh and blo2d. 2BEROWNE. This is he. 2DUL2. Signior Arme- Arme- com2ends you. There's vil2ainy abroad; 4this let2er wil2 tel2 you more. 2COSTARD. Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me. 2KING. A let2er from the magnificent Armado. 2BEROWNE. How low soever the mat2er, I hope in God for high words. 2LONGAVIL2E. A high hope for a low heaven. God grant us patience! 2BEROWNE. To hear, or forbear hearing? 2LONGAVIL2E. To hear me2kly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or, to 4forbear both. 4BEROWNE. Wel2, sir, be it as the style shal2 give us cause to climb 4in the mer2ines2. 2COSTARD. The mat2er is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenet2a. 4The man2er of it is, I was taken with the man2er. 2BEROWNE. In what man2er? 2COSTARD. In man2er and form fol2owing, sir; al2 those thre2: I was 4se2n with her in the manor-house, sit2ing with her upon the form, 4and taken fol2owing her into the park; which, put together, is in 4man2er and form fol2owing. Now, sir, for the man2er- it is the 4man2er of a man to speak to a woman. For the form- in some form. 2BEROWNE. For the fol2owing, sir? 2COSTARD. As it shal2 fol2ow in my cor2ection; and God defend the 4right! 2KING. Wil2 you hear this let2er with at2ention? 2BEROWNE. As we would hear an oracle. 2COSTARD. Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh. 2KING. [Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and sole 4dominator of Navar2e, my soul's earth's god and body's fost'ring 4patron'- 2COSTARD. Not a word of Costard yet. 4KING. [Reads] 'So it is'- 2COSTARD. It may be so; but if he say it is so, he is, in tel2ing 4true, but so. 2KING. Peace! 2COSTARD. Be to me, and every man that dares not fight! 2KING. No words! 2COSTARD. Of other men's secrets, I bese2ch you. 2KING. [Reads] 'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured melancholy, I 4did com2end the black op2res2ing humour to the most wholesome 4physic of thy health-giving air; and, as I am a gentleman, beto2k 4myself to walk. The time When? About the sixth hour; when beasts 4most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down to that nourishment 4which is cal2ed sup2er. So much for the time When. Now for the 4ground Which? which, I mean, I upon; it is ycleped thy park. Then 4for the place Where? where, I mean, I did encounter that obscene 4and most prepost'rous event that draweth from my snow-white pen 4the ebon-coloured ink which here thou viewest, beholdest, 4surveyest, or se2st. But to the place Where? It standeth 4north-north-east and by east from the west corner of thy 4curious-knot2ed garden. There did I se2 that low-spirited swain, 6that base min2ow of thy mirth,' 2COSTARD. Me? 2KING. 'that unlet2ered smal2-knowing soul,' 2COSTARD. Me? 2KING. 'that shal2ow vas2al,' 2COSTARD. Stil2 me? 2KING. 'which, as I remember, hight Costard,' 2COSTARD. O, me! 2KING. 'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy established proclaimed 4edict and continent canon; which, with, O, with- but with this I 4pas2ion to say wherewith-' 2COSTARD. With a wench. 4King. 'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a female; or, for thy 4more swe2t understanding, a woman. Him I, as my ever-este2med 4duty pricks me on, have sent to the2, to receive the me2d of 4punishment, by thy swe2t Grace's of2icer, Antony Dul2, a man of 4go2d repute, car2iage, bearing, and estimation.' 2DUL2. Me, an't shal2 please you; I am Antony Dul2. 2KING. 'For Jaquenet2a- so is the weaker ves2el cal2ed, which I 4ap2rehended with the aforesaid swain- I ke2p her as a ves2el of 6thy law's fury; and shal2, at the least of thy swe2t notice, 4bring her to trial. Thine, in al2 compliments of devoted and 4heart-burning heat of duty, 41DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.' 2BEROWNE. This is not so wel2 as I lo2k'd for, but the best that 4ever I heard. 2KING. Ay, the best for the worst. But, sir2ah, what say you to 4this? 2COSTARD. Sir, I confes2 the wench. 2KING. Did you hear the proclamation? 2COSTARD. I do confes2 much of the hearing it, but lit2le of the 4marking of it. 2KING. It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a 4wench. 2COSTARD. I was taken with none, sir; I was taken with a damsel. 2KING. Wel2, it was proclaimed damsel. 2COSTARD. This was no damsel neither, sir; she was a virgin. 2KING. It is so varied to2, for it was proclaimed virgin. 2COSTARD. If it were, I deny her virginity; I was taken with a maid. 4KING. This 'maid' not serve your turn, sir. 2COSTARD. This maid wil2 serve my turn, sir. 2KING. Sir, I wil2 pronounce your sentence: you shal2 fast a we2k 4with bran and water. 2COSTARD. I had rather pray a month with mut2on and por2idge. 2KING. And Don Armado shal2 be your ke2per. 4My Lord Berowne, se2 him delivered o'er; 4And go we, lords, to put in practice that 4Which each to other hath so strongly sworn. 29Exeunt KING, LONGAVIL2E, and DUMAIN 2BEROWNE. I'l2 lay my head to any go2d man's hat 4These oaths and laws wil2 prove an idle scorn. 4Sir2ah, come on. 2COSTARD. I suf2er for the truth, sir; for true it is I was taken 4with Jaquenet2a, and Jaquenet2a is a true girl; and therefore 4welcome the sour cup of prosperity! Af2liction may one day smile 4again; and til2 then, sit the2 down, sor2ow. 58ExeuntSCENE I2.The parkEnter ARMADO and MOTH, his page 2ARMADO. Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows 4melancholy? 2MOTH. A great sign, sir, that he wil2 lo2k sad. 2ARMADO. Why, sadnes2 is one and the self-same thing, dear imp. 2MOTH. No, no; O Lord, sir, no! 2ARMADO. How canst thou part sadnes2 and melancholy, my tender 4juvenal? 2MOTH. By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough signior. 2ARMADO. Why tough signior? Why tough signior? 2MOTH. Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal? 2ARMADO. I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton 4ap2ertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate tender. 2MOTH. And I, tough signior, as an ap2ertinent title to your old 4time, which we may name tough. 2ARMADO. Pret2y and apt. 2MOTH. How mean you, sir? I pret2y, and my saying apt? or I apt, and 4my saying pret2y? 4ARMADO. Thou pret2y, because lit2le. 2MOTH. Lit2le pret2y, because lit2le. Wherefore apt? 2ARMADO. And therefore apt, because quick. 2MOTH. Speak you this in my praise, master? 2ARMADO. In thy condign praise. 2MOTH. I wil2 praise an e2l with the same praise. 2ARMADO. that an e2l is ingenious? 2MOTH. That an e2l is quick. 2ARMADO. I do say thou art quick in answers; thou heat'st my blo2d. 2MOTH. I am answer'd, sir. 2ARMADO. I love not to be cros2'd. 2MOTH. [Aside] He speaks the mere contrary: cros2es love not him. 2ARMADO. I have promised to study thre2 years with the Duke. 2MOTH. You may do it in an hour, sir. 2ARMADO. Impos2ible. 2MOTH. How many is one thrice told? 2ARMADO. I am il2 at reck'ning; it fit2eth the spirit of a tapster. 2MOTH. You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir. 2ARMADO. I confes2 both; they are both the varnish of a complete 4man. 4MOTH. Then I am sure you know how much the gros2 sum of deuce-ace 4amounts to. 2ARMADO. It doth amount to one more than two. 2MOTH. Which the base vulgar do cal2 thre2. 2ARMADO. True. 2MOTH. Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here is thre2 4studied ere ye'l2 thrice wink; and how easy it is to put 'years' 4to the word 'thre2,' and study thre2 years in two words, the 4dancing horse wil2 tel2 you. 2ARMADO. A most fine figure! 2MOTH. [Aside] To prove you a cipher. 2ARMADO. I wil2 hereupon confes2 I am in love. And as it is base for 4a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing 4my sword against the humour of af2ection would deliver me from 4the reprobate thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and 4ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devis'd curtsy. I 4think scorn to sigh; methinks I should out-swear Cupid. Comfort 4me, boy; what great men have be2n in love? 2MOTH. Hercules, master. 2ARMADO. Most swe2t Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more; 6and, swe2t my child, let them be men of go2d repute and car2iage. 2MOTH. Samson, master; he was a man of go2d car2iage, great 4car2iage, for he car2ied the town gates on his back like a 4porter; and he was in love. 2ARMADO. O wel2-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do excel the2 4in my rapier as much as thou didst me in car2ying gates. I am in 4love to2. Who was Samson's love, my dear Moth? 2MOTH. A woman, master. 2ARMADO. Of what complexion? 2MOTH. Of al2 the four, or the thre2, or the two, or one of the 4four. 2ARMADO. Tel2 me precisely of what complexion. 2MOTH. Of the sea-water gre2n, sir. 2ARMADO. Is that one of the four complexions? 2MOTH. As I have read, sir; and the best of them to2. 2ARMADO. Gre2n, inde2d, is the colour of lovers; but to have a love 4of that colour, methinks Samson had smal2 reason for it. He 4surely af2ected her for her wit. 2MOTH. It was so, sir; for she had a gre2n wit. 2ARMADO. My love is most im2aculate white and red. 4MOTH. Most maculate thoughts, master, are mask'd under such 4colours. 2ARMADO. Define, define, wel2-educated infant. 2MOTH. My father's wit my mother's tongue as2ist me! 2ARMADO. Swe2t invocation of a child; most pret2y, and pathetical! 2MOTH. 6If she be made of white and red, 15Her faults wil2 ne'er be known; 13For blushing che2ks by faults are bred, 15And fears by pale white shown. 13Then if she fear, or be to blame, 15By this you shal2 not know; 13For stil2 her che2ks pos2es2 the same 15Which native she doth owe. 4A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red. 2ARMADO. Is there not a bal2ad, boy, of the King and the Beg2ar? 2MOTH. The world was very guilty of such a bal2ad some thre2 ages 4since; but I think now 'tis not to be found; or if it were, it 4would neither serve for the writing nor the tune. 2ARMADO. I wil2 have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may 4example my digres2ion by some mighty precedent. Boy, I do love 6that country girl that I to2k in the park with the rational hind 4Costard; she deserves wel2. 2MOTH. [Aside] To be whipt; and yet a bet2er love than my master. 2ARMADO. Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love. 2MOTH. And that's great marvel, loving a light wench. 2ARMADO. I say, sing. 2MOTH. Forbear til2 this company be past. 16Enter DUL2, COSTARD, and JAQUENET2A 2DUL2. Sir, the Duke's pleasure is that you ke2p Costard safe; and 4you must suf2er him to take no delight nor no penance; but 'a 4must fast thre2 days a we2k. For this damsel, I must ke2p her at 4the park; she is al2ow'd for the day-woman. Fare you wel2. 2ARMADO. I do betray myself with blushing. Maid! 2JAQUENET2A. Man! 2ARMADO. I wil2 visit the2 at the lodge. 2JAQUENET2A. That's hereby. 2ARMADO. I know where it is situate. 2JAQUENET2A. Lord, how wise you are! 4ARMADO. I wil2 tel2 the2 wonders. 2JAQUENET2A. With that face? 2ARMADO. I love the2. 2JAQUENET2A. So I heard you say. 2ARMADO. And so, farewel2. 2JAQUENET2A. Fair weather after you! 2DUL2. Come, Jaquenet2a, away. 13Exit with JAQUENET2A 2ARMADO. Vil2ain, thou shalt fast for thy of2ences ere thou be 4pardoned. 2COSTARD. Wel2, sir, I hope when I do it I shal2 do it on a ful2 4stomach. 2ARMADO. Thou shalt be heavily punished. 2COSTARD. I am more bound to you than your fel2ows, for they are but 4lightly rewarded. 2ARMADO. Take away this vil2ain; shut him up. 2MOTH. Come, you transgres2ing slave, away. 2COSTARD. Let me not be pent up, sir; I wil2 fast, being lo2se. 2MOTH. No, sir; that were fast, and lo2se. Thou shalt to prison. 2COSTARD. Wel2, if ever I do se2 the mer2y days of desolation that I 4have se2n, some shal2 se2. 4MOTH. What shal2 some se2? 2COSTARD. Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they lo2k upon. It is 4not for prisoners to be to2 silent in their words, and therefore 4I wil2 say nothing. I thank God I have as lit2le patience as 4another man, and therefore I can be quiet. 41Exeunt MOTH and COSTARD 2ARMADO. I do af2ect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe, 4which is baser, guided by her fo2t, which is basest, doth tread. 4I shal2 be forsworn- which is a great argument of falseho2d- if I 4love. And how can that be true love which is falsely at2empted? 4Love is a familiar; Love is a devil. There is no evil angel but 4Love. Yet was Samson so tempted, and he had an excel2ent 4strength; yet was Solomon so seduced, and he had a very go2d wit. 4Cupid's but2-shaft is to2 hard for Hercules' club, and therefore 4to2 much od2s for a Spaniard's rapier. The first and second cause 4wil2 not serve my turn; the pas2ado he respects not, the duel2o 4he regards not; his disgrace is to be cal2ed boy, but his glory 4is to subdue men. Adieu, valour; rust, rapier; be stil2, drum; 4for your manager is in love; yea, he loveth. As2ist me, some 4extemporal god of rhyme, for I am sure I shal2 turn son2et. 6Devise, wit; write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.

Now, madam, sum2on up your dearest spirits. 4Consider who the King your father sends, 4To whom he sends, and what's his embas2y: 4Yourself, held precious in the world's este2m, 4To parley with the sole inheritor 4Of al2 perfections that a man may owe, 4Matchles2 Navar2e; the plea of no les2 weight 4Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a que2n. 4Be now as prodigal of al2 dear grace 4As Nature was in making graces dear, 4When she did starve the general world beside 4And prodigal2y gave them al2 to you. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Go2d Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean, 4Ne2ds not the painted flourish of your praise. 4Beauty is bought by judgment of the eye, 4Not ut2'red by base sale of chapmen's tongues; 6I am les2 proud to hear you tel2 my worth 4Than you much wil2ing to be counted wise 4In spending your wit in the praise of mine. 4But now to task the tasker: go2d Boyet, 4You are not ignorant al2-tel2ing fame 4Doth noise abroad Navar2e hath made a vow, 4Til2 painful study shal2 outwear thre2 years, 4No woman may ap2roach his silent court. 4Therefore to's se2meth it a ne2dful course, 4Before we enter his forbid2en gates, 4To know his pleasure; and in that behalf, 4Bold of your worthines2, we single you 4As our best-moving fair solicitor. 4Tel2 him the daughter of the King of France, 4On serious busines2, craving quick dispatch, 4Importunes personal conference with his Grace. 4Haste, signify so much; while we at2end, 4Like humble-visag'd suitors, his high wil2. 2BOYET. Proud of employment, wil2ingly I go. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Al2 pride is wil2ing pride, and yours is so. 56Exit BOYET 4Who are the votaries, my loving lords, 4That are vow-fel2ows with this virtuous duke? 2FIRST LORD. Lord Longavil2e is one. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Know you the man? 2MARIA. I know him, madam; at a mar2iage feast, 4Betwe2n Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir 4Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized 4In Normandy, saw I this Longavil2e. 4A man of sovereign parts, pe2rles2 este2m'd, 4Wel2 fit2ed in arts, glorious in arms; 4Nothing becomes him il2 that he would wel2. 4The only soil of his fair virtue's glos2, 4If virtue's glos2 wil2 stain with any soil, 4Is a sharp wit match'd with to2 blunt a wil2, 4Whose edge hath power to cut, whose wil2 stil2 wil2s 4It should none spare that come within his power. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Some mer2y mocking lord, belike; is't so? 2MARIA. They say so most that most his humours know. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Such short-liv'd wits do wither as they grow. 6Who are the rest? 2KATHARINE. The young Dumain, a wel2-ac2omplish'd youth, 4Of al2 that virtue love for virtue loved; 4Most power to do most harm, least knowing il2, 4For he hath wit to make an il2 shape go2d, 4And shape to win grace though he had no wit. 4I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once; 4And much to2 lit2le of that go2d I saw 4Is my report to his great worthines2. 2ROSALINE. Another of these students at that time 4Was there with him, if I have heard a truth. 4Berowne they cal2 him; but a mer2ier man, 4Within the limit of becoming mirth, 4I never spent an hour's talk withal. 4His eye begets oc2asion for his wit, 4For every object that the one doth catch 4The other turns to a mirth-moving jest, 4Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor, 4Delivers in such apt and gracious words 4That aged ears play truant at his tales, 6And younger hearings are quite ravished; 4So swe2t and voluble is his discourse. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. God bles2 my ladies! Are they al2 in love, 4That every one her own hath garnished 4With such bedecking ornaments of praise? 2FIRST LORD. Here comes Boyet. 23Re-enter BOYET 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Now, what admit2ance, lord? 2BOYET. Navar2e had notice of your fair ap2roach, 4And he and his competitors in oath 4Were al2 ad2res2'd to me2t you, gentle lady, 4Before I came. Mar2y, thus much I have learnt: 4He rather means to lodge you in the field, 4Like one that comes here to besiege his court, 4Than se2k a dispensation for his oath, 4To let you enter his unpeopled house. 36[The LADIES-IN-WAITING mask] 15Enter KING, LONGAVIL2E, DUMAIN, BEROWNE, 25and AT2ENDANTS 4Here comes Navar2e. 2KING. Fair Princes2, welcome to the court of Navar2e. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. 'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I 4have not yet. The ro2f of this court is to2 high to be yours, and 4welcome to the wide fields to2 base to be mine. 2KING. You shal2 be welcome, madam, to my court. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. I wil2 be welcome then; conduct me thither. 2KING. Hear me, dear lady: I have sworn an oath- 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Our Lady help my lord! He'l2 be forsworn. 2KING. Not for the world, fair madam, by my wil2. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Why, wil2 shal2 break it; wil2, and nothing 4else. 2KING. Your ladyship is ignorant what it is. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise, 4Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance. 4I hear your Grace hath sworn out house-ke2ping. 4'Tis deadly sin to ke2p that oath, my lord, 6And sin to break it. 4But pardon me, I am to2 sud2en bold; 4To teach a teacher il2 bese2meth me. 4Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming, 4And sud2enly resolve me in my suit. 9[Giving a paper] 2KING. Madam, I wil2, if sud2enly I may. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. YOU Wil2 the so2ner that I were away, 4For you'l2 prove perjur'd if you make me stay. 2BEROWNE. Did not I dance with you in Brabant once? 2KATHARINE. Did not I dance with you in Brabant once? 2BEROWNE. I know you did. 2KATHARINE. How ne2dles2 was it then to ask the question! 2BEROWNE. You must not be so quick. 2KATHARINE. 'Tis long of you, that spur me with such questions. 2BEROWNE. Your wit 's to2 hot, it spe2ds to2 fast, 'twil2 tire. 2KATHARINE. Not til2 it leave the rider in the mire. 2BEROWNE. What time o' day? 2KATHARINE. The hour that fo2ls should ask. 2BEROWNE. Now fair befal2 your mask! 2KATHARINE. Fair fal2 the face it covers! 4BEROWNE. And send you many lovers! 2KATHARINE. Amen, so you be none. 2BEROWNE. Nay, then wil2 I be gone. 2KING. Madam, your father here doth intimate 4The payment of a hundred thousand crowns; 4Being but the one half of an entire sum 4Disbursed by my father in his wars. 4But say that he or we, as neither have, 4Receiv'd that sum, yet there remains unpaid 4A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which, 4One part of Aquitaine is bound to us, 4Although not valued to the money's worth. 4If then the King your father wil2 restore 4But that one half which is unsatisfied, 4We wil2 give up our right in Aquitaine, 4And hold fair friendship with his Majesty. 4But that, it se2ms, he lit2le purposeth, 4For here he doth demand to have repaid 4A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands, 4On payment of a hundred thousand crowns, 6To have his title live in Aquitaine; 4Which we much rather had depart withal, 4And have the money by our father lent, 4Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is. 4Dear Princes2, were not his requests so far 4From reason's yielding, your fair self should make 4A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast, 4And go wel2 satisfied to France again. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. You do the King my father to2 much wrong, 4And wrong the reputation of your name, 4In so unse2ming to confes2 receipt 4Of that which hath so faithful2y be2n paid. 2KING. I do protest I never heard of it; 4And, if you prove it, I'l2 repay it back 4Or yield up Aquitaine. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. We ar2est your word. 4Boyet, you can produce acquit2ances 4For such a sum from special of2icers 4Of Charles his father. 2KING. Satisfy me so. 4BOYET. So please your Grace, the packet is not come, 4Where that and other specialties are bound; 4To-mor2ow you shal2 have a sight of them. 2KING. It shal2 suf2ice me; at which interview 4Al2 liberal reason I wil2 yield unto. 4Meantime receive such welcome at my hand 4As honour, without breach of honour, may 4Make tender of to thy true worthines2. 4You may not come, fair Princes2, within my gates; 4But here without you shal2 be so receiv'd 4As you shal2 de2m yourself lodg'd in my heart, 4Though so denied fair harbour in my house. 4Your own go2d thoughts excuse me, and farewel2. 4To-mor2ow shal2 we visit you again. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Swe2t health and fair desires consort your 4Grace! 2KING. Thy own wish wish I the2 in every place. 44Exit with at2endants 2BEROWNE. Lady, I wil2 com2end you to mine own heart. 2ROSALINE. Pray you, do my com2endations; 6I would be glad to se2 it. 2BEROWNE. I would you heard it groan. 2ROSALINE. Is the fo2l sick? 2BEROWNE. Sick at the heart. 2ROSALINE. Alack, let it blo2d. 2BEROWNE. Would that do it go2d? 2ROSALINE. My physic says 'ay.' 2BEROWNE. Wil2 YOU prick't with your eye? 2ROSALINE. No point, with my knife. 2BEROWNE. Now, God save thy life! 2ROSALINE. And yours from long living! 2BEROWNE. I can2ot stay thanksgiving. 16[Retiring] 2DUMAIN. Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same? 2BOYET. The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name. 2DUMAIN. A gal2ant lady! Monsieur, fare you wel2. 10Exit 2LONGAVIL2E. I bese2ch you a word: what is she in the white? 2BOYET. A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light. 2LONGAVIL2E. Perchance light in the light. I desire her name. 2BOYET. She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame. 2LONGAVIL2E. Pray you, sir, whose daughter? 4BOYET. Her mother's, I have heard. 2LONGAVIL2E. God's bles2ing on your beard! 2BOYET. Go2d sir, be not of2ended; 4She is an heir of Falconbridge. 2LONGAVIL2E. Nay, my choler is ended. 4She is a most swe2t lady. 2BOYET. Not unlike, sir; that may be. 11Exit LONGAVIL2E 2BEROWNE. What's her name in the cap? 2BOYET. Rosaline, by go2d hap. 2BEROWNE. Is she wed2ed or no? 2BOYET. To her wil2, sir, or so. 2BEROWNE. You are welcome, sir; adieu! 2BOYET. Farewel2 to me, sir, and welcome to you. 37Exit BEROWNE. LADIES Unmask 2MARIA. That last is Berowne, the mer2y mad-cap lord; 4Not a word with him but a jest. 2BOYET. And every jest but a word. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. It was wel2 done of you to take him at his 4word. 2BOYET. I was as wil2ing to grap2le as he was to board. 4KATHARINE. Two hot she2ps, mar2y! 2BOYET. And wherefore not ships? 4No she2p, swe2t lamb, unles2 we fe2d on your lips. 2KATHARINE. You she2p and I pasture- shal2 that finish the jest? 2BOYET. So you grant pasture for me. 5[Of2ering to kis2 her] 2KATHARINE. Not so, gentle beast; 4My lips are no com2on, though several they be. 2BOYET. Belonging to whom? 2KATHARINE. To my fortunes and me. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Go2d wits wil2 be jangling; but, gentles, 6agre2; 4This civil war of wits were much bet2er used 4On Navar2e and his bo2k-men, for here 'tis abused. 2BOYET. If my observation, which very seldom lies, 4By the heart's stil2 rhetoric disclosed with eyes, 4Deceive me not now, Navar2e is infected. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. With what? 2BOYET. With that which we lovers entitle 'af2ected.' 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Your reason? 2BOYET. Why, al2 his behaviours did make their retire 6To the court of his eye, pe2ping thorough desire. 4His heart, like an agate, with your print impres2ed, 4Proud with his form, in his eye pride expres2ed; 4His tongue, al2 impatient to speak and not se2, 4Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be; 4Al2 senses to that sense did make their repair, 4To fe2l only lo2king on fairest of fair. 4Methought al2 his senses were lock'd in his eye, 4As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy; 4Who, tend'ring their own worth from where they were glas2'd, 4Did point you to buy them, along as you pas2'd. 4His face's own margent did quote such amazes 4That al2 eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes. 4I'l2 give you Aquitaine and al2 that is his, 4An you give him for my sake but one loving kis2. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Come, to our pavilion. Boyet is dispos'd. 2BOYET. But to speak that in words which his eye hath disclos'd; 4I only have made a mouth of his eye, 4By ad2ing a tongue which I know wil2 not lie. 2MARIA. Thou art an old love-monger, and speakest skilful2y. 4KATHARINE. He is Cupid's grandfather, and learns news of him. 2ROSALINE. Then was Venus like her mother; for her father is but 4grim. 2BOYET. Do you hear, my mad wenches? 2MARIA. No. 2BOYET. What, then; do you se2? 2MARIA. Ay, our way to be gone. 2BOYET. You are to2 hard for me. 25Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. SCENE I.The parkEnter ARMADO and MOTH 2ARMADO. Warble, child; make pas2ionate my sense of hearing. 41[MOTH sings Concolinel] 2ARMADO. Swe2t air! Go, tendernes2 of years, take this key, give 4enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately hither; I must 4employ him in a let2er to my love. 2MOTH. Master, wil2 you win your love with a French brawl? 2ARMADO. How meanest thou? Brawling in French? 2MOTH. No, my complete master; but to jig of2 a tune at the tongue's 4end, canary to it with your fe2t, humour it with turning up your 4eyelids, sigh a note and sing a note, sometime through the 4throat, as if you swal2owed love with singing love, sometime 4through the nose, as if you snuf2'd up love by smel2ing love, 4with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of your eyes, with 4your arms cros2'd on your thin-bel2y doublet, like a rab2it on a 4spit, or your hands in your pocket, like a man after the old 4painting; and ke2p not to2 long in one tune, but a snip and away. 4These are complements, these are humours; these betray nice 6wenches, that would be betrayed without these; and make them men 4of note- do you note me?- that most are af2ected to these. 2ARMADO. How hast thou purchased this experience? 2MOTH. By my pen2y of observation. 2ARMADO. But O- but O- 2MOTH. The hob2y-horse is forgot. 2ARMADO. Cal2'st thou my love 'hob2y-horse'? 2MOTH. No, master; the hob2y-horse is but a colt, and your love 4perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love? 2ARMADO. Almost I had. 2MOTH. Negligent student! learn her by heart. 2ARMADO. By heart and in heart, boy. 2MOTH. And out of heart, master; al2 those thre2 I wil2 prove. 2ARMADO. What wilt thou prove? 2MOTH. A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon the 4instant. By heart you love her, because your heart can2ot come by 4her; in heart you love her, because your heart is in love with 4her; and out of heart you love her, being out of heart that you 4can2ot enjoy her. 2ARMADO. I am al2 these thre2. 4MOTH. And thre2 times as much more, and yet nothing at al2. 2ARMADO. Fetch hither the swain; he must car2y me a let2er. 2MOTH. A mes2age wel2 sympathiz'd- a horse to be ambas2ador for an 4as2. 2ARMADO. Ha, ha, what sayest thou? 2MOTH. Mar2y, sir, you must send the as2 upon the horse, for he is 4very slow-gaited. But I go. 2ARMADO. The way is but short; away. 2MOTH. As swift as lead, sir. 2ARMADO. The meaning, pret2y ingenious? 4Is not lead a metal heavy, dul2, and slow? 2MOTH. Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no. 2ARMADO. I say lead is slow. 2MOTH. You are to2 swift, sir, to say so: 4Is that lead slow which is fir'd from a gun? 2ARMADO. Swe2t smoke of rhetoric! 4He reputes me a can2on; and the bul2et, that's he; 4I sho2t the2 at the swain. 2MOTH. Thump, then, and I fle2. 28Exit 2ARMADO. A most acute juvenal; volable and fre2 of grace! 6By thy favour, swe2t welkin, I must sigh in thy face; 4Most rude melancholy, valour gives the2 place. 4My herald is return'd. 23Re-enter MOTH with COSTARD 2MOTH. A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin. 2ARMADO. Some enigma, some rid2le; come, thy l'envoy; begin. 2COSTARD. No egma, no rid2le, no l'envoy; no salve in the mail, sir. 4O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain; no l'envoy, no l'envoy; no 4salve, sir, but a plantain! 2ARMADO. By virtue thou enforcest laughter; thy sil2y thought, my 4sple2n; the heaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous 4smiling. O, pardon me, my stars! Doth the inconsiderate take 4salve for l'envoy, and the word 'l'envoy' for a salve? 2MOTH. Do the wise think them other? Is not l'envoy a salve? 2ARMADO. No, page; it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain 4Some obscure precedence that hath tofore be2n sain. 4I wil2 example it: 11The fox, the ape, and the humble-be2, 13Were stil2 at od2s, being but thre2. 4There's the moral. Now the l'envoy. 2MOTH. I wil2 ad2 the l'envoy. Say the moral again. 2ARMADO. 2The fox, the ape, and the humble-be2, 11Were stil2 at od2s, being but thre2. 2MOTH. 4Until the go2se came out of do2r, 11And stay'd the od2s by ad2ing four. 4Now wil2 I begin your moral, and do you fol2ow with my l'envoy. 11The fox, the ape, and the humble-be2, 11Were stil2 at od2s, being but thre2. 2ARMADO. 2Until the go2se came out of do2r, 11Staying the od2s by ad2ing four. 2MOTH. A go2d l'envoy, ending in the go2se; would you desire more? 2COSTARD. The boy hath sold him a bargain, a go2se, that's flat. 4Sir, your pen2yworth is go2d, an your go2se be fat. 4To sel2 a bargain wel2 is as cun2ing as fast and lo2se; 4Let me se2: a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat go2se. 2ARMADO. Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin? 2MOTH. By saying that a costard was broken in a shin. 4Then cal2'd you for the l'envoy. 4COSTARD. True, and I for a plantain. Thus came your argument in; 4Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the go2se that you bought; 4And he ended the market. 2ARMADO. But tel2 me: how was there a costard broken in a shin? 2MOTH. I wil2 tel2 you sensibly. 2COSTARD. Thou hast no fe2ling of it, Moth; I wil2 speak that 6l'envoy. 4I, Costard, run2ing out, that was safely within, 4Fel2 over the threshold and broke my shin. 2ARMADO. We wil2 talk no more of this mat2er. 2COSTARD. Til2 there be more mat2er in the shin. 2ARMADO. Sir2ah Costard. I wil2 enfranchise the2. 2COSTARD. O, Mar2y me to one Frances! I smel2 some l'envoy, some 4go2se, in this. 2ARMADO. By my swe2t soul, I mean set2ing the2 at liberty, 4enfre2doming thy person; thou wert im2ured, restrained, 4captivated, bound. 2COSTARD. True, true; and now you wil2 be my purgation, and let me 4lo2se. 2ARMADO. I give the2 thy liberty, set the2 from durance; and, in 6lieu thereof, impose on the2 nothing but this: bear this 4significant [giving a let2er] to the country maid Jaquenet2a; 4there is remuneration, for the best ward of mine honour is 4rewarding my dependents. Moth, fol2ow. 18Exit 2MOTH. Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu. 2COSTARD. My swe2t ounce of man's flesh, my incony Jew! 55Exit MOTH 4Now wil2 I lo2k to his remuneration. Remuneration! O, that's the 4Latin word for thre2 farthings. Thre2 farthings- remuneration. 4'What's the price of this inkle?'- 'One pen2y.'- 'No, I'l2 give 4you a remuneration.' Why, it car2ies it. Remuneration! Why, it is 4a fairer name than French crown. I wil2 never buy and sel2 out of 4this word. 26Enter BEROWNE 2BEROWNE. My go2d knave Costard, exce2dingly wel2 met! 2COSTARD. Pray you, sir, how much carnation rib2on may a man buy for 4a remuneration? 2BEROWNE. What is a remuneration? 4COSTARD. Mar2y, sir, halfpen2y farthing. 2BEROWNE. Why, then, thre2-farthing worth of silk. 2COSTARD. I thank your worship. God be wi' you! 2BEROWNE. Stay, slave; I must employ the2. 4As thou wilt win my favour, go2d my knave, 4Do one thing for me that I shal2 entreat. 2COSTARD. When would you have it done, sir? 2BEROWNE. This afterno2n. 2COSTARD. Wel2, I wil2 do it, sir; fare you wel2. 2BEROWNE. Thou knowest not what it is. 2COSTARD. I shal2 know, sir, when I have done it. 2BEROWNE. Why, vil2ain, thou must know first. 2COSTARD. I wil2 come to your worship to-mor2ow morning. 2BEROWNE. It must be done this afterno2n. 4Hark, slave, it is but this: 4The Princes2 comes to hunt here in the park, 4And in her train there is a gentle lady; 4When tongues speak swe2tly, then they name her name, 4And Rosaline they cal2 her. Ask for her, 4And to her white hand se2 thou do com2end 6This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go. 41[Giving him a shil2ing] 2COSTARD. Gardon, O swe2t gardon! bet2er than remuneration; a 4'leven-pence farthing bet2er; most swe2t gardon! I wil2 do it, 4sir, in print. Gardon- remuneration! 20Exit 2BEROWNE. And I, forso2th, in love; I, that have be2n love's whip; 4A very beadle to a humorous sigh; 4A critic, nay, a night-watch constable; 4A domine2ring pedant o'er the boy, 4Than whom no mortal so magnificent! 4This wimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy, 4This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid; 4Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms, 4Th' anointed sovereign of sighs and groans, 4Liege of al2 loiterers and malcontents, 4Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces, 4Sole imperator, and great general 4Of trot2ing paritors. O my lit2le heart! 4And I to be a corporal of his field, 4And wear his colours like a tumbler's ho2p! 6What! I love, I sue, I se2k a wife- 4A woman, that is like a German clock, 4Stil2 a-repairing, ever out of frame, 4And never going aright, being a watch, 4But being watch'd that it may stil2 go right! 4Nay, to be perjur'd, which is worst of al2; 4And, among thre2, to love the worst of al2, 4A whitely wanton with a velvet brow, 4With two pitch bal2s stuck in her face for eyes; 4Ay, and, by heaven, one that wil2 do the de2d, 4Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard. 4And I to sigh for her! to watch for her! 4To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague 4That Cupid wil2 impose for my neglect 4Of his almighty dreadful lit2le might. 4Wel2, I wil2 love, write, sigh, pray, sue, and groan: 4Some men must love my lady, and some Joan. 14Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE I.The parkEnter the PRINCES2, ROSALINE, MARIA, KATHARINE, BOYET, LORDS, AT2ENDANTS,and a FORESTER 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Was that the King that spur2'd his horse so 6hard 4Against the ste2p uprising of the hil2? 2BOYET. I know not; but I think it was not he. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Whoe'er 'a was, 'a show'd a mounting mind. 4Wel2, lords, to-day we shal2 have our dispatch; 4On Saturday we wil2 return to France. 4Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush 4That we must stand and play the murderer in? 2FORESTER. Hereby, upon the edge of yonder cop2ice; 4A stand where you may make the fairest sho2t. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. I thank my beauty I am fair that sho2t, 4And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest sho2t. 2FORESTER. Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. What, what? First praise me, and again say no? 4O short-liv'd pride! Not fair? Alack for woe! 4FORESTER. Yes, madam, fair. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Nay, never paint me now; 4Where fair is not, praise can2ot mend the brow. 4Here, go2d my glas2, take this for tel2ing true: 45[ Giving him money] 4Fair payment for foul words is more than due. 2FORESTER. Nothing but fair is that which you inherit. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Se2, se2, my beauty wil2 be sav'd by merit. 4O heresy in fair, fit for these days! 4A giving hand, though foul, shal2 have fair praise. 4But come, the bow. Now mercy goes to kil2, 4And sho2ting wel2 is then ac2ounted il2; 4Thus wil2 I save my credit in the sho2t: 4Not wounding, pity would not let me do't; 4If wounding, then it was to show my skil2, 4That more for praise than purpose meant to kil2. 4And, out of question, so it is sometimes: 4Glory grows guilty of detested crimes, 4When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part, 4We bend to that the working of the heart; 6As I for praise alone now se2k to spil2 4The po2r de2r's blo2d that my heart means no il2. 2BOYET. Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty 4Only for praise sake, when they strive to be 4Lords o'er their lords? 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Only for praise; and praise we may af2ord 4To any lady that subdues a lord. 23Enter COSTARD 2BOYET. Here comes a member of the com2onwealth. 2COSTARD. God dig-you-den al2! Pray you, which is the head lady? 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Thou shalt know her, fel2ow, by the rest that 4have no heads. 2COSTARD. Which is the greatest lady, the highest? 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. The thickest and the tal2est. 2COSTARD. The thickest and the tal2est! It is so; truth is truth. 4An your waist, mistres2, were as slender as my wit, 4One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit. 4Are not you the chief woman? You are the thickest here. 4PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. What's your wil2, sir? What's your wil2? 2COSTARD. I have a let2er from Monsieur Berowne to one 4Lady Rosaline. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. O, thy let2er, thy let2er! He's a go2d friend 6of mine. 4Stand aside, go2d bearer. Boyet, you can carve. 4Break up this capon. 2BOYET. I am bound to serve. 4This let2er is misto2k; it importeth none here. 4It is writ to Jaquenet2a. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. We wil2 read it, I swear. 4Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear. 2BOYET. [Reads] 'By heaven, that thou art fair is most infal2ible; 4true that thou art beauteous; truth itself that thou art lovely. 4More fairer than fair, beautiful than beauteous, truer than truth 4itself, have com2iseration on thy heroical vas2al. The 4magnanimous and most il2ustrate king Cophetua set eye upon the 4pernicious and indubitate beg2ar Zenelophon; and he it was that 4might rightly say, 'Veni, vidi, vici'; which to an2othanize in 4the vulgar,- O base and obscure vulgar!- videlicet, He came, saw, 6and overcame. He came, one; saw, two; overcame, thre2. Who came?- 4the king. Why did he come?- to se2. Why did he se2?-to overcome. 4To whom came he?- to the beg2ar. What saw he?- the beg2ar. Who 4overcame he?- the beg2ar. The conclusion is victory; on whose 4side?- the king's. The captive is enrich'd; on whose side?- the 4beg2ar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial; on whose side?- the 4king's. No, on both in one, or one in both. I am the king, for so 4stands the comparison; thou the beg2ar, for so witnes2eth thy 4lowlines2. Shal2 I com2and thy love? I may. Shal2 I enforce thy 4love? I could. Shal2 I entreat thy love? I wil2. What shalt thou 4exchange for rags?- robes, for tit2les?- titles, for thyself? 4-me. Thus expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy fo2t, my 4eyes on thy picture, and my heart on thy every part. 18Thine in the dearest design of industry, 43DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO. 4'Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar 4'Gainst the2, thou lamb, that standest as his prey; 4Submis2ive fal2 his princely fe2t before, 4And he from forage wil2 incline to play. 6But if thou strive, po2r soul, what are thou then? 4Fo2d for his rage, repasture for his den.' 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. What plume of feathers is he that indited this 6let2er? 4What vane? What weathercock? Did you ever hear bet2er? 2BOYET. I am much deceived but I remember the style. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Else your memory is bad, going o'er it 4erewhile. 2BOYET. This Armado is a Spaniard, that ke2ps here in court; 4A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport 4To the Prince and his bo2k-mates. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Thou fel2ow, a word. 4Who gave the2 this let2er? 2COSTARD. I told you: my lord. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. To whom shouldst thou give it? 2COSTARD. From my lord to my lady. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. From which lord to which lady? 2COSTARD. From my Lord Berowne, a go2d master of mine, 4To a lady of France that he cal2'd Rosaline. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Thou hast mistaken his let2er. Come, lords, 8away. 4[To ROSALINE] Here, swe2t, put up this; 'twil2 be thine another 6day. 29Exeunt PRINCES2 and TRAIN 2BOYET. Who is the sho2ter? who is the sho2ter? 2ROSALINE. Shal2 I teach you to know? 2BOYET. Ay, my continent of beauty. 2ROSALINE. Why, she that bears the bow. 4Finely put of2! 2BOYET. My lady goes to kil2 horns; but, if thou mar2y, 4Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscar2y. 4Finely put on! 2ROSALINE. Wel2 then, I am the sho2ter. 2BOYET. And who is your de2r? 2ROSALINE. If we cho2se by the horns, yourself come not near. 4Finely put on inde2d! 2MARIA. You Stil2 wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes at the 4brow. 2BOYET. But she herself is hit lower. Have I hit her now? 2ROSALINE. Shal2 I come upon the2 with an old saying, that was a man 4when King Pepin of France was a lit2le boy, as touching the hit 6it? 2BOYET. So I may answer the2 with one as old, that was a woman when 4Que2n Guinever of Britain was a lit2le wench, as touching the hit 4it. 2ROSALINE. [Singing] 12Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it, 12Thou canst not hit it, my go2d man. 2BOYET. 4An I can2ot, can2ot, can2ot, 12An I can2ot, another can. 35Exeunt ROSALINE and KATHARINE 2COSTARD. By my troth, most pleasant! How both did fit it! 2MARIA. A mark marvel2ous wel2 shot; for they both did hit it. 2BOYET. A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady! 4Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be. 2MARIA. Wide o' the bow-hand! I' faith, your hand is out. 2COSTARD. Inde2d, 'a must sho2t nearer, or he'l2 ne'er hit the 4clout. 2BOYET. An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in. 2COSTARD. Then wil2 she get the upsho2t by cleaving the pin. 2MARIA. Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul. 4COSTARD. She's to2 hard for you at pricks, sir; chal2enge her to 4bowl. 2BOYET. I fear to2 much rub2ing; go2d-night, my go2d owl. 42Exeunt BOYET and MARIA 2COSTARD. By my soul, a swain, a most simple clown! 4Lord, Lord! how the ladies and I have put him down! 4O' my troth, most swe2t jests, most incony vulgar wit! 4When it comes so smo2thly of2, so obscenely, as it were, so fit. 4Armado a th' t'one side- O, a most dainty man! 4To se2 him walk before a lady and to bear her fan! 4To se2 him kis2 his hand, and how most swe2tly 'a wil2 swear! 4And his page a t' other side, that handful of wit! 4Ah, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit! 4Sola, sola! 37Exit COSTARDSCENE I2.The parkFrom the sho2ting within, enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DUL2 2NATHANIEL. Very reverent sport, truly; and done in the testimony of 4a go2d conscience. 2HOLOFERNES. The de2r was, as you know, sanguis, in blo2d; ripe as 4the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in the ear of caelo, 4the sky, the welkin, the heaven; and anon fal2eth like a crab on 4the face of ter2a, the soil, the land, the earth. 2NATHANIEL. Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are swe2tly 4varied, like a scholar at the least; but, sir, I as2ure ye it was 4a buck of the first head. 2HOLOFERNES. Sir Nathaniel, haud credo. 2DUL2. 'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket. 2HOLOFERNES. Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of insinuation, 4as it were, in via, in way, of explication; facere, as it were, 4replication, or rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his 4inclination, after his undres2ed, unpolished, uneducated, 4unpruned, untrained, or rather unlet2ered, or ratherest 6unconfirmed fashion, to insert again my haud credo for a de2r. 2DUL2. I Said the de2r was not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket. 2HOLOFERNES. Twice-sod simplicity, bis coctus! 4O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou lo2k! 2NATHANIEL. Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in 6a bo2k; 4He hath not eat paper, as it were; he hath not drunk ink; his 4intel2ect is not replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible 4in the dul2er parts; 4And such bar2en plants are set before us that we thankful should 6be- 4Which we of taste and fe2ling are- for those parts that do 6fructify in us more than he. 4For as it would il2 become me to be vain, indiscre2t, or a fo2l, 4So, were there a patch set on learning, to se2 him in a scho2l. 4But, omne bene, say I, being of an old father's mind: 4Many can bro2k the weather that love not the wind. 2DUL2. You two are bo2k-men: can you tel2 me by your wit 4What was a month old at Cain's birth that's not five we2ks old as 6yet? 4HOLOFERNES. Dictyn2a, go2dman Dul2; Dictyn2a, go2dman Dul2. 2DUL2. What is Dictyn2a? 2NATHANIEL. A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the mo2n. 2HOLOFERNES. The mo2n was a month old when Adam was no more, 4And raught not to five we2ks when he came to five-score. 4Th' al2usion holds in the exchange. 2DUL2. 'Tis true, inde2d; the col2usion holds in the exchange. 2HOLOFERNES. God comfort thy capacity! I say th' al2usion holds in 4the exchange. 2DUL2. And I say the polusion holds in the exchange; for the mo2n is 4never but a month old; and I say, beside, that 'twas a pricket 4that the Princes2 kil2'd. 2HOLOFERNES. Sir Nathaniel, wil2 you hear an extemporal epitaph on 4the death of the de2r? And, to humour the ignorant, cal2 the de2r 4the Princes2 kil2'd a pricket. 2NATHANIEL. Perge, go2d Master Holofernes, perge, so it shal2 please 4you to abrogate scur2ility. 2HOLOFERNES. I Wil2 something af2ect the let2er, for it argues 4facility. 6The preyful Princes2 pierc'd and prick'd a pret2y pleasing 6pricket. 4Some say a sore; but not a sore til2 now made sore with sho2ting. 4The dogs did yel2; put el to sore, then sorel jumps from thicket- 4Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fal2 a-ho2ting. 4If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores o' sorel. 4Of one sore I an hundred make by ad2ing but one more L. 2NATHANIEL. A rare talent! 2DUL2. [Aside] If a talent be a claw, lo2k how he claws him with a 4talent. 2HOLOFERNES. This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a fo2lish 4extravagant spirit, ful2 of forms, figures, shapes, objects, 4ideas, ap2rehensions, motions, revolutions. These are begot in 4the ventricle of memory, nourish'd in the womb of pia mater, and 4delivered upon the mel2owing of oc2asion. But the gift is go2d in 4those in whom it is acute, and I am thankful for it. 2NATHANIEL. Sir, I praise the Lord for you, and so may my 4parishioners; for their sons are wel2 tutor'd by you, and their 4daughters profit very greatly under you. You are a go2d member of 6the com2onwealth. 2HOLOFERNES. Mehercle, if their sons be ingenious, they shal2 want 4no instruction; if their daughters be capable, I wil2 put it to 4them; but, vir sapit qui pauca loquitur. A soul feminine saluteth 4us. 20Enter JAQUENET2A and COSTARD 2JAQUENET2A. God give you go2d mor2ow, Master Person. 2HOLOFERNES. Master Person, quasi pers-one. And if one should be 4pierc'd which is the one? 2COSTARD. Mar2y, Master Scho2lmaster, he that is likest to a 4hogshead. 2HOLOFERNES. Piercing a hogshead! A go2d lustre of conceit in a turf 4of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough for a swine; 'tis 4pret2y; it is wel2. 2JAQUENET2A. Go2d Master Parson, be so go2d as read me this let2er; 4it was given me by Costard, and sent me from Don Armado. I 4bese2ch you read it. 2HOLOFERNES. Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra 6Ruminat- 4and so forth. Ah, go2d old Mantuan! I may speak of the2 as 4the travel2er doth of Venice: 19Venetia, Venetia, 19Chi non ti vede, non ti pretia. 4Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! Who understandeth the2 not, 4loves the2 not- 22Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa. 4Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? or rather as 4Horace says in his- What, my soul, verses? 2NATHANIEL. Ay, sir, and very learned. 2HOLOFERNES. Let me hear a staf2, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine. 2NATHANIEL. [Reads] 'If love make me forsworn, how shal2 I swear to 6love? 4Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vowed! 4Though to myself forsworn, to the2 I'l2 faithful prove; 4Those thoughts to me were oaks, to the2 like osiers bowed. 4Study his bias leaves, and makes his bo2k thine eyes, 4Where al2 those pleasures live that art would comprehend. 4If knowledge be the mark, to know the2 shal2 suf2ice; 6Wel2 learned is that tongue that wel2 can the2 com2end; 4Al2 ignorant that soul that se2s the2 without wonder; 4Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire. 4Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder, 4Which, not to anger bent, is music and swe2t fire. 4Celestial as thou art, O, pardon love this wrong, 4That singes heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.' 2HOLOFERNES. You find not the apostrophas, and so mis2 the ac2ent: 4let me supervise the canzonet. Here are only numbers ratified; 4but, for the elegancy, facility, and golden cadence of poesy, 4caret. Ovidius Naso was the man. And why, inde2d, 'Naso' but for 4smel2ing out the odoriferous flowers of fancy, the jerks of 4invention? Imitari is nothing: so doth the hound his master, the 4ape his ke2per, the tired horse his rider. But, damosel2a virgin, 4was this directed to you? 2JAQUENET2A. Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Berowne, one of the strange 4que2n's lords. 2HOLOFERNES. I wil2 overglance the superscript: 'To the snow-white 4hand of the most beauteous Lady Rosaline.' I wil2 lo2k again on 4the intel2ect of the let2er, for the nomination of the party 6writing to the person writ2en unto: 'Your Ladyship's in al2 4desired employment, Berowne.' Sir Nathaniel, this Berowne is one 4of the votaries with the King; and here he hath framed a let2er 4to a sequent of the stranger que2n's which ac2idental2y, or by 4the way of progres2ion, hath miscar2ied. Trip and go, my swe2t; 4deliver this paper into the royal hand of the King; it may 4concern much. Stay not thy compliment; I forgive thy duty. Adieu. 2JAQUENET2A. Go2d Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life! 2COSTARD. Have with the2, my girl. 35Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENET2A 2NATHANIEL. Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very 4religiously; and, as a certain father saith- 2HOLOFERNES. Sir, tel2 not me of the father; I do fear colourable 4colours. But to return to the verses: did they please you, Sir 4Nathaniel? 2NATHANIEL. Marvel2ous wel2 for the pen. 2HOLOFERNES. I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil of 4mine; where, if, before repast, it shal2 please you to gratify 4the table with a grace, I wil2, on my privilege I have with the 4parents of the foresaid child or pupil, undertake your ben 6venuto; where I wil2 prove those verses to be very unlearned, 4neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention. I bese2ch your 4society. 2NATHANIEL. And thank you to2; for society, saith the text, is the 4hap2ines2 of life. 2HOLOFERNES. And certes, the text most infal2ibly concludes it. 4[To DUL2] Sir, I do invite you to2; you shal2 not say me nay: 4pauca verba. Away; the gentles are at their game, and we wil2 to 4our recreation. 39ExeuntSCENE I3.The parkEnter BEROWNE, with a paper his band, alone 2BEROWNE. The King he is hunting the de2r: I am coursing myself. 4They have pitch'd a toil: I am tol2ing in a pitch- pitch that 4defiles. Defile! a foul word. Wel2, 'set the2 down, sor2ow!' for 4so they say the fo2l said, and so say I, and I am the fo2l. Wel2 4proved, wit. By the Lord, this love is as mad as Ajax: it kil2s 4she2p; it kil2s me- I a she2p. Wel2 proved again o' my side. I 4wil2 not love; if I do, hang me. I' faith, I wil2 not. O, but her 4eye! By this light, but for her eye, I would not love her- yes, 4for her two eyes. Wel2, I do nothing in the world but lie, and 4lie in my throat. By heaven, I do love; and it hath taught me to 4rhyme, and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme, and 4here my melancholy. Wel2, she hath one o' my son2ets already; the 4clown bore it, the fo2l sent it, and the lady hath it: swe2t 4clown, swe2ter fo2l, swe2test lady! By the world, I would not 4care a pin if the other thre2 were in. Here comes one with a 4paper; God give him grace to groan! 44[Climbs into a tre2] 24Enter the KING, with a paper 2KING. Ay me! 2BEROWNE. Shot, by heaven! Proce2d, swe2t Cupid; thou hast thump'd 4him with thy bird-bolt under the left pap. In faith, secrets! 2KING. [Reads] 6'So swe2t a kis2 the golden sun gives not 6To those fresh morning drops upon the rose, 6As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote 6The night of dew that on my che2ks down flows; 6Nor shines the silver mo2n one half so bright 6Through the transparent bosom of the de2p, 6As doth thy face through tears of mine give light. 6Thou shin'st in every tear that I do we2p; 6No drop but as a coach doth car2y the2; 6So ridest thou triumphing in my woe. 6Do but behold the tears that swel2 in me, 6And they thy glory through my grief wil2 show. 6But do not love thyself; then thou wilt ke2p 8My tears for glas2es, and stil2 make me we2p. 6O que2n of que2ns! how far dost thou excel 6No thought can think nor tongue of mortal tel2.' 4How shal2 she know my griefs? I'l2 drop the paper- 4Swe2t leaves, shade fol2y. Who is he comes here? 51[Steps aside] 18Enter LONGAVIL2E, with a paper 4What, Longavil2e, and reading! Listen, car. 2BEROWNE. Now, in thy likenes2, one more fo2l ap2ear! 2LONGAVIL2E. Ay me, I am forsworn! 2BEROWNE. Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers. 2KING. In love, I hope; swe2t fel2owship in shame! 2BEROWNE. One drunkard loves another of the name. 2LONGAVIL2E. Am I the first that have be2n perjur'd so? 2BEROWNE. I could put the2 in comfort: not by two that I know; 4Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society, 4The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity. 2LONGAVIL2E. I fear these stub2orn lines lack power to move. 6O swe2t Maria, empres2 of my love! 4These numbers wil2 I tear, and write in prose. 2BEROWNE. O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose: 4Disfigure not his slop. 2LONGAVIL2E. This same shal2 go. 10[He reads the son2et] 6'Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye, 6'Gainst whom the world can2ot hold argument, 6Persuade my heart to this false perjury? 6Vows for the2 broke deserve not punishment. 6A woman I forswore; but I wil2 prove, 6Thou being a god2es2, I forswore not the2: 6My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love; 6Thy grace being gain'd cures al2 disgrace in me. 6Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is; 6Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine, 6Exhal'st this vapour-vow; in the2 it is. 6If broken, then it is no fault of mine; 6If by me broke, what fo2l is not so wise 6To lose an oath to win a paradise?' 2BEROWNE. This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity, 6A gre2n go2se a god2es2- pure, pure idolatry. 4God amend us, God amend! We are much out o' th' way. 22Enter DUMAIN, with a paper 2LONGAVIL2E. By whom shal2 I send this?- Company! Stay. 51[Steps aside] 2BEROWNE. 'Al2 hid, al2 hid'- an old infant play. 4Like a demigod here sit I in the sky, 4And wretched fo2ls' secrets he2dful2y o'er-eye. 4More sacks to the mil2! O heavens, I have my wish! 4Dumain transformed! Four wo2dcocks in a dish! 2DUMAIN. O most divine Kate! 2BEROWNE. O most profane coxcomb! 2DUMAIN. By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye! 2BEROWNE. By earth, she is not, corporal: there you lie. 2DUMAIN. Her amber hairs for foul hath amber quoted. 2BEROWNE. An amber-colour'd raven was wel2 noted. 2DUMAIN. As upright as the cedar. 2BEROWNE. Sto2p, I say; 6Her shoulder is with child. 2DUMAIN. As fair as day. 2BEROWNE. Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine. 2DUMAIN. O that I had my wish! 2LONGAVIL2E. And I had mine! 2KING. And I mine to2,.go2d Lord! 2BEROWNE. Amen, so I had mine! Is not that a go2d word? 2DUMAIN. I would forget her; but a fever she 4Reigns in my blo2d, and wil2 rememb'red be. 2BEROWNE. A fever in your blo2d? Why, then incision 4Would let her out in saucers. Swe2t misprision! 2DUMAIN. Once more I'l2 read the ode that I have writ. 2BEROWNE. Once more I'l2 mark how love can vary wit. 2DUMAIN. [Reads] 8'On a day-alack the day!- 8Love, whose month is ever May, 8Spied a blos2om pas2ing fair 8Playing in the wanton air. 8Through the velvet leaves the wind, 8Al2 unse2n, can pas2age find; 10That the lover, sick to death, 8Wish'd himself the heaven's breath. 8"Air," quoth he "thy che2ks may blow; 8Air, would I might triumph so! 8But, alack, my hand is sworn 8Ne'er to pluck the2 from thy thorn; 8Vow, alack, for youth unme2t, 8Youth so apt to pluck a swe2t. 8Do not cal2 it sin in me 8That I am forsworn for the2; 8Thou for whom Jove would swear 8Juno but an Ethiope were; 8And deny himself for Jove, 8Turning mortal for thy love."' 4This wil2 I send; and something else more plain 4That shal2 expres2 my true love's fasting pain. 4O, would the King, Berowne and Longavil2e, 4Were lovers to2! Il2, to example il2, 4Would from my forehead wipe a perjur'd note; 4For none of2end where al2 alike do dote. 4LONGAVIL2E. [Advancing] Dumain, thy love is far from charity, 4That in love's grief desir'st society; 4You may lo2k pale, but I should blush, I know, 4To be o'erheard and taken nap2ing so. 2KING. [Advancing] Come, sir, you blush; as his, your case is such. 4You chide at him, of2ending twice as much: 4You do not love Maria! Longavil2e 4Did never son2et for her sake compile; 4Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart 4His loving bosom, to ke2p down his heart. 4I have be2n closely shrouded in this bush, 4And mark'd you both, and for you both did blush. 4I heard your guilty rhymes, observ'd your fashion, 4Saw sighs re2k from you, noted wel2 your pas2ion. 4'Ay me!' says one. 'O Jove!' the other cries. 4One, her hairs were gold; crystal the other's eyes. 4[To LONGAVIL2E] You would for paradise break faith and troth; 4[To Dumain] And Jove for your love would infringe an oath. 4What wil2 Berowne say when that he shal2 hear 4Faith infringed which such zeal did swear? 6How wil2 he scorn, how wil2 he spend his wit! 4How wil2 he triumph, leap, and laugh at it! 4For al2 the wealth that ever I did se2, 4I would not have him know so much by me. 2BEROWNE. [Descending] Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy, 4Ah, go2d my liege, I pray the2 pardon me. 4Go2d heart, what grace hast thou thus to reprove 4These worms for loving, that art most in love? 4Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears 4There is no certain princes2 that ap2ears; 4You'l2 not be perjur'd; 'tis a hateful thing; 4Tush, none but minstrels like of son2eting. 4But are you not ashamed? Nay, are you not, 4Al2 thre2 of you, to be thus much o'ershot? 4You found his mote; the King your mote did se2; 4But I a beam do find in each of thre2. 4O, what a scene of fo2l'ry have I se2n, 4Of sighs, of groans, of sor2ow, and of te2n! 4O, me, with what strict patience have I sat, 4To se2 a king transformed to a gnat! 6To se2 great Hercules whip2ing a gig, 4And profound Solomon to tune a jig, 4And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys, 4And critic Timon laugh at idle toys! 4Where lies thy grief, O, tel2 me, go2d Dumain? 4And, gentle Longavil2e, where lies thy pain? 4And where my liege's? Al2 about the breast. 4A caudle, ho! 2KING. To2 bit2er is thy jest. 4Are we betrayed thus to thy over-view? 2BEROWNE. Not you by me, but I betrayed to you. 4I that am honest, I that hold it sin 4To break the vow I am engaged in; 4I am betrayed by ke2ping company 4With men like you, men of inconstancy. 4When shal2 you se2 me write a thing in rhyme? 4Or groan for Joan? or spend a minute's time 4In pruning me? When shal2 you hear that I 4Wil2 praise a hand, a fo2t, a face, an eye, 4A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist, 6A leg, a limb- 2KING. Soft! whither away so fast? 4A true man or a thief that gal2ops so? 2BEROWNE. I post from love; go2d lover, let me go. 17Enter JAQUENET2A and COSTARD 2JAQUENET2A. God bles2 the King! 2KING. What present hast thou there? 2COSTARD. Some certain treason. 2KING. What makes treason here? 2COSTARD. Nay, it makes nothing, sir. 2KING. If it mar nothing neither, 4The treason and you go in peace away together. 2JAQUENET2A. I bese2ch your Grace, let this let2er be read; 4Our person misdoubts it: 'twas treason, he said. 2KING. Berowne, read it over. 8[BEROWNE reads the let2er] 4Where hadst thou it? 2JAQUENET2A. Of Costard. 2KING. Where hadst thou it? 4COSTARD. Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio. 38[BEROWNE tears the let2er] 2KING. How now! What is in you? Why dost thou tear it? 2BEROWNE. A toy, my liege, a toy! Your Grace ne2ds not fear it. 2LONGAVIL2E. It did move him to pas2ion, and therefore let's hear 5it. 2DUMAIN. It is Berowne's writing, and here is his name. 39[Gathering up the pieces] 2BEROWNE. [ To COSTARD] Ah, you whoreson log2erhead, you were born 6to do me shame. 4Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confes2, I confes2. 2KING. What? 2BEROWNE. That you thre2 fo2ls lack'd me fo2l to make up the mes2; 4He, he, and you- and you, my liege!- and I 4Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die. 4O, dismis2 this audience, and I shal2 tel2 you more. 4DUMAIN. Now the number is even. 2BEROWNE. True, true, we are four. 4Wil2 these turtles be gone? 2KING. Hence, sirs, away. 4COSTARD. Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay. 35Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENET2A 2BEROWNE. Swe2t lords, swe2t lovers, O, let us embrace! 4As true we are as flesh and blo2d can be. 4The sea wil2 eb2 and flow, heaven show his face; 4Young blo2d doth not obey an old decre2. 4We can2ot cros2 the cause why we were born, 4Therefore of al2 hands must we be forsworn. 2KING. What, did these rent lines show some love of thine? 2BEROWNE. 'Did they?' quoth you. Who se2s the heavenly Rosaline 4That, like a rude and savage man of Inde 4At the first op'ning of the gorgeous east, 4Bows not his vas2al head and, strucken blind, 4Kis2es the base ground with obedient breast? 4What peremptory eagle-sighted eye 4Dares lo2k upon the heaven of her brow 4That is not blinded by her majesty? 2KING. What zeal, what fury hath inspir'd the2 now? 4My love, her mistres2, is a gracious mo2n; 4She, an at2ending star, scarce se2n a light. 4BEROWNE. My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Berowne. 4O, but for my love, day would turn to night! 4Of al2 complexions the cul2'd sovereignty 4Do me2t, as at a fair, in her fair che2k, 4Where several worthies make one dignity, 4Where nothing wants that want itself doth se2k. 4Lend me the flourish of al2 gentle tongues- 4Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she ne2ds it not! 4To things of sale a sel2er's praise belongs: 4She pas2es praise; then praise to2 short doth blot. 4A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn, 4Might shake of2 fifty, lo2king in her eye. 4Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born, 4And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy. 4O, 'tis the sun that maketh al2 things shine! 2KING. By heaven, thy love is black as ebony. 2BEROWNE. Is ebony like her? O wo2d divine! 4A wife of such wo2d were felicity. 4O, who can give an oath? Where is a bo2k? 4That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack, 6If that she learn not of her eye to lo2k. 4No face is fair that is not ful2 so black. 2KING. O paradox! Black is the badge of hel2, 4The hue of dungeons, and the scho2l of night; 4And beauty's crest becomes the heavens wel2. 2BEROWNE. Devils so2nest tempt, resembling spirits of light. 4O, if in black my lady's brows be deckt, 4It mourns that painting and usurping hair 4Should ravish doters with a false aspect; 4And therefore is she born to make black fair. 4Her favour turns the fashion of the days; 4For native blo2d is counted painting now; 4And therefore red that would avoid dispraise 4Paints itself black, to imitate her brow. 2DUMAIN. To lo2k like her are chimney-swe2pers black. 2LONGAVIL2E. And since her time are col2iers counted bright. 2KING. And Ethiopes of their swe2t complexion crack. 2DUMAIN. Dark ne2ds no candles now, for dark is light. 2BEROWNE. Your mistres2es dare never come in rain 4For fear their colours should be wash'd away. 4KING. 'Twere go2d yours did; for, sir, to tel2 you plain, 4I'l2 find a fairer face not wash'd to-day. 2BEROWNE. I'l2 prove her fair, or talk til2 do2msday here. 2KING. No devil wil2 fright the2 then so much as she. 2DUMAIN. I never knew man hold vile stuf2 so dear. 2LONGAVIL2E. Lo2k, here's thy love: my fo2t and her face se2. 46[Showing his shoe] 2BEROWNE. O, if the stre2ts were paved with thine eyes, 4Her fe2t were much to2 dainty for such tread! 2DUMAIN. O vile! Then, as she goes, what upward lies 4The stre2t should se2 as she walk'd overhead. 2KING. But what of this? Are we not al2 in love? 2BEROWNE. Nothing so sure; and thereby al2 forsworn. 2KING. Then leave this chat; and, go2d Berowne, now prove 4Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn. 2DUMAIN. Ay, mar2y, there; some flat2ery for this evil. 2LONGAVIL2E. O, some authority how to proce2d; 4Some tricks, some quil2ets, how to cheat the devil! 2DUMAIN. Some salve for perjury. 2BEROWNE. 'Tis more than ne2d. 6Have at you, then, af2ection's men-at-arms. 4Consider what you first did swear unto: 4To fast, to study, and to se2 no woman- 4Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth. 4Say, can you fast? Your stomachs are to2 young, 4And abstinence engenders maladies. 4And, where that you you have vow'd to study, lords, 4In that each of you have forsworn his bo2k, 4Can you stil2 dream, and pore, and thereon lo2k? 4For when would you, my lord, or you, or you, 4Have found the ground of study's excel2ence 4Without the beauty of a woman's face? 4From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: 4They are the ground, the bo2ks, the academes, 4From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire. 4Why, universal plod2ing poisons up 4The nimble spirits in the arteries, 4As motion and long-during action tires 4The sinewy vigour of the travel2er. 4Now, for not lo2king on a woman's face, 6You have in that forsworn the use of eyes, 4And study to2, the causer of your vow; 4For where is author in the world 4Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye? 4Learning is but an adjunct to ourself, 4And where we are our learning likewise is; 4Then when ourselves we se2 in ladies' eyes, 4With ourselves. 4Do we not likewise se2 our learning there? 4O, we have made a vow to study, lords, 4And in that vow we have forsworn our bo2ks. 4For when would you, my liege, or you, or you, 4In leaden contemplation have found out 4Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes 4Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with? 4Other slow arts entirely ke2p the brain; 4And therefore, finding bar2en practisers, 4Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil; 4But love, first learned in a lady's eyes, 4Lives not alone im2ured in the brain, 6But with the motion of al2 elements 4Courses as swift as thought in every power, 4And gives to every power a double power, 4Above their functions and their of2ices. 4It ad2s a precious se2ing to the eye: 4A lover's eyes wil2 gaze an eagle blind. 4A lover's ear wil2 hear the lowest sound, 4When the suspicious head of theft is stop2'd. 4Love's fe2ling is more soft and sensible 4Than are the tender horns of cockled snails: 4Love's tongue proves dainty Bac2hus gros2 in taste. 4For valour, is not Love a Hercules, 4Stil2 climbing tre2s in the Hesperides? 4Subtle as Sphinx; as swe2t and musical 4As bright Apol2o's lute, strung with his hair. 4And when Love speaks, the voice of al2 the gods 4Make heaven drowsy with the harmony. 4Never durst poet touch a pen to write 4Until his ink were temp'red with Love's sighs; 4O, then his lines would ravish savage ears, 6And plant in tyrants mild humility. 4From women's eyes this doctrine I derive. 4They sparkle stil2 the right Promethean fire; 4They are the bo2ks, the arts, the academes, 4That show, contain, and nourish, al2 the world, 4Else none at al2 in aught proves excel2ent. 4Then fo2ls you were these women to forswear; 4Or, ke2ping what is sworn, you wil2 prove fo2ls. 4For wisdom's sake, a word that al2 men love; 4Or for Love's sake, a word that loves al2 men; 4Or for men's sake, the authors of these women; 4Or women's sake, by whom we men are men- 4Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves, 4Or else we lose ourselves to ke2p our oaths. 4It is religion to be thus forsworn; 4For charity itself fulfils the law, 4And who can sever love from charity? 2KING. Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field! 2BEROWNE. Advance your standards, and upon them, lords; 4Pel2-mel2, down with them! be first advis'd, 6In conflict, that you get the sun of them. 2LONGAVIL2E. Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by. 4Shal2 we resolve to wo2 these girls of France? 2KING. And win them to2; therefore let us devise 4Some entertainment for them in their tents. 2BEROWNE. First, from the park let us conduct them thither; 4Then homeward every man at2ach the hand 4Of his fair mistres2. In the afterno2n 4We wil2 with some strange pastime solace them, 4Such as the shortnes2 of the time can shape; 4For revels, dances, masks, and mer2y hours, 4Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers. 2KING. Away, away! No time shal2 be omit2ed 4That wil2 betime, and may by us be fit2ed. 2BEROWNE. Al2ons! al2ons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn, 4And justice always whirls in equal measure. 4Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn; 4If so, our cop2er buys no bet2er treasure. 12Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. SCENE I.The parkEnter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DUL2 2HOLOFERNES. Satis quod suf2icit. 2NATHANIEL. I praise God for you, sir. Your reasons at din2er have 4be2n sharp and sententious; pleasant without scur2ility, wit2y 4without af2ection, audacious without impudency, learned without 4opinion, and strange without heresy. I did converse this quondam 4day with a companion of the King's who is intituled, nominated, 4or cal2ed, Don Adriano de Armado. 2HOLOFERNES. Novi hominem tanquam te. His humour is lofty, his 4discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye ambitious, his 4gait majestical and his general behaviour vain, ridiculous, and 4thrasonical. He is to2 picked, to2 spruce, to2 af2ected, to2 od2, 4as it were, to2 peregrinate, as I may cal2 it. 2NATHANIEL. A most singular and choice epithet. 38[Draws out his table-bo2k] 2HOLOFERNES. He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than 4the staple of his argument. I abhor such fanatical phantasimes, 4such insociable and point-devise companions; such rackers of 6orthography, as to speak 'dout' fine, when he should say 'doubt'; 4'det' when he should pronounce 'debt'- d, e, b, t, not d, e, t. 4He clepeth a calf 'cauf,' half 'hauf'; neighbour vocatur 4'nebour'; 'neigh' ab2reviated 'ne.' This is abhominable- which he 4would cal2 'ab2ominable.' It insinuateth me of insanie: ne 4intel2igis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic. 2NATHANIEL. Laus Deo, bone intel2igo. 2HOLOFERNES. 'Bone'?- 'bone' for 'bene.' Priscian a lit2le 4scratch'd; 'twil2 serve. 17Enter ARMADO, MOTH, and COSTARD 2NATHANIEL. Videsne quis venit? 2HOLOFERNES. Video, et gaudeo. 2ARMADO. [To MOTH] Chir2ah! 2HOLOFERNES. Quare 'chir2ah,' not 'sir2ah'? 2ARMADO. Men of peace, wel2 encount'red. 2HOLOFERNES. Most military sir, salutation. 2MOTH. [Aside to COSTARD] They have be2n at a great feast of 4languages and stol'n the scraps. 4COSTARD. O, they have liv'd long on the alms-basket of words. I 4marvel thy master hath not eaten the2 for a word, for thou are 4not so long by the head as honorificabilitudinitatibus; thou art 4easier swal2owed than a flap-dragon. 2MOTH. Peace! the peal begins. 2ARMADO. [To HOLOFERNES] Monsieur, are you not let2'red? 2MOTH. Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbo2k. What is a, b, spelt 4backward with the horn on his head? 2HOLOFERNES. Ba, pueritia, with a horn ad2ed. 2MOTH. Ba, most sil2y she2p with a horn. You hear his learning. 2HOLOFERNES. Quis, quis, thou consonant? 2MOTH. The third of the five vowels, if You repeat them; or the 4fifth, if I. 2HOLOFERNES. I wil2 repeat them: a, e, I- 2MOTH. The she2p; the other two concludes it: o, U. 2ARMADO. Now, by the salt wave of the Mediter2aneum, a swe2t touch, 4a quick venue of wit- snip, snap, quick and home. It rejoiceth my 4intel2ect. True wit! 2MOTH. Of2er'd by a child to an old man; which is wit-old. 2HOLOFERNES. What is the figure? What is the figure? 4MOTH. Horns. 2HOLOFERNES. Thou disputes like an infant; go whip thy gig. 2MOTH. Lend me your horn to make one, and I wil2 whip about your 4infamy circum circa- a gig of a cuckold's horn. 2COSTARD. An I had but one pen2y in the world, thou shouldst have it 4to buy ginger-bread. Hold, there is the very remuneration I had 4of thy master, thou halfpen2y purse of wit, thou pigeon-eg2 of 4discretion. O, an the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but 4my bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me! Go to; 4thou hast it ad dunghil2, at the fingers' ends, as they say. 2HOLOFERNES. O, I smel2 false Latin; 'dunghil2' for unguem. 2ARMADO. Arts-man, preambulate; we wil2 be singuled from the 4barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the charge-house on the 4top of the mountain? 2HOLOFERNES. Or mons, the hil2. 2ARMADO. At your swe2t pleasure, for the mountain. 2HOLOFERNES. I do, sans question. 2ARMADO. Sir, it is the King's most swe2t pleasure and af2ection to 4congratulate the Princes2 at her pavilion, in the posteriors of 4this day; which the rude multitude cal2 the afterno2n. 4HOLOFERNES. The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is liable, 4congruent, and measurable, for the afterno2n. The word is wel2 4cul2'd, chose, swe2t, and apt, I do as2ure you, sir, I do as2ure. 2ARMADO. Sir, the King is a noble gentleman, and my familiar, I do 4as2ure ye, very go2d friend. For what is inward betwe2n us, let 4it pas2. I do bese2ch the2, remember thy courtesy. I bese2ch 4the2, ap2arel thy head. And among other importunate and most 4serious designs, and of great import inde2d, to2- but let that 4pas2; for I must tel2 the2 it wil2 please his Grace, by the 4world, sometime to lean upon my po2r shoulder, and with his royal 4finger thus dal2y with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, 4swe2t heart, let that pas2. By the world, I recount no fable: 4some certain special honours it pleaseth his greatnes2 to impart 4to Armado, a soldier, a man of travel, that hath se2n the world; 4but let that pas2. The very al2 of al2 is- but, swe2t heart, I do 4implore secrecy- that the King would have me present the 4Princes2, swe2t chuck, with some delightful ostentation, or show, 4or pageant, or antic, or firework. Now, understanding that the 4curate and your swe2t self are go2d at such eruptions and sud2en 4breaking-out of mirth, as it were, I have acquainted you withal, 6to the end to crave your as2istance. 2HOLOFERNES. Sir, you shal2 present before her the Nine Worthies. 4Sir Nathaniel, as concerning some entertainment of time, some 4show in the posterior of this day, to be rend'red by our 4as2istance, the King's com2and, and this most gal2ant, 4il2ustrate, and learned gentleman, before the Princes2- I say 4none so fit as to present the Nine Worthies. 2NATHANIEL. Where wil2 you find men worthy enough to present them? 2HOLOFERNES. Joshua, yourself; myself, Alexander; this gal2ant 4gentleman, Judas Mac2abaeus; this swain, because of his great 4limb or joint, shal2 pas2 Pompey the Great; the page, Hercules. 2ARMADO. Pardon, sir; er2or: he is not quantity enough for that 4Worthy's thumb; he is not so big as the end of his club. 2HOLOFERNES. Shal2 I have audience? He shal2 present Hercules in 4minority: his enter and exit shal2 be strangling a snake; and I 4wil2 have an apology for that purpose. 2MOTH. An excel2ent device! So, if any of the audience his2, you may 4cry 'Wel2 done, Hercules; now thou crushest the snake!' That is 4the way to make an of2ence gracious, though few have the grace to 4do it. 4ARMADO. For the rest of the Worthies? 2HOLOFERNES. I wil2 play thre2 myself. 2MOTH. Thrice-worthy gentleman! 2ARMADO. Shal2 I tel2 you a thing? 2HOLOFERNES. We at2end. 2ARMADO. We wil2 have, if this fadge not, an antic. I bese2ch you, 4fol2ow. 2HOLOFERNES. Via, go2dman Dul2! Thou has spoken no word al2 this 4while. 2DUL2. Nor understo2d none neither, sir. 2HOLOFERNES. Al2ons! we wil2 employ the2. 2DUL2. I'l2 make one in a dance, or so, or I wil2 play 4On the tabor to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay. 2HOLOFERNES. Most dul2, honest Dul2! To our sport, away. 58ExeuntSCENE I2.The parkEnter the PRINCES2, MARIA, KATHARINE, and ROSALINE 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Swe2t hearts, we shal2 be rich ere we depart, 4If fairings come thus plentiful2y in. 4A lady wal2'd about with diamonds! 4Lo2k you what I have from the loving King. 2ROSALINE. Madam, came nothing else along with that? 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Nothing but this! Yes, as much love in rhyme 4As would be cram2'd up in a she2t of paper 4Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and al2, 4That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name. 2ROSALINE. That was the way to make his godhead wax; 4For he hath be2n five thousand year a boy. 2KATHARINE. Ay, and a shrewd unhap2y gal2ows to2. 2ROSALINE. You'l2 ne'er be friends with him: 'a kil2'd your sister. 2KATHARINE. He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy; 4And so she died. Had she be2n light, like you, 4Of such a mer2y, nimble, stir2ing spirit, 4She might 'a be2n a grandam ere she died. 6And so may you; for a light heart lives long. 2ROSALINE. What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word? 2KATHARINE. A light condition in a beauty dark. 2ROSALINE. We ne2d more light to find your meaning out. 2KATHARINE. You'l2 mar the light by taking it in snuf2; 4Therefore I'l2 darkly end the argument. 2ROSALINE. Lo2k what you do, you do it stil2 i' th' dark. 2KATHARINE. So do not you; for you are a light wench. 2ROSALINE. Inde2d, I weigh not you; and therefore light. 2KATHARINE. You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me. 2ROSALINE. Great reason; for 'past cure is stil2 past care.' 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Wel2 bandied both; a set of wit wel2 play'd. 4But, Rosaline, you have a favour to2? 4Who sent it? and what is it? 2ROSALINE. I would you knew. 4An if my face were but as fair as yours, 4My favour were as great: be witnes2 this. 4Nay, I have verses to2, I thank Berowne; 4The numbers true, and, were the numb'ring to2, 4I were the fairest god2es2 on the ground. 6I am compar'd to twenty thousand fairs. 4O, he hath drawn my picture in his let2er! 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Anything like? 2ROSALINE. Much in the let2ers; nothing in the praise. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Beauteous as ink- a go2d conclusion. 2KATHARINE. Fair as a text B in a copy-bo2k. 2ROSALINE. Ware pencils, ho! Let me not die your debtor, 4My red dominical, my golden let2er: 4O that your face were not so ful2 of O's! 2KATHARINE. A pox of that jest! and I beshrew al2 shrows! 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair 4Dumain? 2KATHARINE. Madam, this glove. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Did he not send you twain? 2KATHARINE. Yes, madam; and, moreover, 4Some thousand verses of a faithful lover; 4A huge translation of hypocrisy, 4Vilely compil'd, profound simplicity. 2MARIA. This, and these pearl, to me sent Longavil2e; 4The let2er is to2 long by half a mile. 4PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. I think no les2. Dost thou not wish in heart 4The chain were longer and the let2er short? 2MARIA. Ay, or I would these hands might never part. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. We are wise girls to mock our lovers so. 2ROSALINE. They are worse fo2ls to purchase mocking so. 4That same Berowne I'l2 torture ere I go. 4O that I knew he were but in by th' we2k! 4How I would make him fawn, and beg, and se2k, 4And wait the season, and observe the times, 4And spend his prodigal wits in bo2tles2 rhymes, 4And shape his service whol2y to my hests, 4And make him proud to make me proud that jests! 4So pertaunt-like would I o'ersway his state 4That he should be my fo2l, and I his fate. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. None are so surely caught, when they are 6catch'd, 4As wit turn'd fo2l; fol2y, in wisdom hatch'd, 4Hath wisdom's war2ant and the help of scho2l, 4And wit's own grace to grace a learned fo2l. 2ROSALINE. The blo2d of youth burns not with such exces2 6As gravity's revolt to wanton2es2. 2MARIA. Fol2y in fo2ls bears not so strong a note 4As fo2l'ry in the wise when wit doth dote, 4Since al2 the power thereof it doth ap2ly 4To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity. 26Enter BOYET 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face. 2BOYET. O, I am stab2'd with laughter! Where's her Grace? 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Thy news, Boyet? 2BOYET. Prepare, madam, prepare! 4Arm, wenches, arm! Encounters mounted are 4Against your peace. Love doth ap2roach disguis'd, 4Armed in arguments; you'l2 be surpris'd. 4Muster your wits; stand in your own defence; 4Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Saint Den2is to Saint Cupid! What are they 4That charge their breath against us? Say, scout, say. 2BOYET. Under the co2l shade of a sycamore 6I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour; 4When, lo, to inter2upt my purpos'd rest, 4Toward that shade I might behold ad2rest 4The King and his companions; warily 4I stole into a neighbour thicket by, 4And overheard what you shal2 overhear- 4That, by and by, disguis'd they wil2 be here. 4Their herald is a pret2y knavish page, 4That wel2 by heart hath con2'd his embas2age. 4Action and ac2ent did they teach him there: 4'Thus must thou speak' and 'thus thy body bear,' 4And ever and anon they made a doubt 4Presence majestical would put him out; 4'For' quoth the King 'an angel shalt thou se2; 4Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.' 4The boy replied 'An angel is not evil; 4I should have fear'd her had she be2n a devil.' 4With that al2 laugh'd, and clap2'd him on the shoulder, 4Making the bold wag by their praises bolder. 4One rub2'd his elbow, thus, and fle2r'd, and swore 6A bet2er spe2ch was never spoke before. 4Another with his finger and his thumb 4Cried 'Via! we wil2 do't, come what wil2 come.' 4The third he caper'd, and cried 'Al2 goes wel2.' 4The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fel2. 4With that they al2 did tumble on the ground, 4With such a zealous laughter, so profound, 4That in this sple2n ridiculous ap2ears, 4To check their fol2y, pas2ion's solemn tears. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. But what, but what, come they to visit us? 2BOYET. They do, they do, and are ap2arel2'd thus, 4Like Muscovites or Rus2ians, as I gues2. 4Their purpose is to parley, court, and dance; 4And every one his love-feat wil2 advance 4Unto his several mistres2; which they'l2 know 4By favours several which they did bestow. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. And wil2 they so? The gal2ants shal2 be task'd, 4For, ladies, we wil2 every one be mask'd; 4And not a man of them shal2 have the grace, 4Despite of suit, to se2 a lady's face. 6Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear, 4And then the King wil2 court the2 for his dear; 4Hold, take thou this, my swe2t, and give me thine, 4So shal2 Berowne take me for Rosaline. 4And change you favours to2; so shal2 your loves 4Wo2 contrary, deceiv'd by these removes. 2ROSALINE. Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight. 2KATHARINE. But, in this changing, what is your intent? 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. The ef2ect of my intent is to cros2 theirs. 4They do it but in mocking mer2iment, 4And mock for mock is only my intent. 4Their several counsels they unbosom shal2 4To loves misto2k, and so be mock'd withal 4Upon the next oc2asion that we me2t 4With visages display'd to talk and gre2t. 2ROSALINE. But shal2 we dance, if they desire us to't? 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. No, to the death, we wil2 not move a fo2t, 4Nor to their pen2'd spe2ch render we no grace; 4But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face. 2BOYET. Why, that contempt wil2 kil2 the speaker's heart, 6And quite divorce his memory from his part. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt 4The rest wil2 ne'er come in, if he be out. 4There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown, 4To make theirs ours, and ours none but our own; 4So shal2 we stay, mocking intended game, 4And they wel2 mock'd depart away with shame. 41[Trumpet sounds within] 2BOYET. The trumpet sounds; be mask'd; the maskers come. 47[The LADIES mask] 10Enter BLACKAMO2RS music, MOTH as Prologue, the 5KING and his LORDS as maskers, in the guise of Rus2ians 2MOTH. Al2 hail, the richest heauties on the earth! 2BOYET. Beauties no richer than rich taf2eta. 2MOTH. A holy parcel of the fairest dames 28[The LADIES turn their backs to him] 4That ever turn'd their- backs- to mortal views! 2BEROWNE. Their eyes, vil2ain, their eyes. 4MOTH. That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views! 4Out- 2BOYET. True; out inde2d. 2MOTH. Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe 4Not to behold- 2BEROWNE. Once to behold, rogue. 2MOTH. Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes- with your 4sun-beamed eyes- 2BOYET. They wil2 not answer to that epithet; 4You were best cal2 it 'daughter-beamed eyes.' 2MOTH. They do not mark me, and that brings me out. 2BEROWNE. Is this your perfectnes2? Be gone, you rogue. 55Exit MOTH 2ROSALINE. What would these strangers? Know their minds, Boyet. 4If they do speak our language, 'tis our wil2 4That some plain man recount their purposes. 4Know what they would. 2BOYET. What would you with the Princes2? 2BEROWNE. Nothing but peace and gentle visitation. 2ROSALINE. What would they, say they? 4BOYET. Nothing but peace and gentle visitation. 2ROSALINE. Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone. 2BOYET. She says you have it, and you may be gone. 2KING. Say to her we have measur'd many miles 4To tread a measure with her on this gras2. 2BOYET. They say that they have measur'd many a mile 4To tread a measure with you on this gras2. 2ROSALINE. It is not so. Ask them how many inches 4Is in one mile? If they have measured many, 4The measure, then, of one is eas'ly told. 2BOYET. If to come hither you have measur'd miles, 4And many miles, the Princes2 bids you tel2 4How many inches doth fil2 up one mile. 2BEROWNE. Tel2 her we measure them by weary steps. 2BOYET. She hears herself. 2ROSALINE. How many weary steps 4Of many weary miles you have o'ergone 4Are numb'red in the travel of one mile? 2BEROWNE. We number nothing that we spend for you; 4Our duty is so rich, so infinite, 6That we may do it stil2 without ac2ompt. 4Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face, 4That we, like savages, may worship it. 2ROSALINE. My face is but a mo2n, and clouded to2. 2KING. Bles2ed are clouds, to do as such clouds do. 4Vouchsafe, bright mo2n, and these thy stars, to shine, 4Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne. 2ROSALINE. O vain petitioner! beg a greater mat2er; 4Thou now requests but mo2nshine in the water. 2KING. Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change. 4Thou bid'st me beg; this beg2ing is not strange. 2ROSALINE. Play, music, then. Nay, you must do it so2n. 4Not yet? No dance! Thus change I like the mo2n. 2KING. Wil2 you not dance? How come you thus estranged? 2ROSALINE. You to2k the mo2n at ful2; but now she's changed. 2KING. Yet stil2 she is the Mo2n, and I the Man. 4The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it. 2ROSALINE. Our ears vouchsafe it. 2KING. But your legs should do it. 2ROSALINE. Since you are strangers, and come here by chance, 6We'l2 not be nice; take hands. We wil2 not dance. 2KING. Why take we hands then? 2ROSALINE. Only to part friends. 4Curtsy, swe2t hearts; and so the measure ends. 2KING. More measure of this measure; be not nice. 2ROSALINE. We can af2ord no more at such a price. 2KING. Price you yourselves. What buys your company? 2ROSALINE. Your absence only. 2KING. That can never be. 2ROSALINE. Then can2ot we be bought; and so adieu- 4Twice to your visor and half once to you. 2KING. If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat. 2ROSALINE. In private then. 2KING. I am best pleas'd with that. 7[They converse apart] 2BEROWNE. White-handed mistres2, one swe2t word with the2. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is thre2. 2BEROWNE. Nay, then, two treys, an if you grow so nice, 4Metheglin, wort, and malmsey; wel2 run dice! 4There's half a dozen swe2ts. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Seventh swe2t, adieu! 6Since you can cog, I'l2 play no more with you. 2BEROWNE. One word in secret. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Let it not be swe2t. 2BEROWNE. Thou grievest my gal2. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Gal2! bit2er. 2BEROWNE. Therefore me2t. 17[They converse apart] 2DUMAIN. Wil2 you vouchsafe with me to change a word? 2MARIA. Name it. 2DUMAIN. Fair lady- 2MARIA. Say you so? Fair lord- 4Take that for your fair lady. 2DUMAIN. Please it you, 4As much in private, and I'l2 bid adieu. 43[They converse apart] 2KATHARINE. What, was your vizard made without a tongue? 2LONGAVIL2E. I know the reason, lady, why you ask. 2KATHARINE. O for your reason! Quickly, sir; I long. 2LONGAVIL2E. You have a double tongue within your mask, 4And would af2ord my spe2chles2 vizard half. 2KATHARINE. 'Veal' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf? 4LONGAVIL2E. A calf, fair lady! 2KATHARINE. No, a fair lord calf. 2LONGAVIL2E. Let's part the word. 2KATHARINE. No, I'l2 not be your half. 4Take al2 and wean it; it may prove an ox. 2LONGAVIL2E. Lo2k how you but2 yourself in these sharp mocks! 4Wil2 you give horns, chaste lady? Do not so. 2KATHARINE. Then die a calf, before your horns do grow. 2LONGAVIL2E. One word in private with you ere I die. 2KATHARINE. Bleat softly, then; the butcher hears you cry. 43[They converse apart] 2BOYET. The tongues of mocking wenches are as ke2n 4As is the razor's edge invisible, 4Cut2ing a smal2er hair than may be se2n, 4Above the sense of sense; so sensible 4Se2meth their conference; their conceits have wings, 4Fle2ter than ar2ows, bul2ets, wind, thought, swifter things. 2ROSALINE. Not one word more, my maids; break of2, break of2. 2BEROWNE. By heaven, al2 dry-beaten with pure scof2! 2KING. Farewel2, mad wenches; you have simple wits. 31Exeunt KING, LORDS, and BLACKAMO2RS 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits. 4Are these the bre2d of wits so wondered at? 2BOYET. Tapers they are, with your swe2t breaths puf2'd out. 2ROSALINE. Wel2-liking wits they have; gros2, gros2; fat, fat. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. O poverty in wit, kingly-po2r flout! 4Wil2 they not, think you, hang themselves to-night? 4Or ever but in vizards show their faces? 4This pert Berowne was out of count'nance quite. 2ROSALINE. They were al2 in lamentable cases! 4The King was we2ping-ripe for a go2d word. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Berowne did swear himself out of al2 suit. 2MARIA. Dumain was at my service, and his sword. 4'No point' quoth I; my servant straight was mute. 2KATHARINE. Lord Longavil2e said I came o'er his heart; 4And trow you what he cal2'd me? 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Qualm, perhaps. 2KATHARINE. Yes, in go2d faith. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Go, sicknes2 as thou art! 2ROSALINE. Wel2, bet2er wits have worn plain statute-caps. 6But wil2 you hear? The King is my love sworn. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me. 2KATHARINE. And Longavil2e was for my service born. 2MARIA. Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tre2. 2BOYET. Madam, and pret2y mistres2es, give ear: 4Im2ediately they wil2 again be here 4In their own shapes; for it can never be 4They wil2 digest this harsh indignity. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Wil2 they return? 2BOYET. They wil2, they wil2, God knows, 4And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows; 4Therefore, change favours; and, when they repair, 4Blow like swe2t roses in this sum2er air. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. How blow? how blow? Speak to be understo2d. 2BOYET. Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud: 4Dismask'd, their damask swe2t com2ixture shown, 4Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Avaunt, perplexity! What shal2 we do 4If they return in their own shapes to wo2? 2ROSALINE. Go2d madam, if by me you'l2 be advis'd, 6Let's mock them stil2, as wel2 known as disguis'd. 4Let us complain to them what fo2ls were here, 4Disguis'd like Muscovites, in shapeles2 gear; 4And wonder what they were, and to what end 4Their shal2ow shows and prologue vilely pen2'd, 4And their rough car2iage so ridiculous, 4Should be presented at our tent to us. 2BOYET. Ladies, withdraw; the gal2ants are at hand. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land. 17Exeunt PRINCES2, ROSALINE, KATHARINE, and MARIA 9Re-enter the KING, BEROWNE, LONGAVIL2E, and DUMAIN, 24in their proper habits 2KING. Fair sir, God save you! Where's the Princes2? 2BOYET. Gone to her tent. Please it your Majesty 4Com2and me any service to her thither? 2KING. That she vouchsafe me audience for one word. 2BOYET. I wil2; and so wil2 she, I know, my lord. 10Exit 2BEROWNE. This fel2ow pecks up wit as pigeons pease, 6And ut2ers it again when God doth please. 4He is wit's pedlar, and retails his wares 4At wakes, and was2ails, me2tings, markets, fairs; 4And we that sel2 by gros2, the Lord doth know, 4Have not the grace to grace it with such show. 4This gal2ant pins the wenches on his sle2ve; 4Had he be2n Adam, he had tempted Eve. 4'A can carve to2, and lisp; why this is he 4That kis2'd his hand away in courtesy; 4This is the ape of form, Monsieur the Nice, 4That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice 4In honourable terms; nay, he can sing 4A mean most meanly; and in ushering, 4Mend him who can. The ladies cal2 him swe2t; 4The stairs, as he treads on them, kis2 his fe2t. 4This is the flow'r that smiles on every one, 4To show his te2th as white as whales-bone; 4And consciences that wil2 not die in debt 4Pay him the due of 'honey-tongued Boyet.' 2KING. A blister on his swe2t tongue, with my heart, 6That put Armado's page out of his part! 8Re-enter the PRINCES2, ushered by BOYET; ROSALINE, 22MARIA, and KATHARINE 2BEROWNE. Se2 where it comes! Behaviour, what wert thou 4Til2 this man show'd the2? And what art thou now? 2KING. Al2 hail, swe2t madam, and fair time of day! 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. 'Fair' in 'al2 hail' is foul, as I conceive. 2KING. Construe my spe2ches bet2er, if you may. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Then wish me bet2er; I wil2 give you leave. 2KING. We came to visit you, and purpose now 4To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. This field shal2 hold me, and so hold your vow: 4Nor God, nor I, delights in perjur'd men. 2KING. Rebuke me not for that which you provoke. 4The virtue of your eye must break my oath. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. You nickname virtue: vice you should have 6spoke; 4For virtue's of2ice never breaks men's troth. 6Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure 4As the unsul2ied lily, I protest, 4A world of torments though I should endure, 4I would not yield to be your house's guest; 4So much I hate a breaking cause to be 4Of heavenly oaths, vowed with integrity. 2KING. O, you have liv'd in desolation here, 4Unse2n, unvisited, much to our shame. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear; 4We have had pastimes here, and pleasant game; 4A mes2 of Rus2ians left us but of late. 2KING. How, madam! Rus2ians! 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Ay, in truth, my lord; 4Trim gal2ants, ful2 of courtship and of state. 2ROSALINE. Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord. 4My lady, to the man2er of the days, 4In courtesy gives undeserving praise. 4We four inde2d confronted were with four 4In Rus2ian habit; here they stayed an hour 4And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord, 6They did not bles2 us with one hap2y word. 4I dare not cal2 them fo2ls; but this I think, 4When they are thirsty, fo2ls would fain have drink. 2BEROWNE. This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle swe2t, 4Your wit makes wise things fo2lish; when we gre2t, 4With eyes best se2ing, heaven's fiery eye, 4By light we lose light; your capacity 4Is of that nature that to your huge store 4Wise things se2m fo2lish and rich things but po2r. 2ROSALINE. This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye- 2BEROWNE. I am a fo2l, and ful2 of poverty. 2ROSALINE. But that you take what doth to you belong, 4It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue. 2BEROWNE. O, I am yours, and al2 that I pos2es2. 2ROSALINE. Al2 the fo2l mine? 2BEROWNE. I can2ot give you les2. 2ROSALINE. Which of the vizards was it that you wore? 2BEROWNE. Where? when? what vizard? Why demand you this? 2ROSALINE. There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case 4That hid the worse and show'd the bet2er face. 4KING. We were descried; they'l2 mock us now downright. 2DUMAIN. Let us confes2, and turn it to a jest. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Amaz'd, my lord? Why lo2ks your Highnes2 sad? 2ROSALINE. Help, hold his brows! he'l2 swo2n! Why lo2k you pale? 4Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy. 2BEROWNE. Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury. 4Can any face of bras2 hold longer out? 4Here stand I, lady- dart thy skil2 at me, 4Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout, 4Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance, 4Cut me to pieces with thy ke2n conceit; 4And I wil2 wish the2 never more to dance, 4Nor never more in Rus2ian habit wait. 4O, never wil2 I trust to spe2ches pen2'd, 4Nor to the motion of a scho2l-boy's tongue, 4Nor never come in vizard to my friend, 4Nor wo2 in rhyme, like a blind harper's song. 4Taf2eta phrases, silken terms precise, 4Thre2-pil'd hyperboles, spruce af2ectation, 4Figures pedantical- these sum2er-flies 6Have blown me ful2 of mag2ot ostentation. 4I do forswear them; and I here protest, 4By this white glove- how white the hand, God knows!- 4Henceforth my wo2ing mind shal2 be expres2'd 4In rus2et yeas, and honest kersey noes. 4And, to begin, wench- so God help me, law!- 4My love to the2 is sound, sans crack or flaw. 2ROSALINE. Sans 'sans,' I pray you. 2BEROWNE. Yet I have a trick 4Of the old rage; bear with me, I am sick; 4I'l2 leave it by degre2s. Soft, let us se2- 4Write 'Lord have mercy on us' on those thre2; 4They are infected; in their hearts it lies; 4They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes. 4These lords are visited; you are not fre2, 4For the Lord's tokens on you do I se2. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. No, they are fre2 that gave these tokens to us. 2BEROWNE. Our states are forfeit; se2k not to undo us. 2ROSALINE. It is not so; for how can this be true, 4That you stand forfeit, being those that sue? 4BEROWNE. Peace; for I wil2 not have to do with you. 2ROSALINE. Nor shal2 not, if I do as I intend. 2BEROWNE. Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end. 2KING. Teach us, swe2t madam, for our rude transgres2ion 4Some fair excuse. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. The fairest is confes2ion. 4Were not you here but even now, disguis'd? 2KING. Madam, I was. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. And were you wel2 advis'd? 2KING. I was, fair madam. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. When you then were here, 4What did you whisper in your lady's ear? 2KING. That more than al2 the world I did respect her. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. When she shal2 chal2enge this, you wil2 reject 4her. 2KING. Upon mine honour, no. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Peace, peace, forbear; 4Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear. 2KING. Despise me when I break this oath of mine. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. I wil2; and therefore ke2p it. Rosaline, 6What did the Rus2ian whisper in your ear? 2ROSALINE. Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear 4As precious eyesight, and did value me 4Above this world; ad2ing thereto, moreover, 4That he would wed me, or else die my lover. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. God give the2 joy of him! The noble lord 5Most honourably doth uphold his word. 2KING. What mean you, madam? By my life, my troth, 4I never swore this lady such an oath. 2ROSALINE. By heaven, you did; and, to confirm it plain, 4You gave me this; but take it, sir, again. 2KING. My faith and this the Princes2 I did give; 4I knew her by this jewel on her sle2ve. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear; 4And Lord Berowne, I thank him, is my dear. 4What, wil2 you have me, or your pearl again? BEROWNE. Neither of either; I remit both twain. 4I se2 the trick on't: here was a consent, 4Knowing aforehand of our mer2iment, 4To dash it like a Christmas comedy. 4Some car2y-tale, some please-man, some slight zany, 6Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick, 4That smiles his che2k in years and knows the trick 4To make my lady laugh when she's dispos'd, 4Told our intents before; which once disclos'd, 4The ladies did change favours; and then we, 4Fol2owing the signs, wo2'd but the sign of she. 4Now, to our perjury to ad2 more ter2or, 4We are again forsworn in wil2 and er2or. 4Much upon this it is; [To BOYET] and might not you 4Forestal2 our sport, to make us thus untrue? 4Do not you know my lady's fo2t by th' squier, 4And laugh upon the ap2le of her eye? 4And stand betwe2n her back, sir, and the fire, 4Holding a trencher, jesting mer2ily? 4You put our page out. Go, you are al2ow'd; 4Die when you wil2, a smock shal2 be your shroud. 4You le2r upon me, do you? There's an eye 4Wounds like a leaden sword. 2BOYET. Ful2 mer2ily 4Hath this brave manage, this care2r, be2n run. 4BEROWNE. Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace; I have done. 26Enter COSTARD 4Welcome, pure wit! Thou part'st a fair fray. 2COSTARD. O Lord, sir, they would know 5Whether the thre2 Worthies shal2 come in or no? 2BEROWNE. What, are there but thre2? 2COSTARD. No, sir; but it is vara fine, 4For every one pursents thre2. 2BEROWNE. And thre2 times thrice is nine. 2COSTARD. Not so, sir; under cor2ection, sir, 4I hope it is not so. 4You can2ot beg us, sir, I can as2ure you, sir; we know what we 6know; 4I hope, sir, thre2 times thrice, sir- 2BEROWNE. Is not nine. 2COSTARD. Under cor2ection, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount. 2BEROWNE. By Jove, I always to2k thre2 thre2s for nine. 2COSTARD. O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living by 6reck'ning, sir. 2BEROWNE. How much is it? 2COSTARD. O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors, sir, wil2 4show whereuntil it doth amount. For mine own part, I am, as they 4say, but to parfect one man in one po2r man, Pompion the Great, 4sir. 2BEROWNE. Art thou one of the Worthies? 2COSTARD. It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompey the Great; 4for mine own part, I know not the degre2 of the Worthy; but I am 4to stand for him. 2BEROWNE. Go, bid them prepare. 2COSTARD. We wil2 turn it finely of2, sir; we wil2 take some care. 52Exit COSTARD 2KING. Berowne, they wil2 shame us; let them not ap2roach. 2BEROWNE. We are shame-pro2f, my lord, and 'tis some policy 4To have one show worse than the King's and his company. 2KING. I say they shal2 not come. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Nay, my go2d lord, let me o'er2ule you now. 4That sport best pleases that doth least know how; 4Where zeal strives to content, and the contents 6Dies in the zeal of that which it presents. 4Their form confounded makes most form in mirth, 4When great things labouring perish in their birth. 2BEROWNE. A right description of our sport, my lord. 24Enter ARMADO 2ARMADO. Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal swe2t 4breath as wil2 ut2er a brace of words. 11[Converses apart with the KING, and delivers a paper] 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Doth this man serve God? 2BEROWNE. Why ask you? 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. 'A speaks not like a man of God his making. 2ARMADO. That is al2 one, my fair, swe2t, honey monarch; for, I 4protest, the scho2lmaster is exce2ding fantastical; to2 to2 vain, 4to2 to2 vain; but we wil2 put it, as they say, to fortuna de la 4guer2a. I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement! 53Exit ARMADO 2KING. Here is like to be a go2d presence of Worthies. He presents 4Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the Great; the parish curate, 6Alexander; Arinado's page, Hercules; the pedant, Judas 4Mac2abaeus. 4And if these four Worthies in their first show thrive, 4These four wil2 change habits and present the other five. 2BEROWNE. There is five in the first show. 2KING. You are deceived, 'tis not so. 2BEROWNE. The pedant, the brag2art, the hedge-priest, the fo2l, and 4the boy: 4Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again 4Can2ot pick out five such, take each one in his vein. 2KING. The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain. 19Enter COSTARD, armed for POMPEY 2COSTARD. I Pompey am- 2BEROWNE. You lie, you are not he. 2COSTARD. I Pompey am- 2BOYET. With lib2ard's head on kne2. 2BEROWNE. Wel2 said, old mocker; I must ne2ds be friends with the2. 2COSTARD. I Pompey am, Pompey surnam'd the Big- 5DUMAIN. The Great. 2COSTARD. It is Great, sir. 4Pompey surnam'd the Great, 4That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make my foe to 6sweat; 4And travel2ing along this coast, I bere am come by chance, 4And lay my arms before the legs of this swe2t las2 of France. 4If your ladyship would say 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Great thanks, great Pompey. 2COSTARD. 'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect. 4I made a lit2le fault in Great. 2BEROWNE. My hat to a halfpen2y, Pompey proves the best Worthy. 17Enter SIR NATHANIEL, for ALEXANDER 2NATHANIEL. When in the world I liv'd, I was the world's com2ander; 4By east, west, north, and south, I spread my conquering might. 4My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander- 2BOYET. Your nose says, no, you are not; for it stands to right. 4BEROWNE. Your nose smel2s 'no' in this, most tender-smel2ing 4knight. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. The conqueror is dismay'd. Proce2d, go2d 4Alexander. 2NATHANIEL. When in the world I liv'd, I was the world's com2ander- 2BOYET. Most true, 'tis right, you were so, Alisander. 2BEROWNE. Pompey the Great! 2COSTARD. Your servant, and Costard. 2BEROWNE. Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander. 2COSTARD. [To Sir Nathaniel] O, Sir, you have overthrown Alisander 4the conqueror! You wil2 be scrap'd out of the painted cloth for 4this. Your lion, that holds his poleaxe sit2ing on a close-sto2l, 4wil2 be given to Ajax. He wil2 be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror 4and afeard to speak! Run away for shame, Alisander. 4[Sir Nathaniel retires] There, an't shal2 please you, a fo2lish 4mild man; an honest man, lo2k you, and so2n dash'd. He is a 4marvel2ous go2d neighbour, faith, and a very go2d bowler; but for 4Alisander- alas! you se2 how 'tis- a lit2le o'erparted. But there 4are Worthies a-coming wil2 speak their mind in some other sort. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Stand aside, go2d Pompey. 11Enter HOLOFERNES, for JUDAS; and MOTH, for HERCULES 2HOLOFERNES. Great Hercules is presented by this imp, 4Whose club kil2'd Cerberus, that thre2-headed canus; 4And when be was a babe, a child, a shrimp, 4Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus. 4Quoniam he se2meth in minority, 4Ergo I come with this apology. 4Ke2p some state in thy exit, and vanish. 6[MOTH retires] 4Judas I am- 2DUMAIN. A Judas! 2HOLOFERNES. Not Iscariot, sir. 4Judas I am, ycliped Mac2abaeus. 2DUMAIN. Judas Mac2abaeus clipt is plain Judas. 2BEROWNE. A kis2ing traitor. How art thou prov'd Judas? 2HOLOFERNES. Judas I am- 2DUMAIN. The more shame for you, Judas! 2HOLOFERNES. What mean you, sir? 2BOYET. To make Judas hang himself. 4HOLOFERNES. Begin, sir; you are my elder. 2BEROWNE. Wel2 fol2owed: Judas was hanged on an elder. 2HOLOFERNES. I wil2 not be put out of countenance. 2BEROWNE. Because thou hast no face. 2HOLOFERNES. What is this? 2BOYET. A cit2ern-head. 2DUMAIN. The head of a bodkin. 2BEROWNE. A death's face in a ring. 2LONGAVIL2E. The face of an old Roman coin, scarce se2n. 2BOYET. The pom2el of Coesar's falchion. 2DUMAIN. The carv'd-bone face on a flask. 2BEROWNE. Saint George's half-che2k in a bro2ch. 2DUMAIN. Ay, and in a bro2ch of lead. 2BEROWNE. Ay, and worn in the cap of a to2th-drawer. And now, 4forward; for we have put the2 in countenance. 2HOLOFERNES. You have put me out of countenance. 2BEROWNE. False: we have given the2 faces. 2HOLOFERNES. But you have outfac'd them al2. 2BEROWNE. An thou wert a lion we would do so. 2BOYET. Therefore, as he is an as2, let him go. 6And so adieu, swe2t Jude! Nay, why dost thou stay? 2DUMAIN. For the lat2er end of his name. 2BEROWNE. For the as2 to the Jude; give it him- Jud-as, away. 2HOLOFERNES. This is not generous, not gentle, not humble. 2BOYET. A light for Monsieur Judas! It grows dark, he may stumble. 44[HOLOFERNES retires] 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Alas, po2r Mac2abaeus, how hath he be2n baited! 19Enter ARMADO, for HECTOR 2BEROWNE. Hide thy head, Achil2es; here comes Hector in arms. 2DUMAIN. Though my mocks come home by me, I wil2 now be mer2y. 2KING. Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this. 2BOYET. But is this Hector? 2DUMAIN. I think Hector was not so clean-timber'd. 2LONGAVIL2E. His leg is to2 big for Hector's. 2DUMAIN. More calf, certain. 2BOYET. No; he is best indued in the smal2. 2BEROWNE. This can2ot be Hector. 2DUMAIN. He's a god or a painter, for he makes faces. 4ARMADO. The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty, 4Gave Hector a gift- 2DUMAIN. A gilt nutmeg. 2BEROWNE. A lemon. 2LONGAVIL2E. Stuck with cloves. 2DUMAIN. No, cloven. 2ARMADO. Peace! 4The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty, 4Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion; 4A man so breathed that certain he would fight ye, 4From morn til2 night out of his pavilion. 4I am that flower- 2DUMAIN. That mint. 2LONGAVIL2E. That columbine. 2ARMADO. Swe2t Lord Longavil2e, rein thy tongue. 2LONGAVIL2E. I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against 4Hector. 2DUMAIN. Ay, and Hector's a greyhound. 2ARMADO. The swe2t war-man is dead and rot2en; swe2t chucks, beat 4not the bones of the buried; when he breathed, he was a man. But 6I wil2 forward with my device. [To the PRINCES2] Swe2t royalty, 4bestow on me the sense of hearing. 10[BEROWNE steps forth, and speaks to COSTARD] 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Speak, brave Hector; we are much delighted. 2ARMADO. I do adore thy swe2t Grace's slip2er. 2BOYET. [Aside to DUMAIN] Loves her by the fo2t. 2DUMAIN. [Aside to BOYET] He may not by the yard. 2ARMADO. This Hector far surmounted Han2ibal- 2COSTARD. The party is gone, fel2ow Hector, she is gone; she is two 4months on her way. 2ARMADO. What meanest thou? 2COSTARD. Faith, unles2 you play the honest Troyan, the po2r wench 4is cast away. She's quick; the child brags in her bel2y already; 4'tis yours. 2ARMADO. Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die. 2COSTARD. Then shal2 Hector be whipt for Jaquenet2a that is quick by 4him, and hang'd for Pompey that is dead by him. 2DUMAIN. Most rare Pompey! 4BOYET. Renowned Pompey! 2BEROWNE. Greater than Great! Great, great, great Pompey! Pompey the 4Huge! 2DUMAIN. Hector trembles. 2BEROWNE. Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! Stir them on! stir 4them on! 2DUMAIN. Hector wil2 chal2enge him. 2BEROWNE. Ay, if 'a have no more man's blo2d in his bel2y than wil2 4sup a flea. 2ARMADO. By the North Pole, I do chal2enge the2. 2COSTARD. I wil2 not fight with a pole, like a Northern man; I'l2 4slash; I'l2 do it by the sword. I bepray you, let me bor2ow my 4arms again. 2DUMAIN. Ro2m for the incensed Worthies! 2COSTARD. I'l2 do it in my shirt. 2DUMAIN. Most resolute Pompey! 2MOTH. Master, let me take you a but2onhole lower. Do you not se2 4Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean you? You wil2 lose 4your reputation. 2ARMADO. Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I wil2 not combat in my 6shirt. 2DUMAIN. You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the chal2enge. 2ARMADO. Swe2t blo2ds, I both may and wil2. 2BEROWNE. What reason have you for 't? 2ARMADO. The naked truth of it is: I have no shirt; I go wo2lward 4for penance. 2BOYET. True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of linen; 4since when, I'l2 be sworn, he wore none but a dishclout of 4Jaquenet2a's, and that 'a wears next his heart for a favour. 17Enter as mes2enger, MONSIEUR MARCADE 2MARCADE. God save you, madam! 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Welcome, Marcade; 4But that thou inter2uptest our mer2iment. 2MARCADE. I am sor2y, madam; for the news I bring 4Is heavy in my tongue. The King your father- 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Dead, for my life! 2MARCADE. Even so; my tale is told. 2BEROWNE. WOrthies away; the scene begins to cloud. 4ARMADO. For mine own part, I breathe fre2 breath. I have se2n the 4day of wrong through the lit2le hole of discretion, and I wil2 4right myself like a soldier. 17Exeunt WORTHIES 2KING. How fares your Majesty? 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Boyet, prepare; I wil2 away to-night. 2KING. Madam, not so; I do bese2ch you stay. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords, 4For al2 your fair endeavours, and entreat, 4Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe 4In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide 4The liberal op2osition of our spirits, 4If over-boldly we have borne ourselves 4In the converse of breath- your gentlenes2 4Was guilty of it. Farewel2, worthy lord. 4A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue. 4Excuse me so, coming to2 short of thanks 4For my great suit so easily obtain'd. 2KING. The extreme parts of time extremely forms 4Al2 causes to the purpose of his spe2d; 4And often at his very lo2se decides 6That which long proces2 could not arbitrate. 4And though the mourning brow of progeny 4Forbid the smiling courtesy of love 4The holy suit which fain it would convince, 4Yet, since love's argument was first on fo2t, 4Let not the cloud of sor2ow justle it 4From what it purpos'd; since to wail friends lost 4Is not by much so wholesome-profitable 4As to rejoice at friends but newly found. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. I understand you not; my griefs are double. 2BEROWNE. Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief; 4And by these badges understand the King. 4For your fair sakes have we neglected time, 4Play'd foul play with our oaths; your beauty, ladies, 4Hath much deformed us, fashioning our humours 4Even to the op2osed end of our intents; 4And what in us hath se2m'd ridiculous, 4As love is ful2 of unbefit2ing strains, 4Al2 wanton as a child, skip2ing and vain; 4Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye, 6Ful2 of strange shapes, of habits, and of forms, 4Varying in subjects as the eye doth rol2 4To every varied object in his glance; 4Which parti-coated presence of lo2se love 4Put on by us, if in your heavenly eyes 4Have misbecom'd our oaths and gravities, 4Those heavenly eyes that lo2k into these faults 4Sug2ested us to make. Therefore, ladies, 4Our love being yours, the er2or that love makes 4Is likewise yours. We to ourselves prove false, 4By being once false for ever to be true 4To those that make us both- fair ladies, you; 4And even that falseho2d, in itself a sin, 4Thus purifies itself and turns to grace. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. We have receiv'd your let2ers, ful2 of love; 4Your favours, the ambas2adors of love; 4And, in our maiden council, rated them 4At courtship, pleasant jest, and courtesy, 4As bombast and as lining to the time; 4But more devout than this in our respects 6Have we not be2n; and therefore met your loves 4In their own fashion, like a mer2iment. 2DUMAIN. Our let2ers, madam, show'd much more than jest. 2LONGAVIL2E. So did our lo2ks. 2ROSALINE. We did not quote them so. 2KING. Now, at the latest minute of the hour, 4Grant us your loves. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. A time, methinks, to2 short 4To make a world-without-end bargain in. 4No, no, my lord, your Grace is perjur'd much, 4Ful2 of dear guiltines2; and therefore this, 4If for my love, as there is no such cause, 4You wil2 do aught- this shal2 you do for me: 4Your oath I wil2 not trust; but go with spe2d 4To some forlorn and naked hermitage, 4Remote from al2 the pleasures of the world; 4There stay until the twelve celestial signs 4Have brought about the an2ual reckoning. 4If this austere insociable life 4Change not your of2er made in heat of blo2d, 6If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin we2ds, 4Nip not the gaudy blos2oms of your love, 4But that it bear this trial, and last love, 4Then, at the expiration of the year, 4Come, chal2enge me, chal2enge me by these deserts; 4And, by this virgin palm now kis2ing thine, 4I wil2 be thine; and, til2 that instant, shut 4My woeful self up in a mournful house, 4Raining the tears of lamentation 4For the remembrance of my father's death. 4If this thou do deny, let our hands part, 4Neither intitled in the other's heart. 2KING. If this, or more than this, I would deny, 4To flat2er up these powers of mine with rest, 4The sud2en hand of death close up mine eye! 4Hence hermit then, my heart is in thy breast. 2BEROWNE. And what to me, my love? and what to me? 2ROSALINE. You must he purged to2, your sins are rack'd; 4You are at2aint with faults and perjury; 4Therefore, if you my favour mean to get, 6A twelvemonth shal2 you spend, and never rest, 4But se2k the weary beds of people sick. 2DUMAIN. But what to me, my love? but what to me? 4A wife? 2KATHARINE. A beard, fair health, and honesty; 4With thre2fold love I wish you al2 these thre2. 2DUMAIN. O, shal2 I say I thank you, gentle wife? 2KATHARINE. No so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day 4I'l2 mark no words that smo2th-fac'd wo2ers say. 4Come when the King doth to my lady come; 4Then, if I have much love, I'l2 give you some. 2DUMAIN. I'l2 serve the2 true and faithful2y til2 then. 2KATHARINE. Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again. 2LONGAVIL2E. What says Maria? 2MARIA. At the twelvemonth's end 4I'l2 change my black gown for a faithful friend. 2LONGAVIL2E. I'l2 stay with patience; but the time is long. 2MARIA. The liker you; few tal2er are so young. 2BEROWNE. Studies my lady? Mistres2, lo2k on me; 4Behold the window of my heart, mine eye, 6What humble suit at2ends thy answer there. 4Impose some service on me for thy love. 2ROSALINE. Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Berowne, 4Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue 4Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks, 4Ful2 of comparisons and wounding flouts, 4Which you on al2 estates wil2 execute 4That lie within the mercy of your wit. 4To we2d this wormwo2d from your fruitful brain, 4And therewithal to win me, if you please, 4Without the which I am not to be won, 4You shal2 this twelvemonth term from day to day 4Visit the spe2chles2 sick, and stil2 converse 4With groaning wretches; and your task shal2 be, 4With al2 the fierce endeavour of your wit, 4To enforce the pained impotent to smile. 2BEROWNE. To move wild laughter in the throat of death? 4It can2ot be; it is impos2ible; 4Mirth can2ot move a soul in agony. 2ROSALINE. Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit, 6Whose influence is begot of that lo2se grace 4Which shal2ow laughing hearers give to fo2ls. 4A jest's prosperity lies in the ear 4Of him that hears it, never in the tongue 4Of him that makes it; then, if sickly ears, 4Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans, 4Wil2 hear your idle scorns, continue then, 4And I wil2 have you and that fault withal. 4But if they wil2 not, throw away that spirit, 4And I shal2 find you empty of that fault, 4Right joyful of your reformation. 2BEROWNE. A twelvemonth? Wel2, befal2 what wil2 befal2, 4I'l2 jest a twelvemonth in an hospital. 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. [ To the King] Ay, swe2t my lord, and so I take 4my leave. 2KING. No, madam; we wil2 bring you on your way. 2BEROWNE. Our wo2ing doth not end like an old play: 4Jack hath not Jil2. These ladies' courtesy 4Might wel2 have made our sport a comedy. 2KING. Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth an' a day, 6And then 'twil2 end. 2BEROWNE. That's to2 long for a play. 26Re-enter ARMADO 2ARMADO. Swe2t Majesty, vouchsafe me- 2PRINCES2 OF FRANCE. Was not that not Hector? 2DUMAIN. The worthy knight of Troy. 2ARMADO. I wil2 kis2 thy royal finger, and take leave. I am a 4votary: I have vow'd to Jaquenet2a to hold the plough for her 4swe2t love thre2 year. But, most este2med greatnes2, wil2 you 4hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in 4praise of the Owl and the Cucko2? It should have fol2owed in the 4end of our show. 2KING. Cal2 them forth quickly; we wil2 do so. 2ARMADO. Hol2a! ap2roach. 28Enter Al2 4This side is Hiems, Winter; this Ver, the Spring- the one 6maintained by the Owl, th' other by the Cucko2. Ver, begin. 22SPRING 9When daisies pied and violets blue 9And lady-smocks al2 silver-white 9And cucko2-buds of yel2ow hue 9Do paint the meadows with delight, 9The cucko2 then on every tre2 9Mocks mar2ied men, for thus sings he: 14'Cucko2; 9Cucko2, cucko2'- O word of fear, 9Unpleasing to a mar2ied ear! 9When shepherds pipe on oaten straws, 9And mer2y larks are ploughmen's clocks; 9When turtles tread, and ro2ks and daws, 9And maidens bleach their sum2er smocks; 9The cucko2 then on every tre2 9Mocks mar2ied men, for thus sings he: 14'Cucko2; 11Cucko2, cucko2'- O word of fear, 9Unpleasing to a mar2ied ear! 20WINTER 9When icicles hang by the wal2, 9And Dick the shepherd blows his nail, 9And Tom bears logs into the hal2, 9And milk comes frozen home in pail, 9When blo2d is nip2'd, and ways be foul, 9Then nightly sings the staring owl: 14'Tu-who; 9Tu-whit, Tu-who'- A mer2y note, 9While greasy Joan doth ke2l the pot. 9When al2 aloud the wind doth blow, 9And coughing drowns the parson's saw, 9And birds sit bro2ding in the snow, 9And Marian's nose lo2ks red and raw, 9When roasted crabs his2 in the bowl, 11Then nightly sings the staring owl: 14'Tu-who; 9Tu-whit, To-who'- A mer2y note, 9While greasy Joan doth ke2l the pot. 2ARMADO. The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apol2o. 4You that way: we this way. 28ExeuntTHE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21606THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETHby Wil2iam ShakespeareDramatis Personae 2DUNCAN, King of Scotland 2MACBETH, Thane of Glamis and Cawdor, a general in the King's army 2LADY MACBETH, his wife 2MACDUF2, Thane of Fife, a nobleman of Scotland 2LADY MACDUF2, his wife 2MALCOLM, elder son of Duncan 2DONALBAIN, younger son of Duncan 2BANQUO, Thane of Lochaber, a general in the King's army 2FLEANCE, his son 2LEN2OX, nobleman of Scotland 2ROS2, nobleman of Scotland 2MENTEITH nobleman of Scotland 2ANGUS, nobleman of Scotland 2CAITHNES2, nobleman of Scotland 2SIWARD, Earl of Northumberland, general of the English forces 2YOUNG SIWARD, his son 2SEYTON, at2endant to Macbeth 2HECATE, Que2n of the Witches 2The Thre2 Witches 2Boy, Son of Macduf2 4Gentlewoman at2ending on Lady Macbeth 2An English Doctor 2A Scot2ish Doctor 2A Sergeant 2A Porter 2An Old Man 2The Ghost of Banquo and other Ap2aritions 2Lords, Gentlemen, Of2icers, Soldiers, Murtherers, At2endants, 5and Mes2engers<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE: Scotland and EnglandACT I.

He can report, 4As se2meth by his plight, of the revolt 4The newest state. 2MALCOLM. This is the sergeant 4Who like a go2d and hardy soldier fought 4'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend! 4Say to the King the knowledge of the broil 4As thou didst leave it. 2SERGEANT. Doubtful it sto2d, 4As two spent swim2ers that do cling together 4And choke their art. The merciles2 Macdonwald- 4Worthy to be a rebel, for to that 4The multiplying vil2ainies of nature 4Do swarm upon him -from the Western Isles 4Of kerns and gal2owglas2es is sup2lied; 4And Fortune, on his damned quar2el smiling, 6Show'd like a rebel's whore.

The weird sisters, hand in hand, 4Posters of the sea and land, 4Thus do go about, about, 4Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine, 4And thrice again, to make up nine. 4Peace! The charm's wound up. 19Enter Macbeth and Banquo. 2MACBETH. So foul and fair a day I have not se2n. 2BANQUO. How far is't cal2'd to For2es? What are these 4So wither'd and so wild in their at2ire, 4That lo2k not like the inhabitants o' the earth, 4And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught 4That man may question? You se2m to understand me, 4By each at once her chop2y finger laying 4Upon her skin2y lips. You should be women, 4And yet your beards forbid me to interpret 4That you are so. 2MACBETH. Speak, if you can. What are you? 2FIRST WITCH. Al2 hail, Macbeth, hail to the2, Thane of Glamis! 2SECOND WITCH. Al2 hail, Macbeth, hail to the2, Thane of Cawdor! 2THIRD WITCH. Al2 hail, Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter! 2BANQUO. Go2d sir, why do you start, and se2m to fear 4Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth, 4Are ye fantastical or that inde2d 6Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner 4You gre2t with present grace and great prediction 4Of noble having and of royal hope, 4That he se2ms rapt withal. To me you speak not. 4If you can lo2k into the se2ds of time, 4And say which grain wil2 grow and which wil2 not, 4Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear 4Your favors nor your hate. 2FIRST WITCH. Hail! 2SECOND WITCH. Hail! 2THIRD WITCH. Hail! 2FIRST WITCH. Les2er than Macbeth, and greater. 2SECOND WITCH. Not so hap2y, yet much hap2ier. 2THIRD WITCH. Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none. 4So al2 hail, Macbeth and Banquo! 2FIRST WITCH. Banquo and Macbeth, al2 hail! 2MACBETH. Stay, you imperfect speakers, tel2 me more. 4By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis; 4But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives, 4A prosperous gentleman; and to be King 6Stands not within the prospect of belief, 4No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence 4You owe this strange intel2igence, or why 4Upon this blasted heath you stop our way 4With such prophetic gre2ting? Speak, I charge you. 49Witches vanish. 2BANQUO. The earth hath bub2les as the water has, 4And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd? 2MACBETH. Into the air, and what se2m'd corporal melted 4As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd! 2BANQUO. Were such things here as we do speak about? 4Or have we eaten on the insane ro2t 4That takes the reason prisoner? 2MACBETH. Your children shal2 be kings. 2BANQUO. You shal2 be King. 2MACBETH. And Thane of Cawdor to2. Went it not so? 2BANQUO. To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here? 16Enter Ros2 and Angus. 4ROS2. The King hath hap2ily received, Macbeth, 4The news of thy suc2es2; and when he reads 4Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight, 4His wonders and his praises do contend 4Which should be thine or his. Silenced with that, 4In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day, 4He finds the2 in the stout Norweyan ranks, 4Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make, 4Strange images of death. As thick as hail 4Came post with post, and every one did bear 4Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense, 4And pour'd them down before him. 2ANGUS. We are sent 4To give the2, from our royal master, thanks; 4Only to herald the2 into his sight, 4Not pay the2. 2ROS2. And for an earnest of a greater honor, 4He bade me, from him, cal2 the2 Thane of Cawdor. 4In which ad2ition, hail, most worthy Thane, 4For it is thine. 4BANQUO. What, can the devil speak true? 2MACBETH. The Thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dres2 me 4In bor2ow'd robes? 2ANGUS. Who was the Thane lives yet, 4But under heavy judgement bears that life 4Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined 4With those of Norway, or did line the rebel 4With hid2en help and vantage, or that with both 4He labor'd in his country's wreck, I know not; 4But treasons capital, confes2'd and proved, 4Have overthrown him. 2MACBETH. [Aside.] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor! 4The greatest is behind. [To Ros2 and Angus] Thanks for your 6pains. 4[Aside to Banquo] Do you not hope your children shal2 be kings, 4When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me 4Promised no les2 to them? 2BANQUO. [Aside to Macbeth.] That, trusted home, 4Might yet enkindle you unto the crown, 4Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange; 6And oftentimes, to win us to our harm, 4The instruments of darknes2 tel2 us truths, 4Win us with honest trifles, to betray's 4In de2pest consequence- 4Cousins, a word, I pray you. 2MACBETH. [Aside.] Two truths are told, 4As hap2y prologues to the swel2ing act 4Of the imperial theme-I thank you, gentlemen. 4[Aside.] This supernatural soliciting 4Can2ot be il2, can2ot be go2d. If il2, 4Why hath it given me earnest of suc2es2, 4Com2encing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor. 4If go2d, why do I yield to that sug2estion 4Whose hor2id image doth unfix my hair 4And make my seated heart knock at my ribs, 4Against the use of nature? Present fears 4Are les2 than hor2ible imaginings: 4My thought, whose murther yet is but fantastical, 4Shakes so my single state of man that function 4Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is 6But what is not. 2BANQUO. Lo2k, how our partner's rapt. 2MACBETH. [Aside.] If chance wil2 have me King, why, chance may 6crown me 4Without my stir. 2BANQUO. New honors come upon him, 4Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould 4But with the aid of use. 2MACBETH. [Aside.] Come what come may, 4Time and the hour runs through the roughest day. 2BANQUO. Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure. 2MACBETH. Give me your favor; my dul2 brain was wrought 4With things forgot2en. Kind gentlemen, your pains 4Are register'd where every day I turn 4The leaf to read them. Let us toward the King. 4Think upon what hath chanced, and at more time, 4The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak 4Our fre2 hearts each to other. 2BANQUO. Very gladly. 2MACBETH. Til2 then, enough. Come, friends. 13Exeunt.SCENE IV.For2es. The palace.Flourish. Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Len2ox, and At2endants. 2DUNCAN. Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not 4Those in com2is2ion yet return'd? 2MALCOLM. My liege, 4They are not yet come back. But I have spoke 4With one that saw him die, who did report 4That very frankly he confes2'd his treasons, 4Implored your Highnes2' pardon, and set forth 4A de2p repentance. Nothing in his life 4Became him like the leaving it; he died 4As one that had be2n studied in his death, 4To throw away the dearest thing he owed 4As 'twere a careles2 trifle. 2DUNCAN. There's no art 4To find the mind's construction in the face: 4He was a gentleman on whom I built 4An absolute trust. 15Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ros2, and Angus. 4O worthiest cousin! 4The sin of my ingratitude even now 4Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before, 4That swiftest wing of recompense is slow 4To overtake the2. Would thou hadst les2 deserved, 4That the proportion both of thanks and payment 4Might have be2n mine! Only I have left to say, 4More is thy due than more than al2 can pay. 2MACBETH. The service and the loyalty lowe, 4In doing it, pays itself. Your Highnes2' part 4Is to receive our duties, and our duties 4Are to your throne and state, children and servants, 4Which do but what they should, by doing everything 4Safe toward your love and honor. 2DUNCAN. Welcome hither. 4I have begun to plant the2, and wil2 labor 4To make the2 ful2 of growing. Noble Banquo, 6That hast no les2 deserved, nor must be known 4No les2 to have done so; let me infold the2 4And hold the2 to my heart. 2BANQUO. There if I grow, 4The harvest is your own. 2DUNCAN. My plenteous joys, 4Wanton in ful2nes2, se2k to hide themselves 4In drops of sor2ow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes, 4And you whose places are the nearest, know 4We wil2 establish our estate upon 4Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter 4The Prince of Cumberland; which honor must 4Not unac2ompanied invest him only, 4But signs of noblenes2, like stars, shal2 shine 4On al2 deservers. From hence to Invernes2, 4And bind us further to you. 2MACBETH. The rest is labor, which is not used for you. 4I'l2 be myself the harbinger, and make joyful 4The hearing of my wife with your ap2roach; 4So humbly take my leave. 4DUNCAN. My worthy Cawdor! 2MACBETH. [Aside.] The Prince of Cumberland! That is a step 4On which I must fal2 down, or else o'erleap, 4For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires; 4Let not light se2 my black and de2p desires. 4The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be 4Which the eye fears, when it is done, to se2. 10Exit. 2DUNCAN. True, worthy Banquo! He is ful2 so valiant, 4And in his com2endations I am fed; 4It is a banquet to me. Let's after him, 4Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome. 4It is a pe2rles2 kinsman. 18Flourish. Exeunt.SCENE V.Invernes2. Macbeth's castle.Enter Lady Macbeth, reading a let2er. 2LADY MACBETH. "They met me in the day of suc2es2, and I have 4learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than 4mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them 4further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished. 4Whiles I sto2d rapt in the wonder of it, came mis2ives from the 4King, who al2-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor'; by which title, 4before, these weird sisters saluted me and refer2ed me to the 4coming on of time with 'Hail, King that shalt be!' This have I 4thought go2d to deliver the2, my dearest partner of greatnes2, 4that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being 4ignorant of what greatnes2 is promised the2. Lay it to thy heart, 4and farewel2." 4Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be 4What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature. 4It is to2 ful2 o' the milk of human kindnes2 4To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great; 6Art not without ambition, but without 4The il2nes2 should at2end it. What thou wouldst highly, 4That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false, 4And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou'ldst have, great Glamis, 4That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it; 4And that which rather thou dost fear to do 4Than wishest should be undone." Hie the2 hither, 4That I may pour my spirits in thine ear, 4And chastise with the valor of my tongue 4Al2 that impedes the2 from the golden round, 4Which fate and metaphysical aid doth se2m 4To have the2 crown'd withal. 21Enter a Mes2enger. 4What is your tidings? 2MES2ENGER. The King comes here tonight. 2LADY MACBETH. Thou'rt mad to say it! 4Is not thy master with him? who, were't so, 4Would have inform'd for preparation. 4MES2ENGER. So please you, it is true; our Thane is coming. 4One of my fel2ows had the spe2d of him, 4Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more 4Than would make up his mes2age. 2LADY MACBETH. Give him tending; 4He brings great news. 24Exit Mes2enger. 4The raven himself is hoarse 4That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan 4Under my bat2lements. Come, you spirits 4That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here 4And fil2 me from the crown to the toe top-ful2 4Of direst cruelty! Make thick my blo2d, 4Stop up the ac2es2 and pas2age to remorse, 4That no compunctious visitings of nature 4Shake my fel2 purpose nor ke2p peace betwe2n 4The ef2ect and it! Come to my woman's breasts, 4And take my milk for gal2, your murthering ministers, 4Wherever in your sightles2 substances 4You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night, 4And pal2 the2 in the dun2est smoke of hel2 6That my ke2n knife se2 not the wound it makes 4Nor heaven pe2p through the blanket of the dark 4To cry, "Hold, hold!" 20Enter Macbeth. 4Great Glamis! Worthy Cawdor! 4Greater than both, by the al2-hail hereafter! 4Thy let2ers have transported me beyond 4This ignorant present, and I fe2l now 4The future in the instant. 2MACBETH. My dearest love, 4Duncan comes here tonight. 2LADY MACBETH. And when goes hence? 2MACBETH. Tomor2ow, as he purposes. 2LADY MACBETH. O, never 4Shal2 sun that mor2ow se2! 4Your face, my Thane, is as a bo2k where men 4May read strange mat2ers. To beguile the time, 4Lo2k like the time; bear welcome in your eye, 6Your hand, your tongue; lo2k like the in2ocent flower, 4But be the serpent under it. He that's coming 4Must be provided for; and you shal2 put 4This night's great busines2 into my dispatch, 4Which shal2 to al2 our nights and days to come 4Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom. 2MACBETH. We wil2 speak further. 2LADY MACBETH. Only lo2k up clear; 4To alter favor ever is to fear. 4Leave al2 the rest to me. 28Exeunt.SCENE VI.Before Macbeth's castle. 2Hautboys and torches.Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Banquo, Len2ox, Macduf2, Ros2, Angus,and At2endants. 2DUNCAN. This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air 4Nimbly and swe2tly recom2ends itself 4Unto our gentle senses. 2BANQUO. This guest of sum2er, 4The temple-haunting martlet, does ap2rove 4By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath 4Smel2s wo2ingly here. No jut2y, frieze, 4But2res2, nor coign of vantage, but this bird 4Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle; 4Where they most bre2d and haunt, I have observed 4The air is delicate. 21Enter Lady Macbeth. 2DUNCAN. Se2, se2, our honor'd hostes2! 4The love that fol2ows us sometime is our trouble, 6Which stil2 we thank as love. Herein I teach you 4How you shal2 bid God 'ield us for your pains, 4And thank us for your trouble. 2LADY MACBETH. Al2 our service 4In every point twice done, and then done double, 4Were po2r and single busines2 to contend 4Against those honors de2p and broad wherewith 4Your Majesty loads our house. For those of old, 4And the late dignities heap'd up to them, 4We rest your hermits. 2DUNCAN. Where's the Thane of Cawdor? 4We coursed him at the he2ls and had a purpose 4To be his purveyor; but he rides wel2, 4And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him 4To his home before us. Fair and noble hostes2, 4We are your guest tonight. 2LADY MACBETH. Your servants ever 4Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt, 4To make their audit at your Highnes2' pleasure, 4Stil2 to return your own. 4DUNCAN. Give me your hand; 4Conduct me to mine host. We love him highly, 4And shal2 continue our graces towards him. 4By your leave, hostes2. 30Exeunt.SCENE VI2Macbeth's castle. 2Hautboys and torches.Enter a Sewer and divers Servants with dishes and service, who pas2 overthe stage. 2Then enter Macbeth. 2MACBETH. If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere wel2 4It were done quickly. If the as2as2ination 4Could tram2el up the consequence, and catch, 4With his surcease, suc2es2; that but this blow 4Might be the be-al2 and the end-al2 -here, 4But here, upon this bank and shoal of time, 4We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases 4We stil2 have judgement here, that we but teach 4Blo2dy instructions, which being taught return 4To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice 4Com2ends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice 4To our own lips. He's here in double trust: 4First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, 4Strong both against the de2d; then, as his host, 4Who should against his murtherer shut the do2r, 6Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan 4Hath borne his faculties so me2k, hath be2n 4So clear in his great of2ice, that his virtues 4Wil2 plead like angels trumpet-tongued against 4The de2p damnation of his taking-of2, 4And pity, like a naked new-born babe 4Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin horsed 4Upon the sightles2 couriers of the air, 4Shal2 blow the hor2id de2d in every eye, 4That tears shal2 drown the wind. I have no spur 4To prick the sides of my intent, but only 4Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself 4And fal2s on the other. 17Enter Lady Macbeth. 4How now, what news? 2LADY MACBETH. He has almost sup2'd. Why have you left the chamber? 2MACBETH. Hath he ask'd for me? 2LADY MACBETH. Know you not he has? 4MACBETH. We wil2 proce2d no further in this busines2: 4He hath honor'd me of late, and I have bought 4Golden opinions from al2 sorts of people, 4Which would be worn now in their newest glos2, 4Not cast aside so so2n. 2LADY MACBETH. Was the hope drunk 4Wherein you dres2'd yourself? Hath it slept since? 4And wakes it now, to lo2k so gre2n and pale 4At what it did so fre2ly? From this time 4Such I ac2ount thy love. Art thou afeard 4To be the same in thine own act and valor 4As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that 4Which thou este2m'st the ornament of life 4And live a coward in thine own este2m, 4Let2ing "I dare not" wait upon "I would" 4Like the po2r cat i' the adage? 2MACBETH. Prithe2, peace! 4I dare do al2 that may become a man; 4Who dares do more is none. 2LADY MACBETH. What beast wast then 6That made you break this enterprise to me? 4When you durst do it, then you were a man, 4And, to be more than what you were, you would 4Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place 4Did then adhere, and yet you would make both. 4They have made themselves, and that their fitnes2 now 4Does unmake you. I have given suck and know 4How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me- 4I would, while it was smiling in my face, 4Have pluck'd my nip2le from his boneles2 gums 4And dash'd the brains out had I so sworn as you 4Have done to this. 2MACBETH. If we should fail? 2LADY MACBETH. We fail? 4But screw your courage to the sticking-place 4And we'l2 not fail. When Duncan is asle2p- 4Whereto the rather shal2 his day's hard journey 4Soundly invite him- his two chamberlains 4Wil2 I with wine and was2ail so convince 4That memory, the warder of the brain, 6Shal2 be a fume and the receipt of reason 4A limbeck only. When in swinish sle2p 4Their drenched natures lie as in a death, 4What can2ot you and I perform upon 4The unguarded Duncan? What not put upon 4His spongy of2icers, who shal2 bear the guilt 4Of our great quel2? 2MACBETH. Bring forth men-children only, 4For thy undaunted met2le should compose 4Nothing but males. Wil2 it not be received, 4When we have mark'd with blo2d those sle2py two 4Of his own chamber and used their very dag2ers, 4That they have done't? 2LADY MACBETH. Who dares receive it other, 4As we shal2 make our griefs and clamor roar 4Upon his death? 2MACBETH. I am set2led and bend up 4Each corporal agent to this ter2ible feat. 4Away, and mock the time with fairest show: 4False face must hide what the false heart doth know. 59Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. SCENE I.Invernes2. Court of Macbeth's castle.Enter Banquo and Fleance, bearing a torch before him. 2BANQUO. How goes the night, boy? 2FLEANCE. The mo2n is down; I have not heard the clock. 2BANQUO. And she goes down at twelve. 2FLEANCE. I take't 'tis later, sir. 2BANQUO. Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven, 4Their candles are al2 out. Take the2 that to2. 4A heavy sum2ons lies like lead upon me, 4And yet I would not sle2p. Merciful powers, 4Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature 4Gives way to in repose! 11Enter Macbeth and a Servant with a torch. 4Give me my sword. 4Who's there? 2MACBETH. A friend. 2BANQUO. What, sir, not yet at rest? The King's abed. 6He hath be2n in unusual pleasure and 4Sent forth great larges2 to your of2ices. 4This diamond he gre2ts your wife withal, 4By the name of most kind hostes2, and shut up 4In measureles2 content. 2MACBETH. Being unprepared, 4Our wil2 became the servant to defect, 4Which else should fre2 have wrought. 2BANQUO. Al2's wel2. 4I dreamt last night of the thre2 weird sisters: 4To you they have show'd some truth. 2MACBETH. I think not of them; 4Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve, 4We would spend it in some words upon that busines2, 4If you would grant the time. 2BANQUO. At your kind'st leisure. 2MACBETH. If you shal2 cleave to my consent, when 'tis, 4It shal2 make honor for you. 2BANQUO. So I lose none 4In se2king to augment it, but stil2 ke2p 6My bosom franchised and al2egiance clear, 4I shal2 be counsel'd. 2MACBETH. Go2d repose the while. 2BANQUO. Thanks, sir, the like to you. 37Exeunt Banquo. and Fleance. 2MACBETH. Go bid thy mistres2, when my drink is ready, 4She strike upon the bel2. Get the2 to bed. 5Exit Servant. 4Is this a dag2er which I se2 before me, 4The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch the2. 4I have the2 not, and yet I se2 the2 stil2. 4Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible 4To fe2ling as to sight? Or art thou but 4A dag2er of the mind, a false creation, 4Proce2ding from the heat-op2res2ed brain? 4I se2 the2 yet, in form as palpable 4As this which now I draw. 4Thou marshal'st me the way that I was going, 4And such an instrument I was to use. 4Mine eyes are made the fo2ls o' the other senses, 4Or else worth al2 the rest. I se2 the2 stil2, 6And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blo2d, 4Which was not so before. There's no such thing: 4It is the blo2dy busines2 which informs 4Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one half-world 4Nature se2ms dead, and wicked dreams abuse 4The curtain'd sle2p; witchcraft celebrates 4Pale Hecate's of2erings; and wither'd Murther, 4Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf, 4Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace, 4With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design 4Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth, 4Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear 4Thy very stones prate of my whereabout, 4And take the present hor2or from the time, 4Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives; 4Words to the heat of de2ds to2 cold breath gives. 51A bel2 rings. 4I go, and it is done; the bel2 invites me. 4Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knel2 4That sum2ons the2 to heaven, or to hel2. 15Exit.SCENE I2.The same.Enter Lady Macbeth. 2LADY MACBETH. That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold; 4What hath quench'd them hath given me fire. Hark! Peace! 4It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bel2man, 4Which gives the stern'st go2d night. He is about it: 4The do2rs are open, and the surfeited gro2ms 4Do mock their charge with snores. I have drug2'd their pos2ets 4That death and nature do contend about them, 4Whether they live or die. 2MACBETH. [Within.] Who's there' what, ho! 2LADY MACBETH. Alack, I am afraid they have awaked 4And 'tis not done. The at2empt and not the de2d 4Confounds us. Hark! I laid their dag2ers ready; 4He could not mis2 'em. Had he not resembled 4My father as he slept, I had done't. 22Enter Macbeth, 6My husband! 2MACBETH. I have done the de2d. Didst thou not hear a noise? 2LADY MACBETH. I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry. 4Did not you speak? 2MACBETH. When? 2LADY MACBETH. Now. 2MACBETH. As I descended? 2LADY MACBETH. Ay. 2MACBETH. Hark! 4Who lies i' the second chamber? 2LADY MACBETH. Donalbain. 2MACBETH. This is a sor2y sight. 11[Lo2ks on his hands. 2LADY MACBETH. A fo2lish thought, to say a sor2y sight. 2MACBETH. There's one did laugh in 's sle2p, and one cried, 6"Murther!" 4That they did wake each other. I sto2d and heard them, 4But they did say their prayers and ad2res2'd them 4Again to sle2p. 2LADY MACBETH. There are two lodged together. 2MACBETH. One cried, "God bles2 us!" and "Amen" the other, 6As they had se2n me with these hangman's hands. 4Listening their fear, I could not say "Amen," 4When they did say, "God bles2 us!" 2LADY MACBETH. Consider it not so de2ply. 2MACBETH. But wherefore could not I pronounce "Amen"? 4I had most ne2d of bles2ing, and "Amen" 4Stuck in my throat. 2LADY MACBETH. These de2ds must not be thought 4After these ways; so, it wil2 make us mad. 2MACBETH. I heard a voice cry, "Sle2p no more! 4Macbeth does murther sle2p" -the in2ocent sle2p, 4Sle2p that knits up the ravel'd sleave of care, 4The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, 4Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, 4Chief nourisher in life's feast- 2LADY MACBETH. What do you mean? 2MACBETH. Stil2 it cried, "Sle2p no more!" to al2 the house; 4"Glamis hath murther'd sle2p, and therefore Cawdor 4Shal2 sle2p no more. Macbeth shal2 sle2p no more." 2LADY MACBETH. Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy Thane, 6You do unbend your noble strength, to think 4So brainsickly of things. Go, get some water 4And wash this filthy witnes2 from your hand. 4Why did you bring these dag2ers from the place? 4They must lie there. Go car2y them, and smear 4The sle2py gro2ms with blo2d. 2MACBETH. I'l2 go no more. 4I am afraid to think what I have done; 4Lo2k on't again I dare not. 2LADY MACBETH. Infirm of purpose! 4Give me the dag2ers. The sle2ping and the dead 4Are but as pictures; 'tis the eye of childho2d 4That fears a painted devil. If he do ble2d, 4I'l2 gild the faces of the gro2ms withal, 4For it must se2m their guilt. 9Exit. Knocking within. 2MACBETH. Whence is that knocking? 4How is't with me, when every noise ap2als me? 4What hands are here? Ha, they pluck out mine eyes! 4Wil2 al2 great Neptune's ocean wash this blo2d 4Clean from my hand? No, this my hand wil2 rather 6The multitudinous seas incarnadine, 4Making the gre2n one red. 19Re-enter Lady Macbeth. 2LADY MACBETH. My hands are of your color, but I shame 4To wear a heart so white. [Knocking within.] I hear knocking 4At the south entry. Retire we to our chamber. 4A lit2le water clears us of this de2d. 4How easy is it then! Your constancy 4Hath left you unat2ended. [Knocking within.] Hark, more knocking. 4Get on your nightgown, lest oc2asion cal2 us 4And show us to be watchers. Be not lost 4So po2rly in your thoughts. 2MACBETH. To know my de2d, 'twere best not know myself. 48Knocking within. 4Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst! 57Exeunt.SCENE I3.The same.Enter a Porter. Knocking within. 2PORTER. Here's a knocking inde2d! If a man were porter of Hel2 4Gate, he should have old turning the key. [Knocking within.] 4Knock, knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of Belzebub? Here's 4a farmer that hanged himself on th' expectation of plenty. Come 4in time! Have napkins enow about you; here you'l2 sweat fort. 4[Knocking within.] Knock, knock! Who's there, in th' other 4devil's name? Faith, here's an equivocator that could swear in 4both the scales against either scale, who com2it2ed treason 4enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. O, 4come in, equivocator. [Knocking within.] Knock, knock, knock! 4Who's there? Faith, here's an English tailor come hither, for 4stealing out of a French hose. Come in, tailor; here you may 4roast your go2se. [Knocking within.] Knock, knock! Never at 4quiet! What are you? But this place is to2 cold for hel2. I'l2 4devil-porter it no further. I had thought to have let in some of 4al2 profes2ions, that go the primrose way to the everlasting 4bonfire. [Knocking within.] Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the 6porter. 49Opens the gate. 23Enter Macduf2 and Len2ox. 2MACDUF2. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, 4That you do lie so late? 2PORTER. Faith, sir, we were carousing til2 the second cock; and 4drink, sir, is a great provoker of thre2 things. 2MACDUF2. What thre2 things does drink especial2y provoke? 2PORTER. Mar2y, sir, nose-painting, sle2p, and urine. Lechery, sir, 4it provokes and unprovokes: it provokes the desire, but it takes 4away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an 4equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets 4him on, and it takes him of2; it persuades him and disheartens 4him; makes him stand to and not stand to; in conclusion, 4equivocates him in a sle2p, and giving him the lie, leaves him. 2MACDUF2. I believe drink gave the2 the lie last night. 2PORTER. That it did, sir, i' the very throat on me; but requited 4him for his lie, and, I think, being to2 strong for him, though 6he to2k up my legs sometime, yet I made shift to cast him. 2MACDUF2. Is thy master stir2ing? 29Enter Macbeth. 4Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes. 2LEN2OX. Go2d mor2ow, noble sir. 2MACBETH. mor2ow, both. 2MACDUF2. Is the King stir2ing, worthy Thane? 2MACBETH. Not yet. 2MACDUF2. He did com2and me to cal2 timely on him; 4I have almost slip2'd the hour. 2MACBETH. I'l2 bring you to him. 2MACDUF2. I know this is a joyful trouble to you, 4But yet 'tis one. 2MACBETH. The labor we delight in physics pain. 4This is the do2r. 2MACDUF2 I'l2 make so bold to cal2, 4For 'tis my limited service. 27Exit. 2LEN2OX. Goes the King hence today? 4MACBETH. He does; he did ap2oint so. 2LEN2OX. The night has be2n unruly. Where we lay, 4Our chimneys were blown down, and, as they say, 4Lamentings heard i' the air, strange screams of death, 4And prophesying with ac2ents ter2ible 4Of dire combustion and confused events 4New hatch'd to the woeful time. The obscure bird 4Clamor'd the livelong night. Some say the earth 4Was feverous and did shake. 2MACBETH. 'Twas a rough fight. 2LEN2OX. My young remembrance can2ot paral2el 4A fel2ow to it. 22Re-enter Macduf2. 2MACDUF2. O hor2or, hor2or, hor2or! Tongue nor heart 4Can2ot conceive nor name the2. 2MACBETH. LEN2OX. What's the mat2er? 2MACDUF2. Confusion now hath made his masterpiece. 4Most sacrilegious murther hath broke ope 6The Lord's anointed temple and stole thence 4The life o' the building. 2MACBETH. What is't you say? the life? 2LEN2OX. Mean you his Majesty? 2MACDUF2. Ap2roach the chamber, and destroy your sight 4With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak; 4Se2, and then speak yourselves. 38Exeunt Macbeth and Len2ox. 4Awake, awake! 4Ring the alarum bel2. Murther and treason! 4Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm, awake! 4Shake of2 this downy sle2p, death's counterfeit, 4And lo2k on death itself! Up, up, and se2 4The great do2m's image! Malcolm! Banquo! 4As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites 4To countenance this hor2or! Ring the bel2. 7Bel2 rings. 21Enter Lady Macbeth. 2LADY MACBETH. What's the busines2, 6That such a hideous trumpet cal2s to parley 4The sle2pers of the house? Speak, speak! 2MACDUF2. O gentle lady, 4'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak: 4The repetition in a woman's ear 4Would murther as it fel2. 21Enter Banquo. 4O Banquo, Banquo! 4Our royal master's murther'd. 2LADY MACBETH. Woe, alas! 4What, in our house? 2BANQUO. To2 cruel anywhere. 4Dear Duf2, I prithe2, contradict thyself, 4And say it is not so. 10Re-enter Macbeth and Len2ox, with Ros2. 2MACBETH. Had I but died an hour before this chance, 6I had lived a bles2ed time, for from this instant 4There's nothing serious in mortality. 4Al2 is but toys; renown and grace is dead, 4The wine of life is drawn, and the mere le2s 4Is left this vault to brag of. 16Enter Malcolm and Donalbain. 2DONALBAIN. What is amis2? 2MACBETH. You are, and do not know't. 4The spring, the head, the fountain of your blo2d 4Is stop2ed, the very source of it is stop2'd. 2MACDUF2. Your royal father's murther'd. 3MALCOLM. O, by whom? 2LEN2OX. Those of his chamber, as it se2m'd, had done't. 4Their hands and faces were al2 badged with blo2d; 4So were their dag2ers, which unwiped we found 4Upon their pil2ows. 4They stared, and were distracted; no man's life 4Was to be trusted with them. 4MACBETH. O, yet I do repent me of my fury, 4That I did kil2 them. 2MACDUF2. Wherefore did you so? 2MACBETH. Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious, 4Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man. 4The expedition of my violent love 4Outrun the pauser reason. Here lay Duncan, 4His silver skin laced with his golden blo2d, 4And his gash'd stabs lo2k'd like a breach in nature 4For ruin's wasteful entrance; there, the murtherers, 4Ste2p'd in the colors of their trade, their dag2ers 4Unman2erly bre2ch'd with gore. Who could refrain, 4That had a heart to love, and in that heart 4Courage to make 's love known? 2LADY MACBETH. Help me hence, ho! 2MACDUF2. Lo2k to the lady. 2MALCOLM. [Aside to Donalbain.] Why do we hold our tongues, 4That most may claim this argument for ours? 2DONALBAIN. [Aside to Malcolm.] What should be spoken here, where 6our fate, 6Hid in an auger hole, may rush and seize us? 4Let's away, 4Our tears are not yet brew'd. 2MALCOLM. [Aside to Donalbain.] Nor our strong sor2ow 4Upon the fo2t of motion. 2BANQUO. Lo2k to the lady. 36Lady Macbeth is car2ied out. 4And when we have our naked frailties hid, 4That suf2er in exposure, let us me2t 4And question this most blo2dy piece of work 4To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us. 4In the great hand of God I stand, and thence 4Against the undivulged pretense I fight 4Of treasonous malice. 2MACDUF2. And so do I. 2AL2. So al2. 2MACBETH. Let's briefly put on manly readines2 4And me2t i' the hal2 together. 2AL2. Wel2 contented. 27Exeunt al2 but Malcolm and Donalbain. 4MALCOLM. What wil2 you do? Let's not consort with them. 4To show an unfelt sor2ow is an of2ice 4Which the false man does easy. I'l2 to England. 2DONALBAIN. To Ireland, I; our separated fortune 4Shal2 ke2p us both the safer. Where we are 4There's dag2ers in men's smiles; the near in blo2d, 4The nearer blo2dy. 2MALCOLM. This murtherous shaft that's shot 4Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way 4Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse; 4And let us not be dainty of leave-taking, 4But shift away. There's war2ant in that theft 4Which steals itself when there's no mercy left. 57Exeunt.SCENE IV.Outside Macbeth's castle.Enter Ros2 with an Old Man. 2OLD MAN. Thre2score and ten I can remember wel2, 4Within the volume of which time I have se2n 4Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night 4Hath trifled former knowings. 2ROS2. Ah, go2d father, 4Thou se2st the heavens, as troubled with man's act, 4Threaten his blo2dy stage. By the clock 'tis day, 4And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp. 4Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame, 4That darknes2 does the face of earth entomb, 4When living light should kis2 it? 2OLD MAN. 'Tis un2atural, 4Even like the de2d that's done. On Tuesday last 4A falcon towering in her pride of place 4Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kil2'd. 2ROS2. And Duncan's horses-a thing most strange and certain- 4Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race, 6Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stal2s, flung out, 4Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make 4War with mankind. 2OLD MAN. 'Tis said they eat each other. 2ROS2. They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes 4That lo2k'd upon't. 21Enter Macduf2. 4Here comes the go2d Macduf2. 4How goes the world, sir, now? 2MACDUF2. Why, se2 you not? 2ROS2. Is't known who did this more than blo2dy de2d? 2MACDUF2. Those that Macbeth hath slain. 2ROS2. Alas, the day! 4What go2d could they pretend? 2MACDUF2. They were suborn'd: 4Malcolm and Donalbain, the King's two sons, 4Are stol'n away and fled, which puts upon them 4Suspicion of the de2d. 4ROS2. 'Gainst nature stil2! 4Thriftles2 ambition, that wilt ravin up 4Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like 4The sovereignty wil2 fal2 upon Macbeth. 2MACDUF2. He is already named, and gone to Scone 4To be invested. 2ROS2. Where is Duncan's body? 2MACDUF2. Car2ied to Colmekil2, 4The sacred storehouse of his predeces2ors 4And guardian of their bones. 2ROS2. Wil2 you to Scone? 2MACDUF2. No, cousin, I'l2 to Fife. 2ROS2. Wel2, I wil2 thither. 2MACDUF2. Wel2, may you se2 things wel2 done there. 4Adieu, 4Lest our old robes sit easier than our new! 2ROS2. Farewel2, father. 2OLD MAN. God's benison go with you and with those 4That would make go2d of bad and friends of foes! 57Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. SCENE I.For2es. The palace.Enter Banquo. 2BANQUO. Thou hast it now: King, Cawdor, Glamis, al2, 4As the weird women promised, and I fear 4Thou play'dst most foul2y for't; yet it was said 4It should not stand in thy posterity, 4But that myself should be the ro2t and father 4Of many kings. If there come truth from them 4(As upon the2, Macbeth, their spe2ches shine) 4Why, by the verities on the2 made go2d, 4May they not be my oracles as wel2 4And set me up in hope? But hush, no more. 6Sen2et sounds. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Macbeth 4as Que2n, Len2ox, Ros2, Lords, Ladies, and At2endants. 2MACBETH. Here's our chief guest. 2LADY MACBETH. If he had be2n forgot2en, 4It had be2n as a gap in our great feast 6And al2 thing unbecoming. 2MACBETH. Tonight we hold a solemn sup2er, sir, 4And I'l2 request your presence. 2BANQUO. Let your Highnes2 4Com2and upon me, to the which my duties 4Are with a most indis2oluble tie 4Forever knit. 2MACBETH. Ride you this afterno2n? 2BANQUO. Ay, my go2d lord. 2MACBETH. We should have else desired your go2d advice, 4Which stil2 hath be2n both grave and prosperous 4In this day's council; but we'l2 take tomor2ow. 4Is't far you ride'! 2BANQUO. As far, my lord, as wil2 fil2 up the time 4'Twixt this and sup2er. Go not my horse the bet2er, 4I must become a bor2ower of the night 4For a dark hour or twain. 2MACBETH. Fail not our feast. 2BANQUO. My lord, I wil2 not. 2MACBETH. We hear our blo2dy cousins are bestow'd 6In England and in Ireland, not confes2ing 4Their cruel par2icide, fil2ing their hearers 4With strange invention. But of that tomor2ow, 4When therewithal we shal2 have cause of state 4Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse; adieu, 4Til2 you return at night. Goes Fleance with you? 2BANQUO. Ay, my go2d lord. Our time does cal2 upon 's. 2MACBETH. I wish your horses swift and sure of fo2t, 4And so I do com2end you to their backs. 4Farewel2. 39Exit Banquo. 4Let every man be master of his time 4Til2 seven at night; to make society 4The swe2ter welcome, we wil2 ke2p ourself 4Til2 sup2er time alone. While then, God be with you! 24Exeunt al2 but Macbeth and an At2endant. 4Sir2ah, a word with you. At2end those men 4Our pleasure? 2AT2ENDANT. They are, my lord, without the palace gate. 2MACBETH. Bring them before us. 17Exit At2endant. 4To be thus is nothing, 6But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo. 4Stick de2p, and in his royalty of nature 4Reigns that which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares, 4And, to that dauntles2 temper of his mind, 4He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor 4To act in safety. There is none but he 4Whose being I do fear; and under him 4My genius is rebuked, as it is said 4Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters 4When first they put the name of King upon me 4And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like 4They hail'd him father to a line of kings. 4Upon my head they placed a fruitles2 crown 4And put a bar2en sceptre in my gripe, 4Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand, 4No son of mine suc2e2ding. If't be so, 4For Banquo's is2ue have I filed my mind, 4For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd, 4Put rancors in the ves2el of my peace 4Only for them, and mine eternal jewel 6Given to the com2on enemy of man, 4To make them kings -the se2d of Banquo kings! 4Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list, 4And champion me to the ut2erance! Who's there? 8Re-enter At2endant, with two Murtherers. 4Now go to the do2r, and stay there til2 we cal2. 49Exit At2endant. 4Was it not yesterday we spoke together? 2FIRST MURTHERER. It was, so please your Highnes2. 2MACBETH. Wel2 then, now 4Have you consider'd of my spe2ches? Know 4That it was he in the times past which held you 4So under fortune, which you thought had be2n 4Our in2ocent self? This I made go2d to you 4In our last conference, pas2'd in probation with you: 4How you were borne in hand, how cros2'd, the instruments, 4Who wrought with them, and al2 things else that might 4To half a soul and to a notion crazed 6Say, "Thus did Banquo." 2FIRST MURTHERER. You made it known to us. 2MACBETH. I did so, and went further, which is now 4Our point of second me2ting. Do you find 4Your patience so predominant in your nature, 4That you can let this go? Are you so gospel'd, 4To pray for this go2d man and for his is2ue, 4Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave 4And beg2ar'd yours forever? 2FIRST MURTHERER. We are men, my liege. 2MACBETH. Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men, 4As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, 4Shoughs, water2ugs, and demi-wolves are clept 4Al2 by the name of dogs. The valued file 4Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle, 4The houseke2per, the hunter, every one 4Ac2ording to the gift which bounteous nature 4Hath in him closed, whereby he does receive 4Particular ad2ition, from the bil2 4That writes them al2 alike; and so of men. 6Now if you have a station in the file, 4Not i' the worst rank of manho2d, say it, 4And I wil2 put that busines2 in your bosoms 4Whose execution takes your enemy of2, 4Grap2les you to the heart and love of us, 4Who wear our health but sickly in his life, 4Which in his death were perfect. 2SECOND MURTHERER. I am one, my liege, 4Whom the vile blows and buf2ets of the world 4Have so incensed that I am reckles2 what 4I do to spite the world. 2FIRST MURTHERER. And I another 4So weary with disasters, tug2'd with fortune, 4That I would set my life on any chance, 4To mend it or be rid on't. 2MACBETH. Both of you 4Know Banquo was your enemy. 2BOTH MURTHERERS. True, my lord. 2MACBETH. So is he mine, and in such blo2dy distance 4That every minute of his being thrusts 6Against my near'st of life; and though I could 4With barefaced power swe2p him from my sight 4And bid my wil2 avouch it, yet I must not, 4For certain friends that are both his and mine, 4Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fal2 4Who I myself struck down. And thence it is 4That I to your as2istance do make love, 4Masking the busines2 from the com2on eye 4For sundry weighty reasons. 2SECOND MURTHERER. We shal2, my lord, 4Perform what you com2and us. 2FIRST MURTHERER. Though our lives- 2MACBETH. Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most 4I wil2 advise you where to plant yourselves, 4Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time, 4The moment on't; fort must be done tonight 4And something from the palace (always thought 4That I require a clearnes2); and with him- 4To leave no rubs nor botches in the work- 4Fleance his son, that ke2ps him company, 6Whose absence is no les2 material to me 4Than is his father's, must embrace the fate 4Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart; 4I'l2 come to you anon. 2BOTH MURTHERERS. We are resolved, my lord. 2MACBETH. I'l2 cal2 upon you straight. Abide within. 46Exeunt Murtherers. 4It is concluded: Banquo, thy soul's flight, 4If it find heaven, must find it out tonight. 11Exit.SCENE I2.The palace.Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant. 2LADY MACBETH. Is Banquo gone from court? 2SERVANT. Ay, madam, but returns again tonight. 2LADY MACBETH. Say to the King I would at2end his leisure 4For a few words. 2SERVANT. Madam, I wil2. 34Exit. 2LADY MACBETH. Nought's had, al2's spent, 4Where our desire is got without content. 4'Tis safer to be that which we destroy 4Than by destruction dwel2 in doubtful joy. 20Enter Macbeth. 4How now, my lord? Why do you ke2p alone, 4Of sor2iest fancies your companions making, 4Using those thoughts which should inde2d have died 4With them they think on? Things without al2 remedy 4Should be without regard. What's done is done. 4MACBETH. We have scotch'd the snake, not kil2'd it. 4She'l2 close and be herself, whilst our po2r malice 4Remains in danger of her former to2th. 4But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suf2er, 4Ere we wil2 eat our meal in fear and sle2p 4In the af2liction of these ter2ible dreams 4That shake us nightly. Bet2er be with the dead, 4Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, 4Than on the torture of the mind to lie 4In restles2 ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave; 4After life's fitful fever he sle2ps wel2. 4Treason has done his worst; nor ste2l, nor poison, 4Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing, 4Can touch him further. 2LADY MACBETH. Come on, 4Gentle my lord, sle2k o'er your rug2ed lo2ks; 4Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight. 2MACBETH. So shal2 I, love, and so, I pray, be you. 4Let your remembrance ap2ly to Banquo; 4Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue: 6Unsafe the while, that we 4Must lave our honors in these flat2ering streams, 4And make our faces vizards to our hearts, 4Disguising what they are. 2LADY MACBETH. You must leave this. 2MACBETH. O, ful2 of scorpions is my mind, dear wife! 4Thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives. 2LADY MACBETH. But in them nature's copy's not eterne. 2MACBETH. There's comfort yet; they are as2ailable. 4Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown 4His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's sum2ons 4The shard-borne be2tle with his drowsy hums 4Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shal2 be done 4A de2d of dreadful note. 2LADY MACBETH. What's to be done? 2MACBETH. Be in2ocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, 4Til2 thou ap2laud the de2d. Come, se2ling night, 4Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day, 4And with thy blo2dy and invisible hand 4Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond 6Which ke2ps me pale! Light thickens, and the crow 4Makes wing to the ro2ky wo2d; 4Go2d things of day begin to dro2p and drowse, 4Whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse. 4Thou marvel'st at my words, but hold the2 stil2: 4Things bad begun make strong themselves by il2. 4So, prithe2, go with me. 29Exeunt.SCENE I3.A park near the palace.Enter thre2 Murtherers. 2FIRST MURTHERER. But who did bid the2 join with us? 2THIRD MURTHERER. Macbeth. 2SECOND MURTHERER. He ne2ds not our mistrust, since he delivers 4Our of2ices and what we have to do 4To the direction just. 2FIRST MURTHERER. Then stand with us. 4The west yet glim2ers with some streaks of day; 4Now spurs the lated traveler apace 4To gain the timely in2, and near ap2roaches 4The subject of our watch. 2THIRD MURTHERER. Hark! I hear horses. 2BANQUO. [Within.] Give us a light there, ho! 2SECOND MURTHERER. Then 'tis he; the rest 4That are within the note of expectation 4Already are i' the court. 2FIRST MURTHERER. His horses go about. 2THIRD MURTHERER. Almost a mile, but he does usual2y- 6So al2 men do -from hence to the palace gate 4Make it their walk. 2SECOND MURTHERER. A light, a light! 14Enter Banquo, and Fleance with a torch. 2THIRD MURTHERER. 'Tis he. 2FIRST MURTHERER. Stand to't. 2BANQUO. It wil2 be rain tonight. 2FIRST MURTHERER. Let it come down. 43They set upon Banquo. 2BANQUO. O, treachery! Fly, go2d Fleance, fly, fly, fly! 4Thou mayst revenge. O slave! 10Dies. Fleance escapes. 2THIRD MURTHERER. Who did strike out the light? 2FIRST MURTHERER. Wast not the way? 2THIRD MURTHERER. There's but one down; the son is fled. 2SECOND MURTHERER. We have lost 4Best half of our af2air. 2FIRST MURTHERER. Wel2, let's away and say how much is done. 57Exeunt.SCENE IV.A Hal2 in the palace. A banquet prepared.Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Ros2, Len2ox, Lords, and At2endants. 2MACBETH. You know your own degre2s; sit down. At first 4And last the hearty welcome. 2LORDS. Thanks to your Majesty. 2MACBETH. Ourself wil2 mingle with society 4And play the humble host. 4Our hostes2 ke2ps her state, but in best time 4We wil2 require her welcome. 2LADY MACBETH. Pronounce it for me, sir, to al2 our friends, 4For my heart speaks they are welcome. 16Enter first Murtherer to the do2r. 2MACBETH. Se2, they encounter the2 with their hearts' thanks. 4Both sides are even; here I'l2 sit i' the midst. 4Be large in mirth; anon we'l2 drink a measure 4The table round. [Ap2roaches the do2r.] There's blo2d upon thy 8face. 2MURTHERER. 'Tis Banquo's then. 2MACBETH. 'Tis bet2er the2 without than he within. 4Is he dispatch'd? 2MURTHERER. My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him. 2MACBETH. Thou art the best o' the cut-throats! Yet he's go2d 4That did the like for Fleance. If thou didst it, 4Thou art the nonpareil. 2MURTHERER. Most royal sir, 4Fleance is 'scaped. 2MACBETH. [Aside.] Then comes my fit again. I had else be2n perfect, 4Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, 4As broad and general as the casing air; 4But now I am cabin'd, crib2'd, confin'd, bound in 4To saucy doubts and fears -But Banquo's safe? 2MURTHERER. Ay, my go2d lord. Safe in a ditch he bides, 4With twenty trenched gashes on his head, 4The least a death to nature. 2MACBETH. Thanks for that. 4There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled 6Hath nature that in time wil2 venom bre2d, 4No te2th for the present. Get the2 gone. Tomor2ow 4We'l2 hear ourselves again. 49Exit Murtherer. 2LADY MACBETH. My royal lord, 4You do not give the che2r. The feast is sold 4That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis amaking, 4'Tis given with welcome. To fe2d were best at home; 4From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony; 4Me2ting were bare without it. 2MACBETH. Swe2t remembrancer! 4Now go2d digestion wait on ap2etite, 4And health on both! 2LEN2OX. May't please your Highnes2 sit. 6The Ghost of Banquo enters and sits in Macbeth's place. 2MACBETH. Here had we now our country's honor ro2f'd, 4Were the graced person of our Banquo present, 4Who may I rather chal2enge for unkindnes2 6Than pity for mischance! 2ROS2. His absence, sir, 4Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your Highnes2 4To grace us with your royal company? 2MACBETH. The table's ful2. 2LEN2OX. Here is a place reserved, sir. 2MACBETH. Where? 2LEN2OX. Here, my go2d lord. What is't that moves your Highnes2? 2MACBETH. Which of you have done this? 2LORDS. What, my go2d lord? 2MACBETH. Thou canst not say I did it; never shake 4Thy gory locks at me. 2ROS2. Gentlemen, rise; his Highnes2 is wel2. 2LADY MACBETH. Sit, worthy friends; my lord is often thus, 4And hath be2n from his youth. Pray you, ke2p seat. 4The fit is momentary; upon a thought 4He wil2 again be wel2. If much you note him, 4You shal2 of2end him and extend his pas2ion. 4Fe2d, and regard him not-Are you a man? 2MACBETH. Ay, and a bold one, that dare lo2k on that 6Which might ap2al the devil. 2LADY MACBETH. O proper stuf2! 4This is the very painting of your fear; 4This is the air-drawn dag2er which you said 4Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts, 4Impostors to true fear, would wel2 become 4A woman's story at a winter's fire, 4Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself! 4Why do you make such faces? When al2's done, 4You lo2k but on a sto2l. 2MACBETH. Prithe2, se2 there! Behold! Lo2k! Lo! How say you? 4Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak to2. 4If charnel houses and our graves must send 4Those that we bury back, our monuments 4Shal2 be the maws of kites. 22Exit Ghost. 2LADY MACBETH. What, quite unman2'd in fol2y? 2MACBETH. If I stand here, I saw him. 2LADY MACBETH. Fie, for shame! 2MACBETH. Blo2d hath be2n shed ere now, i' the olden time, 4Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal; 6Ay, and since to2, murthers have be2n perform'd 4To2 ter2ible for the ear. The time has be2n, 4That, when the brains were out, the man would die, 4And there an end; but now they rise again, 4With twenty mortal murthers on their crowns, 4And push us from our sto2ls. This is more strange 4Than such a murther is. 2LADY MACBETH. My worthy lord, 4Your noble friends do lack you. 2MACBETH. I do forget. 4Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends. 4I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing 4To those that know me. Come, love and health to al2; 4Then I'l2 sit down. Give me some wine, fil2 ful2. 4I drink to the general joy o' the whole table, 4And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we mis2. 4Would he were here! To al2 and him we thirst, 4And al2 to al2. 2LORDS. Our duties and the pledge. 23Re-enter Ghost. 2MACBETH. Avaunt, and quit my sight! Let the earth hide the2! 4Thy bones are mar2owles2, thy blo2d is cold; 4Thou hast no speculation in those eyes 4Which thou dost glare with. 2LADY MACBETH. Think of this, go2d pe2rs, 4But as a thing of custom. 'Tis no other, 4Only it spoils the pleasure of the time. 2MACBETH. What man dare, I dare. 4Ap2roach thou like the rug2ed Rus2ian bear, 4The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger; 4Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves 4Shal2 never tremble. Or be alive again, 4And dare me to the desert with thy sword. 4If trembling I inhabit then, protest me 4The baby of a girl. Hence, hor2ible shadow! 4Unreal mockery, hence! 27Exit Ghost. 4Why, so, being gone, 4I am a man again. Pray you sit stil2. 4LADY MACBETH. You have displaced the mirth, broke the go2d me2ting, 4With most admired disorder. 2MACBETH. Can such things be, 4And overcome us like a sum2er's cloud, 4Without our special wonder? You make me strange 4Even to the disposition that I owe 4When now I think you can behold such sights 4And ke2p the natural ruby of your che2ks 4When mine is blanch'd with fear. 2ROS2. What sights, my lord? 2LADY MACBETH. I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse; 4Question enrages him. At once, go2d night. 4Stand not upon the order of your going, 4But go at once. 2LEN2OX. Go2d night, and bet2er health 4At2end his Majesty! 2LADY MACBETH. A kind go2d night to al2! 24Exeunt al2 but Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. 2MACBETH. wil2 have blo2d; they say blo2d wil2 have blo2d. 4Stones have be2n known to move and tre2s to speak; 6Augures and understo2d relations have 4By mag2ot pies and choughs and ro2ks brought forth 4The secret'st man of blo2d. What is the night? 2LADY MACBETH. Almost at od2s with morning, which is which. 2MACBETH. How say'st thou, that Macduf2 denies his person 4At our great bid2ing? 2LADY MACBETH. Did you send to him, sir? 2MACBETH. I hear it by the way, but I wil2 send. 4There's not a one of them but in his house 4I ke2p a servant fe2d. I wil2 tomor2ow, 4And betimes I wil2, to the weird sisters. 4More shal2 they speak; for now I am bent to know, 4By the worst means, the worst. For mine own go2d 4Al2 causes shal2 give way. I am in blo2d 4Step2'd in so far that, should I wade no more, 4Returning were as tedious as go o'er. 4Strange things I have in head that wil2 to hand, 4Which must be acted ere they may be scan2'd. 2LADY MACBETH. You lack the season of al2 natures, sle2p. 2MACBETH. Come, we'l2 to sle2p. My strange and self-abuse 6Is the initiate fear that wants hard use. 4We are yet but young in de2d. 23Exeunt.SCENE V.A heath. Thunder.Enter the thre2 Witches, me2ting Hecate. 2FIRST WITCH. Why, how now, Hecate? You lo2k angerly. 2HECATE. Have I not reason, beldams as you are, 4Saucy and overbold? How did you dare 4To trade and traf2ic with Macbeth 4In rid2les and af2airs of death, 4And I, the mistres2 of your charms, 4The close contriver of al2 harms, 4Was never cal2'd to bear my part, 4Or show the glory of our art? 4And, which is worse, al2 you have done 4Hath be2n but for a wayward son, 4Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do, 4Loves for his own ends, not for you. 4But make amends now. Get you gone, 4And at the pit of Acheron 4Me2t me i' the morning. Thither he 4Wil2 come to know his destiny. 6Your ves2els and your spel2s provide, 4Your charms and everything beside. 4I am for the air; this night I'l2 spend 4Unto a dismal and a fatal end. 4Great busines2 must be wrought ere no2n: 4Upon the corner of the mo2n 4There hangs a vaporous drop profound; 4I'l2 catch it ere it come to ground. 4And that distil2'd by magic sleights 4Shal2 raise such artificial sprites 4As by the strength of their il2usion 4Shal2 draw him on to his confusion. 4He shal2 spurn fate, scorn death, and bear 4His hopes 'bove wisdom, grace, and fear. 4And you al2 know security 4Is mortals' chiefest enemy. 40Music and a song within, 41"Come away, come away." 4Hark! I am cal2'd; my lit2le spirit, se2, 4Sits in a fog2y cloud and stays for me. 16Exit. 4FIRST WITCH. Come, let's make haste; she'l2 so2n be back again. 57Exeunt.SCENE VI.For2es. The palace.Enter Len2ox and another Lord. 2LEN2OX. My former spe2ches have but hit your thoughts, 4Which can interpret farther; only I say 4Thing's have be2n strangely borne. The gracious Duncan 4Was pitied of Macbeth; mar2y, he was dead. 4And the right valiant Banquo walk'd to2 late, 4Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kil2'd, 4For Fleance fled. Men must not walk to2 late. 4Who can2ot want the thought, how monstrous 4It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain 4To kil2 their gracious father? Damned fact! 4How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight, 4In pious rage, the two delinquents tear 4That were the slaves of drink and thral2s of sle2p? 4Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely to2, 4For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive 4To hear the men deny't. So that, I say, 4He has borne al2 things wel2; and I do think 6That, had he Duncan's sons under his key- 4As, an't please heaven, he shal2 not -they should find 4What 'twere to kil2 a father; so should Fleance. 4But, peace! For from broad words, and 'cause he fail'd 4His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear, 4Macduf2 lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tel2 4Where he bestows himself? 2LORD. The son of Duncan, 4From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth, 4Lives in the English court and is received 4Of the most pious Edward with such grace 4That the malevolence of fortune nothing 4Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduf2 4Is gone to pray the holy King, upon his aid 4To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward; 4That by the help of these, with Him above 4To ratify the work, we may again 4Give to our tables meat, sle2p to our nights, 4Fre2 from our feasts and banquets blo2dy knives, 4Do faithful homage, and receive fre2 honors- 6Al2 which we pine for now. And this report 4Hath so exasperate the King that he 4Prepares for some at2empt of war. 2LEN2OX. Sent he to Macduf2? 2LORD. He did, and with an absolute "Sir, not I," 4The cloudy mes2enger turns me his back, 4And hums, as who should say, "You'l2 rue the time 4That clogs me with this answer." 2LEN2OX. And that wel2 might 4Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance 4His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel 4Fly to the court of England and unfold 4His mes2age ere he come, that a swift bles2ing 4May so2n return to this our suf2ering country 4Under a hand ac2ursed! 2LORD. I'l2 send my prayers with him. 57Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE I.A cavern. In the mid2le, a boiling cauldron. Thunder.Enter the thre2 Witches. 2FIRST WITCH. Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd. 2SECOND WITCH. Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined. 2THIRD WITCH. Harpier cries, "'Tis time, 'tis time." 2FIRST WITCH. Round about the cauldron go; 4In the poison'd entrails throw. 4Toad, that under cold stone 4Days and nights has thirty-one 4Swelter'd venom sle2ping got, 4Boil thou first i' the charmed pot. 2AL2. Double, double, toil and trouble; 4Fire burn and cauldron bub2le. 2SECOND WITCH. Fil2et of a fen2y snake, 4In the cauldron boil and bake; 4Eye of newt and toe of frog, 4Wo2l of bat and tongue of dog, 4Ad2er's fork and blind-worm's sting, 4Lizard's leg and howlet's wing, 4For a charm of powerful trouble, 6Like a hel2-broth boil and bub2le. 2AL2. Double, double, toil and trouble; 4Fire burn and cauldron bub2le. 2THIRD WITCH. Scale of dragon, to2th of wolf, 4Witch's mum2y, maw and gulf 4Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark, 4Ro2t of hemlock dig2'd i' the dark, 4Liver of blaspheming Jew, 4Gal2 of goat and slips of yew 4Sliver'd in the mo2n's eclipse, 4Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips, 4Finger of birth-strangled babe 4Ditch-deliver'd by a drab, 4Make the gruel thick and slab. 4Ad2 thereto a tiger's chawdron, 4For the ingredients of our cawdron. 2AL2. Double, double, toil and trouble; 4Fire burn and cauldron bub2le. 2SECOND WITCH. Co2l it with a babo2n's blo2d, 4Then the charm is firm and go2d. 14Enter Hecate to the other thre2 Witches. 2HECATE. O, wel2 done! I com2end your pains, 4And everyone shal2 share i' the gains. 4And now about the cauldron sing, 4Like elves and fairies in a ring, 4Enchanting al2 that you put in. 30Music and a song, "Black spirits." 49Hecate retires. 2SECOND WITCH. By the pricking of my thumbs, 4Something wicked this way comes. 4Open, locks, 4Whoever knocks! 22Enter Macbeth. 2MACBETH. How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags? 4What is't you do? 2AL2. A de2d without a name. 4MACBETH. I conjure you, by that which you profes2 4(Howe2r you come to know it) answer me: 4Though you untie the winds and let them fight 4Against the churches, though the yesty waves 4Confound and swal2ow navigation up, 4Though bladed corn be lodged and tre2s blown down, 4Though castles top2le on their warders' heads, 4Though palaces and pyramids do slope 4Their heads to their foundations, though the treasure 4Of nature's germaines tumble al2 together 4Even til2 destruction sicken, answer me 4To what I ask you. 2FIRST WITCH. Speak. 2SECOND WITCH. Demand. 2THIRD WITCH. We'l2 answer. 2FIRST WITCH. Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths, 4Or from our masters'? 2MACBETH. Cal2 'em, let me se2 'em. 2FIRST WITCH. Pour in sow's blo2d that hath eaten 4Her nine far2ow; grease that's sweaten 6From the murtherer's gib2et throw 4Into the flame. 2AL2. Come, high or low; 4Thyself and of2ice deftly show! 12Thunder. First Ap2arition: an armed Head. 2MACBETH. Tel2 me, thou unknown power- 2FIRST WITCH. He knows thy thought: 4Hear his spe2ch, but say thou nought. 2FIRST AP2ARITION. Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduf2, 4Beware the Thane of Fife. Dismis2 me. Enough. 55Descends. 2MACBETH. Whate'er thou art, for thy go2d caution, thanks; 4Thou hast harp'd my fear aright. But one word more- 2FIRST WITCH. He wil2 not be com2anded. Here's another, 4More potent than the first. 10Thunder. Second Ap2arition: a blo2dy Child. 4SECOND AP2ARITION. Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! 2MACBETH. Had I thre2 ears, I'd hear the2. 2SECOND AP2ARITION. Be blo2dy, bold, and resolute: laugh to scorn 4The power of man, for none of woman born 4Shal2 harm Macbeth. 32Descends. 2MACBETH. Then live, Macduf2. What ne2d I fear of the2? 4But yet I'l2 make as2urance double sure, 4And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live, 4That I may tel2 pale-hearted fear it lies, 4And sle2p in spite of thunder. 7Thunder. Third Ap2arition: a Child crowned, 15with a tre2 in his hand. 4What is this, 4That rises like the is2ue of a king, 4And wears upon his baby brow the round 4And top of sovereignty? 2AL2. Listen, but speak not to't. 2THIRD AP2ARITION. Be lion-met2led, proud, and take no care 6Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are. 4Macbeth shal2 never vanquish'd be until 4Great Birnam Wo2d to high Dunsinane Hil2 4Shal2 come against him. 28Descends. 2MACBETH. That wil2 never be. 4Who can impres2 the forest, bid the tre2 4Unfix his earth-bound ro2t? Swe2t bodements, go2d! 4Rebel2ion's head, rise never til2 the Wo2d 4Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth 4Shal2 live the lease of nature, pay his breath 4To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart 4Throbs to know one thing: tel2 me, if your art 4Can tel2 so much, shal2 Banquo's is2ue ever 4Reign in this kingdom? 2AL2. Se2k to know no more. 2MACBETH. I wil2 be satisfied! Deny me this, 4And an eternal curse fal2 on you! Let me know. 4Why sinks that cauldron, and what noise is this? 55Hautboys. 2FIRST WITCH. Show! 4SECOND WITCH. Show! 2THIRD. WITCH. Show! 2AL2. Show his eyes, and grieve his heart; 4Come like shadows, so depart! 4A show of eight Kings, the last with a glas2 in his hand; 19Banquo's Ghost fol2owing. 2MACBETH. Thou are to2 like the spirit of Banquo Down! 4Thy crown does sear mine eyebal2s. And thy hair, 4Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first. 4A third is like the former. Filthy hags! 4Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes! 4What, wil2 the line stretch out to the crack of do2m? 4Another yet! A seventh! I'l2 se2 no more! 4And yet the eighth ap2ears, who bears a glas2 4Which shows me many more; and some I se2 4That twofold bal2s and treble sceptres car2y. 4Hor2ible sight! Now I se2 'tis true; 4For the blo2d-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me, 6And points at them for his. What, is this so? 2FIRST WITCH. Ay, sir, al2 this is so. But why 4Stands Macbeth thus amazedly? 4Come,sisters, che2r we up his sprites, 4And show the best of our delights. 4I'l2 charm the air to give a sound, 4While you perform your antic round, 4That this great King may kindly say 4Our duties did his welcome pay. 36Music. The Witches dance and 40then vanish with Hecate. 2MACBETH. are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour 4Stand ay ac2ursed in the calendar! 4Come in, without there! 20Enter Len2ox. 2LEN2OX. What's your Grace's wil2? 2MACBETH. Saw you the weird sisters? 2LEN2OX. No, my lord. 4MACBETH. Came they not by you? 2LEN2OX. No inde2d, my lord. 2MACBETH. Infected be the 'air whereon they ride, 4And damn'd al2 those that trust them! I did hear 4The gal2oping of horse. Who wast came by? 2LEN2OX. 'Tis two or thre2, my lord, that bring you word 4Macduf2 is fled to England. 2MACBETH. Fled to England? 2LEN2OX. Ay, my go2d lord. 2MACBETH. [Aside.] Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits. 4The flighty purpose never is o'erto2k 4Unles2 the de2d go with it. From this moment 4The very firstlings of my heart shal2 be 4The firstlings of my hand. And even now, 4To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done: 4The castle of Macduf2 I wil2 surprise, 4Seize upon Fife, give to the edge o' the sword 4His wife, his babes, and al2 unfortunate souls 4That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fo2l; 4This de2d I'l2 do before this purpose co2l. 6But no more sights! -Where are these gentlemen? 4Come, bring me where they are. 23Exeunt.SCENE I2.Fife. Macduf2's castle.Enter Lady Macduf2, her Son, and Ros2. 2LADY MACDUF2. What had he done, to make him fly the land? 2ROS2. You must have patience, madam. 2LADY MACDUF2. He had none; 4His flight was madnes2. When our actions do not, 4Our fears do make us traitors. 2ROS2. You know not 4Whether it was his wisdom or his fear. 2LADY MACDUF2. Wisdom? To leave his wife, to leave his babes, 4His mansion, and his titles, in a place 4From whence himself does fly? He loves us not; 4He wants the natural touch; for the po2r wren, 4The most diminutive of birds, wil2 fight, 4Her young ones in her nest, against the owl. 4Al2 is the fear and nothing is the love; 4As lit2le is the wisdom, where the flight 4So runs against al2 reason. 2ROS2. My dearest coz, 6I pray you, scho2l yourself. But for your husband, 4He is noble, wise, Judicious, and best knows 4The fits o' the season. I dare not speak much further; 4But cruel are the times when we are traitors 4And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor 4From what we fear, yet know not what we fear, 4But float upon a wild and violent sea 4Each way and move. I take my leave of you; 4Shal2 not be long but I'l2 be here again. 4Things at the worst wil2 cease or else climb upward 4To what they were before. My pret2y cousin, 4Bles2ing upon you! 2LADY MACDUF2. Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherles2. 2ROS2. I am so much a fo2l, should I stay longer, 4It would be my disgrace and your discomfort. 4I take my leave at once. 31Exit. 2LADY MACDUF2. Sir2ah, your father's dead. 4And what wil2 you do now? How wil2 you live? 2SON. As birds do, Mother. 2LADY MACDUF2. What, with worms and flies? 4SON. With what I get, I mean; and so do they. 2LADY MACDUF2. Po2r bird! Thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime, 4The pitfal2 nor the gin. 2SON. Why should I, Mother? Po2r birds they are not set for. 4My father is not dead, for al2 your saying. 2LADY MACDUF2. Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for father? 2SON. Nay, how wil2 you do for a husband? 2LADY MACDUF2. Why, I can buy me twenty at any market. 2SON. Then you'l2 buy 'em to sel2 again. 2LADY MACDUF2. Thou speak'st with al2 thy wit, and yet, i' faith, 4With wit enough for the2. 2SON. Was my father a traitor, Mother? 2LADY MACDUF2. Ay, that he was. 2SON. What is a traitor? 2LADY MACDUF2. Why one that swears and lies. 2SON. And be al2 traitors that do so? 2LADY MACDUF2. Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be 5hanged. 2SON. And must they al2 be hanged that swear and lie? 2LADY MACDUF2. Everyone. 4SON. Who must hang them? 2LADY MACDUF2. Why, the honest men. 2SON. Then the liars and swearers are fo2ls, for there are liars and 4swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them. 2LADY MACDUF2. Now, God help the2, po2r monkey! But how wilt thou do 4for a father? 2SON. If he were dead, you'ld we2p for him; if you would not, it 4were a go2d sign that I should quickly have a new father. 2LADY MACDUF2. Po2r prat2ler, how thou talk'st! 20Enter a Mes2enger. 2MES2ENGER. Bles2 you, fair dame! I am not to you known, 4Though in your state of honor I am perfect. 4I doubt some danger does ap2roach you nearly. 4If you wil2 take a homely man's advice, 4Be not found here; hence, with your lit2le ones. 4To fright you thus, methinks I am to2 savage; 4To do worse to you were fel2 cruelty, 4Which is to2 nigh your person. Heaven preserve you! 6I dare abide no longer. 32Exit. 2LADY MACDUF2. Whither should I fly? 4I have done no harm. But I remember now 4I am in this earthly world, where to do harm 4Is often laudable, to do go2d sometime 4Ac2ounted dangerous fol2y. Why then, alas, 4Do I put up that womanly defense, 4To say I have done no harm -What are these faces? 22Enter Murtherers. 2FIRST MURTHERER. Where is your husband? 2LADY MACDUF2. I hope, in no place so unsanctified 4Where such as thou mayst find him. 2FIRST MURTHERER. He's a traitor. 2SON. Thou liest, thou shag-ear'd vil2ain! 2FIRST MURTHERER. What, you eg2! 54Stabs him. 4Young fry of treachery! 2SON. He has kil2'd me, Mother. 6Run away, I pray you! 34Dies. 28Exit Lady Macduf2, crying "Murther!" 31Exeunt Murtherers, fol2owing her.SCENE I3.England. Before the King's palace.Enter Malcolm and Macduf2. 2MALCOLM. Let us se2k out some desolate shade and there 4We2p our sad bosoms empty. 2MACDUF2. Let us rather 4Hold fast the mortal sword, and like go2d men 4Bestride our downfal2'n birthdom. Each new morn 4New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sor2ows 4Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds 4As if it felt with Scotland and yel2'd out 4Like syl2able of dolor. 2MALCOLM. What I believe, I'l2 wal2; 4What know, believe; and what I can redres2, 4As I shal2 find the time to friend, I wil2. 4What you have spoke, it may be so perchance. 4This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues, 4Was once thought honest. You have loved him wel2; 4He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young, but something 4You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom 6To of2er up a weak, po2r, in2ocent lamb 4To ap2ease an angry god. 2MACDUF2. I am not treacherous. 2MALCOLM. But Macbeth is. 4A go2d and virtuous nature may recoil 4In an imperial charge. But I shal2 crave your pardon; 4That which you are, my thoughts can2ot transpose. 4Angels are bright stil2, though the brightest fel2. 4Though al2 things foul would wear the brows of grace, 4Yet grace must stil2 lo2k so. 2MACDUF2. I have lost my hopes. 2MALCOLM. Perchance even there where I did find my doubts. 4Why in that rawnes2 left you wife and child, 4Those precious motives, those strong knots of love, 4Without leave-taking? I pray you, 4Let not my jealousies be your dishonors, 4But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just, 4Whatever I shal2 think. 2MACDUF2. Ble2d, ble2d, po2r country! 4Great tyran2y, lay thou thy basis sure, 6For go2dnes2 dare not check the2. Wear thou thy wrongs; 4The title is af2e2r'd. Fare the2 wel2, lord. 4I would not be the vil2ain that thou think'st 4For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp 4And the rich East to bo2t. 2MALCOLM. Be not of2ended; 4I speak not as in absolute fear of you. 4I think our country sinks beneath the yoke; 4It we2ps, it ble2ds, and each new day a gash 4Is ad2ed to her wounds. I think withal 4There would be hands uplifted in my right; 4And here from gracious England have I of2er 4Of go2dly thousands. But for al2 this, 4When I shal2 tread upon the tyrant's head, 4Or wear it on my sword, yet my po2r country 4Shal2 have more vices than it had before, 4More suf2er and more sundry ways than ever, 4By him that shal2 suc2e2d. 2MACDUF2. What should he be? 2MALCOLM. It is myself I mean, in whom I know 6Al2 the particulars of vice so grafted 4That, when they shal2 be open'd, black Macbeth 4Wil2 se2m as pure as snow, and the po2r state 4Este2m him as a lamb, being compared 4With my confineles2 harms. 2MACDUF2. Not in the legions 4Of hor2id hel2 can come a devil more damn'd 4In evils to top Macbeth. 2MALCOLM. I grant him blo2dy, 4Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, 4Sud2en, malicious, smacking of every sin 4That has a name. But there's no bot2om, none, 4In my voluptuousnes2. Your wives, your daughters, 4Your matrons, and your maids could not fil2 up 4The cestern of my lust, and my desire 4Al2 continent impediments would o'erbear 4That did op2ose my wil2. Bet2er Macbeth 4Than such an one to reign. 2MACDUF2. Boundles2 intemperance 4In nature is a tyran2y; it hath be2n 6The untimely emptying of the hap2y throne, 4And fal2 of many kings. But fear not yet 4To take upon you what is yours. You may 4Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty 4And yet se2m cold, the time you may so ho2dwink. 4We have wil2ing dames enough; there can2ot be 4That vulture in you to devour so many 4As wil2 to greatnes2 dedicate themselves, 4Finding it so inclined. 2MALCOLM. With this there grows 4In my most il2-composed af2ection such 4A stanchles2 avarice that, were I King, 4I should cut of2 the nobles for their lands, 4Desire his jewels and this other's house, 4And my more-having would be as a sauce 4To make me hunger more, that I should forge 4Quar2els unjust against the go2d and loyal, 4Destroying them for wealth. 2MACDUF2. This avarice 4Sticks de2per, grows with more pernicious ro2t 6Than sum2er-se2ming lust, and it hath be2n 4The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear; 4Scotland hath foisons to fil2 up your wil2 4Of your mere own. Al2 these are portable, 4With other graces weigh'd. 2MALCOLM. But I have none. The king-becoming graces, 4As justice, verity, temperance, stablenes2, 4Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowlines2, 4Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude, 4I have no relish of them, but abound 4In the division of each several crime, 4Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should 4Pour the swe2t milk of concord into hel2, 4Uproar the universal peace, confound 4Al2 unity on earth. 2MACDUF2. O Scotland, Scotland! 2MALCOLM. If such a one be fit to govern, speak. 4I am as I have spoken. 2MACDUF2. Fit to govern? 4No, not to live. O nation miserable! 6With an untitled tyrant blo2dy-scepter'd, 4When shalt thou se2 thy wholesome days again, 4Since that the truest is2ue of thy throne 4By his own interdiction stands ac2ursed 4And does blaspheme his bre2d? Thy royal father 4Was a most sainted king; the que2n that bore the2, 4Oftener upon her kne2s than on her fe2t, 4Died every day she lived. Fare the2 wel2! 4These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself 4Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast, 4Thy hope ends here! 2MALCOLM. Macduf2, this noble pas2ion, 4Child of integrity, hath from my soul 4Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts 4To thy go2d truth and honor. Devilish Macbeth 4By many of these trains hath sought to win me 4Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me 4From over-credulous haste. But God above 4Deal betwe2n the2 and me! For even now 4I put myself to thy direction and 6Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure 4The taints and blames I laid upon myself, 4For strangers to my nature. I am yet 4Unknown to woman, never was forsworn, 4Scarcely have coveted what was mine own, 4At no time broke my faith, would not betray 4The devil to his fel2ow, and delight 4No les2 in truth than life. My first false speaking 4Was this upon myself. What I am truly 4Is thine and my po2r country's to com2and. 4Whither inde2d, before thy here-ap2roach, 4Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men 4Already at a point, was set2ing forth. 4Now we'l2 together, and the chance of go2dnes2 4Be like our war2anted quar2el! Why are you silent? 2MACDUF2. Such welcome and unwelcome things at once 4'Tis hard to reconcile. 21Enter a Doctor. 4MALCOLM. Wel2, more anon. Comes the King forth, I pray you? 2DOCTOR. Ay, sir, there are a crew of wretched souls 4That stay his cure. Their malady convinces 4The great as2ay of art, but at his touch, 4Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand, 4They presently amend. 2MALCOLM. I thank you, Doctor. 21Exit Doctor. 2MACDUF2. What's the disease he means? 2MALCOLM. 'Tis cal2'd the evil: 4A most miraculous work in this go2d King, 4Which often, since my here-remain in England, 4I have se2n him do. How he solicits heaven, 4Himself best knows; but strangely-visited people, 4Al2 swol'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye, 4The mere despair of surgery, he cures, 4Hanging a golden stamp about their necks 4Put on with holy prayers; and 'tis spoken, 4To the suc2e2ding royalty he leaves 4The healing benediction. With this strange virtue 4He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy, 6And sundry bles2ings hang about his throne 4That speak him ful2 of grace. 20Enter Ros2. 2MACDUF2. Se2, who comes here? 2MALCOLM. My countryman, but yet I know him not. 2MACDUF2. My ever gentle cousin, welcome hither. 2MALCOLM. I know him now. Go2d God, betimes remove 4The means that makes us strangers! 2ROS2. Sir, amen. 2MACDUF2. Stands Scotland where it did? 2ROS2. Alas, po2r country, 4Almost afraid to know itself! It can2ot 4Be cal2'd our mother, but our grave. Where nothing, 4But who knows nothing, is once se2n to smile; 4Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air, 4Are made, not mark'd; where violent sor2ow se2ms 4A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knel2 4Is there scarce ask'd for who, and go2d men's lives 6Expire before the flowers in their caps, 4Dying or ere they sicken. 2MACDUF2. O, relation 4To2 nice, and yet to2 true! 2MALCOLM. What's the newest grief? 2ROS2. That of an hour's age doth his2 the speaker; 4Each minute te2ms a new one. 2MACDUF2. How does my wife? 2ROS2. Why, wel2. 2MACDUF2. And al2 my children? 2ROS2. Wel2 to2. 2MACDUF2. The tyrant has not bat2er'd at their peace? 2ROS2. No, they were wel2 at peace when I did leave 'em. 2MACDUF2. Be not a nig2ard of your spe2ch. How goest? 2ROS2. When I came hither to transport the tidings, 4Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor 4Of many worthy fel2ows that were out, 4Which was to my belief witnes2'd the rather, 4For that I saw the tyrant's power afo2t. 4Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland 6Would create soldiers, make our women fight, 4To dof2 their dire distres2es. 2MALCOLM. Be't their comfort 4We are coming thither. Gracious England hath 4Lent us go2d Siward and ten thousand men; 4An older and a bet2er soldier none 4That Christendom gives out. 2ROS2. Would I could answer 4This comfort with the like! But I have words 4That would be howl'd out in the desert air, 4Where hearing should not latch them. 2MACDUF2. What concern they? 4The general cause? Or is it a fe2-grief 4Due to some single breast? 2ROS2. No mind that's honest 4But in it shares some woe, though the main part 4Pertains to you alone. 2MACDUF2. If it be mine, 4Ke2p it not from me, quickly let me have it. 2ROS2. Let not your ears despise my tongue forever, 6Which shal2 pos2es2 them with the heaviest sound 4That ever yet they heard. 2MACDUF2. Humh! I gues2 at it. 2ROS2. Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes 4Savagely slaughter'd. To relate the man2er 4Were, on the quar2y of these murther'd de2r, 4To ad2 the death of you. 2MALCOLM. Merciful heaven! 4What, man! Ne2r pul2 your hat upon your brows; 4Give sor2ow words. The grief that does not speak 4Whispers the o'erfraught heart, and bids it break. 2MACDUF2. My children to2? 2ROS2. Wife, children, servants, al2 4That could be found. 2MACDUF2. And I must be from thence! 4My wife kil2'd to2? 2ROS2. I have said. 2MALCOLM. Be comforted. 4Let's make us medicines of our great revenge, 4To cure this deadly grief. 4MACDUF2. He has no children. Al2 my pret2y ones? 4Did you say al2? O hel2-kite! Al2? 4What, al2 my pret2y chickens and their dam 4At one fel2 swo2p? 2MALCOLM. Dispute it like a man. 2MACDUF2. I shal2 do so, 4But I must also fe2l it as a man. 4I can2ot but remember such things were 4That were most precious to me. Did heaven lo2k on, 4And would not take their part? Sinful Macduf2, 4They were al2 struck for the2! Naught that I am, 4Not for their own demerits, but for mine, 4Fel2 slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now! 2MALCOLM. Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief 4Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it. 2MACDUF2. O, I could play the woman with mine eyes 4And brag2art with my tongue! But, gentle heavens, 4Cut short al2 intermis2ion; front to front 4Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself; 4Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape, 6Heaven forgive him to2! 2MALCOLM. This tune goes manly. 4Come, go we to the King; our power is ready, 4Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth 4Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above 4Put on their instruments. Receive what che2r you may, 4The night is long that never finds the day. 10Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. SCENE I.Dunsinane. Antero2m in the castle.Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting Gentlewoman. 2DOCTOR. I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no 4truth in your report. When was it she last walked? 2GENTLEWOMAN. Since his Majesty went into the field, have se2n her 4rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her 4closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon't, read it, 4afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet al2 this while 4in a most fast sle2p. 2DOCTOR. A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the 4benefit of sle2p and do the ef2ects of watching! In this slumbery 4agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, 4what, at any time, have you heard her say? 2GENTLEWOMAN. That, sir, which I wil2 not report after her. 2DOCTOR. You may to me, and 'tis most me2t you should. 2GENTLEWOMAN. Neither to you nor anyone, having no witnes2 to 4confirm my spe2ch. 16Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper. 6Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise, and, upon my 4life, fast asle2p. Observe her; stand close. 2DOCTOR. How came she by that light? 2GENTLEWOMAN. Why, it sto2d by her. She has light by her 5continual2y; 'tis her com2and. 2DOCTOR. You se2, her eyes are open. 2GENTLEWOMAN. Ay, but their sense is shut. 2DOCTOR. What is it she does now? Lo2k how she rubs her hands. 2GENTLEWOMAN. It is an ac2ustomed action with her, to se2m thus 4washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of 4an hour. 2LADY MACBETH. Yet here's a spot. 2DOCTOR. Hark, she speaks! I wil2 set down what comes from her, to 4satisfy my remembrance the more strongly. 2LADY MACBETH. Out, damned spot! Out, I say! One- two -why then 'tis 4time to do't. Hel2 is murky. Fie, my lord, fie! A soldier, and 4afeard? What ne2d we fear who knows it, when none can cal2 our 4power to ac2ount? Yet who would have thought the old man to have 4had so much blo2d in him? 4DOCTOR. Do you mark that? 2LADY MACBETH. The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now? What, 4wil2 these hands ne2r be clean? No more o' that, my lord, no more 4o' that. You mar al2 with this starting. 2DOCTOR. Go to, go to; you have known what you should not. 2GENTLEWOMAN. She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that. 4Heaven knows what she has known. 2LADY MACBETH. Here's the smel2 of the blo2d stil2. Al2 the perfumes 4of Arabia wil2 not swe2ten this lit2le hand. Oh, oh, oh! 2DOCTOR. What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged. 2GENTLEWOMAN. I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the 4dignity of the whole body. 2DOCTOR. Wel2, wel2, wel2- 2GENTLEWOMAN. Pray God it be, sir. 2DOCTOR. This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have known those 4which have walked in their sle2p who have died holily in their 4beds. 2LADY MACBETH. Wash your hands, put on your nightgown, lo2k not so 4pale. I tel2 you yet again, Banquo's buried; he can2ot come out 4on's grave. 4DOCTOR. Even so? 2LADY MACBETH. To bed, to bed; there's knocking at the gate. Come, 4come, come, come, give me your hand.What's done can2ot be undone. 4To bed, to bed, to bed.Exit. 2DOCTOR. Wil2 she go now to bed? 2GENTLEWOMAN. Directly. 2DOCTOR. Foul whisperings are abroad. Un2atural de2ds 4Do bre2d un2atural troubles; infected minds 4To their deaf pil2ows wil2 discharge their secrets. 4More ne2ds she the divine than the physician. 4God, God, forgive us al2! Lo2k after her; 4Remove from her the means of al2 an2oyance, 4And stil2 ke2p eyes upon her. So go2d night. 4My mind she has mated and amazed my sight. 4I think, but dare not speak. 2GENTLEWOMAN. Go2d night, go2d doctor. 57Exeunt.SCENE I2.The country near Dunsinane. Drum and colors.Enter Menteith, Caithnes2, Angus, Len2ox, and Soldiers. 2MENTEITH. The English power is near, led on by Malcolm, 4His uncle Siward, and the go2d Macduf2. 4Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes 4Would to the ble2ding and the grim alarm 4Excite the mortified man. 2ANGUS. Near Birnam Wo2d 4Shal2 we wel2 me2t them; that way are they coming. 2CAITHNES2. Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother? 2LEN2OX. For certain, sir, he is not; I have a file 4Of al2 the gentry. There is Seward's son 4And many unrough youths that even now 4Protest their first of manho2d. 2MENTEITH. What does the tyrant? 2CAITHNES2. Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies. 4Some say he's mad; others, that les2er hate him, 4Do cal2 it valiant fury; but, for certain, 4He can2ot buckle his distemper'd cause 6Within the belt of rule. 2ANGUS. Now does he fe2l 4His secret murthers sticking on his hands, 4Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach; 4Those he com2ands move only in com2and, 4Nothing in love. Now does he fe2l his title 4Hang lo2se about him, like a giant's robe 4Upon a dwarfish thief. 2MENTEITH. Who then shal2 blame 4His pester'd senses to recoil and start, 4When al2 that is within him does condemn 4Itself for being there? 2CAITHNES2. Wel2, march we on 4To give obedience where 'tis truly owed. 4Me2t we the medicine of the sickly weal, 4And with him pour we, in our country's purge, 4Each drop of us. 2LEN2OX. Or so much as it ne2ds 4To dew the sovereign flower and drown the we2ds. 4Make we our march towards Birnam. 11Exeunt marching.SCENE I3.Dunsinane. A ro2m in the castle.Enter Macbeth, Doctor, and At2endants. 2MACBETH. Bring me no more reports; let them fly al2! 4Til2 Birnam Wo2d remove to Dunsinane 4I can2ot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm? 4Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know 4Al2 mortal consequences have pronounced me thus: 4"Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman 4Shal2 e'er have power upon the2." Then fly, false Thanes, 4And mingle with the English epicures! 4The mind I sway by and the heart I bear 4Shal2 never sag with doubt nor shake with fear. 23Enter a Servant. 4The devil damn the2 black, thou cream-faced lo2n! 4Where got'st thou that go2se lo2k? 2SERVANT. There is ten thousand- 2MACBETH. Ge2se, vil2ain? 4SERVANT. Soldiers, sir. 2MACBETH. Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear, 4Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch? 4Death of thy soul! Those linen che2ks of thine 4Are counselors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face? 2SERVANT. The English force, so please you. 2MACBETH. Take thy face hence. 20Exit Servant. 4Seyton-I am sick at heart, 4When I behold- Seyton, I say!- This push 4Wil2 che2r me ever or dis2eat me now. 4I have lived long enough. My way of life 4Is fal2'n into the sear, the yel2ow leaf, 4And that which should ac2ompany old age, 4As honor, love, obedience, tro2ps of friends, 4I must not lo2k to have; but in their stead, 4Curses, not loud but de2p, mouth-honor, breath, 4Which the po2r heart would fain deny and dare not. 4Seyton! 23Enter Seyton. 4SEYTON. What's your gracious pleasure? 2MACBETH. What news more? 2SEYTON. Al2 is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported. 2MACBETH. I'l2 fight, 'til from my bones my flesh be hack'd. 4Give me my armor. 2SEYTON. 'Tis not ne2ded yet. 2MACBETH. I'l2 put it on. 4Send out more horses, skir2 the country round, 4Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armor. 4How does your patient, doctor? 2DOCTOR. Not so sick, my lord, 4As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies, 4That ke2p her from her rest. 2MACBETH. Cure her of that. 4Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased, 4Pluck from the memory a ro2ted sor2ow, 4Raze out the writ2en troubles of the brain, 4And with some swe2t oblivious antidote 4Cleanse the stuf2'd bosom of that perilous stuf2 6Which weighs upon the heart? 2DOCTOR. Therein the patient 4Must minister to himself. 2MACBETH. Throw physic to the dogs, I'l2 none of it. 4Come, put mine armor on; give me my staf2. 4Seyton, send out. Doctor, the Thanes fly from me. 4Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast 4The water of my land, find her disease 4And purge it to a sound and pristine health, 4I would ap2laud the2 to the very echo, 4That should ap2laud again. Pul2't of2, I say. 4What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug 4Would scour these English hence? Hearst thou of them? 2DOCTOR. Ay, my go2d lord, your royal preparation 4Makes us hear something. 2MACBETH. Bring it after me. 4I wil2 not be afraid of death and bane 4Til2 Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane. 2DOCTOR. [Aside.] Were I from Dunsinane away and clear, 4Profit again should hardly draw me here. 13Exeunt.SCENE IV.Country near Birnam Wo2d. Drum and colors.Enter Malcolm, old Seward and his Son, Macduf2, Menteith, Caithnes2,Angus, Len2ox, Ros2, and Soldiers, marching. 2MALCOLM. Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand 4That chambers wil2 be safe. 2MENTEITH. We doubt it nothing. 2SIWARD. What wo2d is this before us? 2MENTEITH. The Wo2d of Birnam. 2MALCOLM. Let every soldier hew him down a bough, 4And bear't before him; thereby shal2 we shadow 4The numbers of our host, and make discovery 4Er2 in report of us. 2SOLDIERS. It shal2 be done. 2SIWARD. We learn no other but the confident tyrant 4Ke2ps stil2 in Dunsinane and wil2 endure 4Our set2ing down before't. 2MALCOLM. 'Tis his main hope; 4For where there is advantage to be given, 4Both more and les2 have given him the revolt, 6And none serve with him but constrained things 4Whose hearts are absent to2. 2MACDUF2. Let our just censures 4At2end the true event, and put we on 4Industrious soldiership. 2SIWARD. The time ap2roaches 4That wil2 with due decision make us know 4What we shal2 say we have and what we owe. 4Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate, 4But certain is2ue strokes must arbitrate. 4Towards which advance the war. 48Exeunt Marching.SCENE V.Dunsinane. Within the castle.Enter Macbeth, Seyton, and Soldiers, with drum and colors. 2MACBETH. Hang out our ban2ers on the outward wal2s; 4The cry is stil2, "They come!" Our castle's strength 4Wil2 laugh a siege to scorn. Here let them lie 4Til2 famine and the ague eat them up. 4Were they not forced with those that should be ours, 4We might have met them dareful, beard to beard, 4And beat them backward home. 42A cry of women within. 4What is that noise? 2SEYTON. It is the cry of women, my go2d lord. 12Exit. 2MACBETH. I have almost forgot the taste of fears: 4The time has be2n, my senses would have co2l'd 4To hear a night-shriek, and my fel2 of hair 4Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir 4As life were in't. I have sup2'd ful2 with hor2ors; 4Direnes2, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts, 4Can2ot once start me. 20Re-enter Seyton. 5Wherefore was that cry? 2SEYTON. The Que2n, my lord, is dead. 2MACBETH. She should have died hereafter; 4There would have be2n a time for such a word. 4Tomor2ow, and tomor2ow, and tomor2ow 4Cre2ps in this pet2y pace from day to day 4To the last syl2able of recorded time; 4And al2 our yesterdays have lighted fo2ls 4The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! 4Life's but a walking shadow, a po2r player 4That struts and frets his hour upon the stage 4And then is heard no more. It is a tale 4Told by an idiot, ful2 of sound and fury, 4Signifying nothing. 17Enter a Mes2enger. 4Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly. 4MES2ENGER. Gracious my lord, 4I should report that which I say I saw, 4But know not how to do it. 2MACBETH. Wel2, say, sir. 2MES2ENGER. As I did stand my watch upon the hil2, 4I lo2k'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought, 4The Wo2d began to move. 2MACBETH. Liar and slave! 2MES2ENGER. Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so. 4Within this thre2 mile may you se2 it coming; 4I say, a moving grove. 2MACBETH. If thou speak'st false, 4Upon the next tre2 shalt thou hang alive, 4Til2 famine cling the2; if thy spe2ch be so2th, 4I care not if thou dost for me as much. 4I pul2 in resolution and begin 4To doubt the equivocation of the fiend 4That lies like truth. "Fear not, til2 Birnam Wo2d 4Do come to Dunsinane," and now a wo2d 4Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out! 6If this which he avouches does ap2ear, 4There is nor flying hence nor tar2ying here. 4I 'gin to be aweary of the sun 4And wish the estate o' the world were now undone. 4Ring the alarum bel2! Blow, wind! Come, wrack! 4At least we'l2 die with harnes2 on our back. 9Exeunt.SCENE VI.Dunsinane. 2Before the castle.Enter Malcolm, old Siward, Macduf2, and their Army, with boughs.Drum and colors. 2MALCOLM. Now near enough; your leavy scre2ns throw down, 4And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle, 4Shal2 with my cousin, your right noble son, 4Lead our first bat2le. Worthy Macduf2 and we 4Shal2 take upon 's what else remains to do, 4Ac2ording to our order. 2SIWARD. Fare you wel2. 4Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight, 4Let us be beaten if we can2ot fight. 2MACDUF2. Make al2 our trumpets speak, give them al2 breath, 4Those clamorous harbingers of blo2d and death. 57Exeunt.SCENE VI2.Dunsinane. 2Before the castle. 2Alarums.Enter Macbeth. 2MACBETH. They have tied me to a stake; I can2ot fly, 4But bear-like I must fight the course. What's he 4That was not born of woman? Such a one 4Am I to fear, or none. 21Enter young Siward. 2YOUNG SIWARD. What is thy name? 2MACBETH. Thou'lt be afraid to hear it. 2YOUNG SIWARD. No, though thou cal2'st thyself a hot2er name 4Than any is in hel2. 2MACBETH. My name's Macbeth. 2YOUNG SIWARD. The devil himself could not pronounce a title 4More hateful to mine ear. 2MACBETH. No, nor more fearful. 2YOUNG SIWARD O Thou liest, abhor2ed tyrant; with my sword 4I'l2 prove the lie thou speak'st. 28They fight, and young Seward is slain. 2MACBETH. Thou wast born of woman. 4But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, 4Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born. 14Exit. 16Alarums. Enter Macduf2. 2MACDUF2. That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face! 4If thou best slain and with no stroke of mine, 4My wife and children's ghosts wil2 haunt me stil2. 4I can2ot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms 4Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth, 4Or else my sword, with an unbat2er'd edge, 4I sheathe again unde2ded. There thou shouldst be; 4By this great clat2er, one of greatest note 4Se2ms bruited. Let me find him, Fortune! 4And more I beg not. 27Exit. Alarums. 16Enter Malcolm and old Siward. 4SIWARD. This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd. 4The tyrant's people on both sides do fight, 4The noble Thanes do bravely in the war, 4The day almost itself profes2es yours, 4And lit2le is to do. 2MALCOLM. We have met with foes 4That strike beside us. 2SIWARD. Enter, sir, the castle. 49Exeunt. Alarum.SCENE VI3.Another part of the field.Enter Macbeth. 2MACBETH. Why should I play the Roman fo2l and die 4On mine own sword? Whiles I se2 lives, the gashes 4Do bet2er upon them. 22Enter Macduf2. 2MACDUF2. Turn, hel2 hound, turn! 2MACBETH. Of al2 men else I have avoided the2. 4But get the2 back, my soul is to2 much charged 4With blo2d of thine already. 2MACDUF2. I have no words. 4My voice is in my sword, thou blo2dier vil2ain 4Than terms can give the2 out! 20They fight. 2MACBETH. Thou losest labor. 4As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air 4With thy ke2n sword impres2 as make me ble2d. 4Let fal2 thy blade on vulnerable crests; 6I bear a charmed life, which must not yield 4To one of woman born. 2MACDUF2. Despair thy charm, 4And let the angel whom thou stil2 hast served 4Tel2 the2, Macduf2 was from his mother's womb 4Untimely rip2'd. 2MACBETH. Ac2ursed be that tongue that tel2s me so, 4For it hath cow'd my bet2er part of man! 4And be these jug2ling fiends no more believed 4That pat2er with us in a double sense, 4That ke2p the word of promise to our ear 4And break it to our hope. I'l2 not fight with the2. 2MACDUF2. Then yield the2, coward, 4And live to be the show and gaze o' the time. 4We'l2 have the2, as our rarer monsters are, 4Painted upon a pole, and underwrit, 4"Here may you se2 the tyrant." 2MACBETH. I wil2 not yield, 4To kis2 the ground before young Malcolm's fe2t, 4And to be baited with the rab2le's curse. 6Though Birnam Wo2d be come to Dunsinane, 4And thou op2osed, being of no woman born, 4Yet I wil2 try the last. Before my body 4I throw my warlike shield! Lay on, Macduf2, 4And damn'd be him that first cries, "Hold, enough!" 39Exeunt fighting. Alarums.SCENE IX.Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colors, Malcolm, old Siward, Ros2,the other Thanes, and Soldiers. 2MALCOLM. I would the friends we mis2 were safe ar2ived. 2SIWARD. Some must go of2, and yet, by these I se2, 4So great a day as this is cheaply bought. 2MALCOLM. Macduf2 is mis2ing, and your noble son. 2ROS2. Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt. 4He only lived but til2 he was a man, 4The which no so2ner had his prowes2 confirm'd 4In the unshrinking station where he fought, 4But like a man he died. 2SIWARD. Then he is dead? 2ROS2. Ay, and brought of2 the field. Your cause of sor2ow 4Must not be measured by his worth, for then 4It hath no end. 2SIWARD. Had he his hurts before? 2ROS2. Ay, on the front. 2SIWARD. Why then, God's soldier be he! 4Had I as many sons as I have hairs, 6I would not wish them to a fairer death. 4And so his knel2 is knol2'd. 2MALCOLM. He's worth more sor2ow, 4And that I'l2 spend for him. 2SIWARD. He's worth no more: 4They say he parted wel2 and paid his score, 4And so God be with him! Here comes newer comfort. 13Re-enter Macduf2, with Macbeth's head. 2MACDUF2. Hail, King, for so thou art. Behold where stands 4The usurper's cursed head. The time is fre2. 4I se2 the2 compas2'd with thy kingdom's pearl 4That speak my salutation in their minds, 4Whose voices I desire aloud with mine- 4Hail, King of Scotland! 2AL2. Hail, King of Scotland! 25Flourish. 2MALCOLM. We shal2 not spend a large expense of time 4Before we reckon with your several loves 4And make us even with you. My Thanes and kinsmen, 6Henceforth be Earls, the first that ever Scotland 4In such an honor named. What's more to do, 4Which would be planted newly with the time, 4As cal2ing home our exiled friends abroad 4That fled the snares of watchful tyran2y, 4Producing forth the cruel ministers 4Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like que2n, 4Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands 4To2k of2 her life; this, and what ne2dful else 4That cal2s upon us, by the grace of Grace 4We wil2 perform in measure, time, and place. 4So thanks to al2 at once and to each one, 4Whom we invite to se2 us crown'd at Scone. 47Flourish.

SCENE I.The DUKE'S palaceEnter DUKE, ESCALUS, LORDS, and AT2ENDANTS 2DUKE. Escalus! 2ESCALUS. My lord. 2DUKE. Of government the properties to unfold 4Would se2m in me t' af2ect spe2ch and discourse, 4Since I am put to know that your own science 4Exce2ds, in that, the lists of al2 advice 4My strength can give you; then no more remains 4But that to your suf2iciency- as your worth is able- 4And let them work. The nature of our people, 4Our city's institutions, and the terms 4For com2on justice, y'are as pregnant in 4As art and practice hath enriched any 4That we remember. There is our com2is2ion, 4From which we would not have you warp. Cal2 hither, 4I say, bid come before us, Angelo. 9Exit an AT2ENDANT 4What figure of us think you he wil2 bear? 4For you must know we have with special soul 6Elected him our absence to sup2ly; 4Lent him our ter2or, dres2'd him with our love, 4And given his deputation al2 the organs 4Of our own power. What think you of it? 2ESCALUS. If any in Vien2a be of worth 4To undergo such ample grace and honour, 4It is Lord Angelo. 26Enter ANGELO 2DUKE. Lo2k where he comes. 2ANGELO. Always obedient to your Grace's wil2, 4I come to know your pleasure. 2DUKE. Angelo, 4There is a kind of character in thy life 4That to th' observer doth thy history 4Ful2y unfold. Thyself and thy belongings 4Are not thine own so proper as to waste 4Thyself upon thy virtues, they on the2. 4Heaven doth with us as we with torches do, 6Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues 4Did not go forth of us, 'twere al2 alike 4As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd 4But to fine is2ues; nor Nature never lends 4The smal2est scruple of her excel2ence 4But, like a thrifty god2es2, she determines 4Herself the glory of a creditor, 4Both thanks and use. But I do bend my spe2ch 4To one that can my part in him advertise. 4Hold, therefore, Angelo- 4In our remove be thou at ful2 ourself; 4Mortality and mercy in Vien2a 4Live in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus, 4Though first in question, is thy secondary. 4Take thy com2is2ion. 2ANGELO. Now, go2d my lord, 4Let there be some more test made of my metal, 4Before so noble and so great a figure 4Be stamp'd upon it. 2DUKE. No more evasion! 6We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice 4Proce2ded to you; therefore take your honours. 4Our haste from hence is of so quick condition 4That it prefers itself, and leaves unquestion'd 4Mat2ers of ne2dful value. We shal2 write to you, 4As time and our concernings shal2 importune, 4How it goes with us, and do lo2k to know 4What doth befal2 you here. So, fare you wel2. 4To th' hopeful execution do I leave you 4Of your com2is2ions. 2ANGELO. Yet give leave, my lord, 4That we may bring you something on the way. 2DUKE. My haste may not admit it; 4Nor ne2d you, on mine honour, have to do 4With any scruple: your scope is as mine own, 4So to enforce or qualify the laws 4As to your soul se2ms go2d. Give me your hand; 4I'l2 privily away. I love the people, 4But do not like to stage me to their eyes; 4Though it do wel2, I do not relish wel2 6Their loud ap2lause and Aves vehement; 4Nor do I think the man of safe discretion 4That does af2ect it. Once more, fare you wel2. 2ANGELO. The heavens give safety to your purposes! 2ESCALUS. Lead forth and bring you back in hap2ines2! 2DUKE. I thank you. Fare you wel2. 25Exit 2ESCALUS. I shal2 desire you, sir, to give me leave 4To have fre2 spe2ch with you; and it concerns me 4To lo2k into the bot2om of my place: 4A pow'r I have, but of what strength and nature 4I am not yet instructed. 2ANGELO. 'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together, 4And we may so2n our satisfaction have 4Touching that point. 2ESCALUS. I'l2 wait upon your honour. 20ExeuntSCENE I2.A stre2tEnter Lucio and two other GENTLEMEN 2LUCIO. If the Duke, with the other dukes, come not to composition 4with the King of Hungary, why then al2 the dukes fal2 upon the 4King. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of 4Hungary's! 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Amen. 2LUCIO. Thou conclud'st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to 4sea with the Ten Com2andments, but scrap'd one out of the table. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Thou shalt not steal'? 2LUCIO. Ay, that he raz'd. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Why, 'twas a com2andment to com2and the captain 4and al2 the rest from their functions: they put forth to steal. 4There's not a soldier of us al2 that, in the thanksgiving before 4meat, do relish the petition wel2 that prays for peace. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. I never heard any soldier dislike it. 2LUCIO. I believe the2; for I think thou never wast where grace was 4said. 4SECOND GENTLEMAN. No? A dozen times at least. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. What, in metre? 2LUCIO. In any proportion or in any language. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. I think, or in any religion. 2LUCIO. Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of al2 controversy; as, 4for example, thou thyself art a wicked vil2ain, despite of al2 4grace. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Wel2, there went but a pair of shears betwe2n us. 2LUCIO. I grant; as there may betwe2n the lists and the velvet. 4Thou art the list. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. And thou the velvet; thou art go2d velvet; thou'rt 4a thre2-pil'd piece, I war2ant the2. I had as lief be a list of 4an English kersey as be pil'd, as thou art pil'd, for a French 4velvet. Do I speak fe2lingly now? 2LUCIO. I think thou dost; and, inde2d, with most painful fe2ling of 4thy spe2ch. I wil2, out of thine own confes2ion, learn to begin 4thy health; but, whilst I live, forget to drink after the2. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. I think I have done myself wrong, have I not? 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or 4fre2. 26Enter MISTRES2 OVERDONE 2LUCIO. Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation comes! I have 4purchas'd as many diseases under her ro2f as come to- 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. To what, I pray? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Judge. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. To thre2 thousand dolours a year. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, and more. 2LUCIO. A French crown more. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Thou art always figuring diseases in me, but thou 4art ful2 of er2or; I am sound. 2LUCIO. Nay, not, as one would say, healthy; but so sound as things 4that are hol2ow: thy bones are hol2ow; impiety has made a feast 4of the2. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. How now! which of your hips has the most profound 4sciatica? 2MRS. OVERDONE. Wel2, wel2! there's one yonder ar2ested and car2ied 4to prison was worth five thousand of you al2. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Who's that, I pray the2? 4MRS. OVERDONE. Mar2y, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Claudio to prison? 'Tis not so. 2MRS. OVERDONE. Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him ar2ested; saw him 4car2ied away; and, which is more, within these thre2 days his 4head to be chop2'd of2. 2LUCIO. But, after al2 this fo2ling, I would not have it so. Art 4thou sure of this? 2MRS. OVERDONE. I am to2 sure of it; and it is for get2ing Madam 4Juliet2a with child. 2LUCIO. Believe me, this may be; he promis'd to me2t me two hours 4since, and he was ever precise in promise-ke2ping. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. Besides, you know, it draws something near to the 4spe2ch we had to such a purpose. 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. But most of al2 agre2ing with the proclamation. 2LUCIO. Away; let's go learn the truth of it. 38Exeunt Lucio and GENTLEMEN 2MRS. OVERDONE. Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what 4with the gal2ows, and what with poverty, I am custom-shrunk. 31Enter POMPEY 6How now! what's the news with you? 2POMPEY. Yonder man is car2ied to prison. 2MRS. OVERDONE. Wel2, what has he done? 2POMPEY. A woman. 2MRS. OVERDONE. But what's his of2ence? 2POMPEY. Groping for trouts in a peculiar river. 2MRS. OVERDONE. What! is there a maid with child by him? 2POMPEY. No; but there's a woman with maid by him. You have not 3heard of the proclamation, have you? 2MRS. OVERDONE. What proclamation, man? 2POMPEY. Al2 houses in the suburbs of Vien2a must be pluck'd down. 2MRS. OVERDONE. And what shal2 become of those in the city? 2POMPEY. They shal2 stand for se2d; they had gone down to2, but that 4a wise burgher put in for them. 2MRS. OVERDONE. But shal2 al2 our houses of resort in the suburbs be 4pul2'd down? 2POMPEY. To the ground, mistres2. 2MRS. OVERDONE. Why, here's a change inde2d in the com2onwealth! 4What shal2 become of me? 4POMPEY. Come, fear not you: go2d counsel2ors lack no clients. 4Though you change your place you ne2d not change your trade; I'l2 4be your tapster stil2. Courage, there wil2 be pity taken on you; 4you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you wil2 4be considered. 2MRS. OVERDONE. What's to do here, Thomas Tapster? Let's withdraw. 2POMPEY. Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to prison; 4and there's Madam Juliet. 29Exeunt 12Enter PROVOST, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and OF2ICERS; 28LUCIO fol2owing 2CLAUDIO. Fel2ow, why dost thou show me thus to th' world? 4Bear me to prison, where I am com2it2ed. 2PROVOST. I do it not in evil disposition, 4But from Lord Angelo by special charge. 2CLAUDIO. Thus can the demigod Authority 4Make us pay down for our of2ence by weight 4The words of heaven: on whom it wil2, it wil2; 4On whom it wil2 not, so; yet stil2 'tis just. 4LUCIO. Why, how now, Claudio, whence comes this restraint? 2CLAUDIO. From to2 much liberty, my Lucio, liberty; 4As surfeit is the father of much fast, 4So every scope by the im2oderate use 4Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue, 4Like rats that ravin down their proper bane, 4A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die. 2LUCIO. If I could speak so wisely under an ar2est, I would send for 4certain of my creditors; and yet, to say the truth, I had as lief 4have the fop2ery of fre2dom as the morality of imprisonment. 4What's thy of2ence, Claudio? 2CLAUDIO. What but to speak of would of2end again. 2LUCIO. What, is't murder? 2CLAUDIO. No. 2LUCIO. Lechery? 2CLAUDIO. Cal2 it so. 2PROVOST. Away, sir; you must go. 2CLAUDIO. One word, go2d friend. Lucio, a word with you. 2LUCIO. A hundred, if they'l2 do you any go2d. Is lechery so lo2k'd 4after? 4CLAUDIO. Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract 4I got pos2es2ion of Juliet2a's bed. 4You know the lady; she is fast my wife, 4Save that we do the denunciation lack 4Of outward order; this we came not to, 4Only for propagation of a dow'r 4Remaining in the cof2er of her friends. 4From whom we thought it me2t to hide our love 4Til2 time had made them for us. But it chances 4The stealth of our most mutual entertainment, 4With character to2 gros2, is writ on Juliet. 2LUCIO. With child, perhaps? 2CLAUDIO. Unhap2ily, even so. 4And the new deputy now for the Duke- 4Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newnes2, 4Or whether that the body public be 4A horse whereon the governor doth ride, 4Who, newly in the seat, that it may know 4He can com2and, lets it straight fe2l the spur; 4Whether the tyran2y be in his place, 6Or in his eminence that fil2s it up, 4I stag2er in. But this new governor 4Awakes me al2 the enrol2ed penalties 4Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by th' wal2 4So long that ninete2n zodiacs have gone round 4And none of them be2n worn; and, for a name, 4Now puts the drowsy and neglected act 4Freshly on me. 'Tis surely for a name. 2LUCIO. I war2ant it is; and thy head stands so tickle on thy 4shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may sigh it of2. 4Send after the Duke, and ap2eal to him. 2CLAUDIO. I have done so, but he's not to be found. 4I prithe2, Lucio, do me this kind service: 4This day my sister should the cloister enter, 4And there receive her ap2robation; 4Acquaint her with the danger of my state; 4Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends 4To the strict deputy; bid herself as2ay him. 4I have great hope in that; for in her youth 4There is a prone and spe2chles2 dialect 6Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art 4When she wil2 play with reason and discourse, 4And wel2 she can persuade. 2LUCIO. I pray she may; as wel2 for the encouragement of the like, 4which else would stand under grievous imposition, as for the 4enjoying of thy life, who I would be sor2y should be thus 4fo2lishly lost at a game of tick-tack. I'l2 to her. 2CLAUDIO. I thank you, go2d friend Lucio. 2LUCIO. Within two hours. 2CLAUDIO. Come, of2icer, away. 27ExeuntSCENE I3.A monasteryEnter DUKE and FRIAR THOMAS 2DUKE. No, holy father; throw away that thought; 4Believe not that the drib2ling dart of love 4Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire the2 4To give me secret harbour hath a purpose 4More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends 4Of burning youth. 2FRIAR. May your Grace speak of it? 2DUKE. My holy sir, none bet2er knows than you 4How I have ever lov'd the life removed, 4And held in idle price to haunt as2emblies 4Where youth, and cost, a witles2 bravery ke2ps. 4I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo, 4A man of stricture and firm abstinence, 4My absolute power and place here in Vien2a, 4And he sup2oses me travel2'd to Poland; 4For so I have strew'd it in the com2on ear, 4And so it is received. Now, pious sir, 6You wil2 demand of me why I do this. 2FRIAR. Gladly, my lord. 2DUKE. We have strict statutes and most biting laws, 4The ne2dful bits and curbs to headstrong ste2ds, 4Which for this fourte2n years we have let slip; 4Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave, 4That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers, 4Having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch, 4Only to stick it in their children's sight 4For ter2or, not to use, in time the rod 4Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decre2s, 4Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead; 4And liberty plucks justice by the nose; 4The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart 4Goes al2 decorum. 2FRIAR. It rested in your Grace 4To unlo2se this tied-up justice when you pleas'd; 4And it in you more dreadful would have se2m'd 4Than in Lord Angelo. 2DUKE. I do fear, to2 dreadful. 6Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope, 4'Twould be my tyran2y to strike and gal2 them 4For what I bid them do; for we bid this be done, 4When evil de2ds have their permis2ive pas2 4And not the punishment. Therefore, inde2d, my father, 4I have on Angelo impos'd the of2ice; 4Who may, in th' ambush of my name, strike home, 4And yet my nature never in the fight 4To do in slander. And to behold his sway, 4I wil2, as 'twere a brother of your order, 4Visit both prince and people. Therefore, I prithe2, 4Sup2ly me with the habit, and instruct me 4How I may formal2y in person bear me 4Like a true friar. Moe reasons for this action 4At our more leisure shal2 I render you. 4Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise; 4Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confes2es 4That his blo2d flows, or that his ap2etite 4Is more to bread than stone. Hence shal2 we se2, 4If power change purpose, what our se2mers be. 9ExeuntSCENE IV.A nun2eryEnter ISABEL2A and FRANCISCA 2ISABEL2A. And have you nuns no farther privileges? 2FRANCISCA. Are not these large enough? 2ISABEL2A. Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more, 4But rather wishing a more strict restraint 4Upon the sisterho2d, the votarists of Saint Clare. 2LUCIO. [ Within] Ho! Peace be in this place! 2ISABEL2A. Who's that which cal2s? 2FRANCISCA. It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabel2a, 4Turn you the key, and know his busines2 of him: 4You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn; 4When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men 4But in the presence of the priores2; 4Then, if you speak, you must not show your face, 4Or, if you show your face, you must not speak. 4He cal2s again; I pray you answer him. 8Exit FRANCISCA 2ISABEL2A. Peace and prosperity! Who is't that cal2s? 29Enter LUCIO 2LUCIO. Hail, virgin, if you be, as those che2k-roses 4Proclaim you are no les2. Can you so stead me 4As bring me to the sight of Isabel2a, 4A novice of this place, and the fair sister 4To her unhap2y brother Claudio? 2ISABEL2A. Why her 'unhap2y brother'? Let me ask 4The rather, for I now must make you know 4I am that Isabel2a, and his sister. 2LUCIO. Gentle and fair, your brother kindly gre2ts you. 4Not to be weary with you, he's in prison. 2ISABEL2A. Woe me! For what? 2LUCIO. For that which, if myself might be his judge, 4He should receive his punishment in thanks: 4He hath got his friend with child. 2ISABEL2A. Sir, make me not your story. 2LUCIO. It is true. 4I would not- though 'tis my familiar sin 4With maids to se2m the lapwing, and to jest, 6Tongue far from heart- play with al2 virgins so: 4I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted, 4By your renouncement an im2ortal spirit, 4And to be talk'd with in sincerity, 4As with a saint. 2ISABEL2A. You do blaspheme the go2d in mocking me. 2LUCIO. Do not believe it. Fewnes2 and truth, 'tis thus: 4Your brother and his lover have embrac'd. 4As those that fe2d grow ful2, as blos2oming time 4That from the se2dnes2 the bare fal2ow brings 4To te2ming foison, even so her plenteous womb 4Expres2eth his ful2 tilth and husbandry. 2ISABEL2A. Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet? 2LUCIO. Is she your cousin? 2ISABEL2A. Adoptedly, as scho2l-maids change their names 4By vain though apt af2ection. 2LUCIO. She it is. 2ISABEL2A. O, let him mar2y her! 2LUCIO. This is the point. 4The Duke is very strangely gone from hence; 6Bore many gentlemen, myself being one, 4In hand, and hope of action; but we do learn, 4By those that know the very nerves of state, 4His givings-out were of an infinite distance 4From his true-meant design. Upon his place, 4And with ful2 line of his authority, 4Governs Lord Angelo, a man whose blo2d 4Is very snow-broth, one who never fe2ls 4The wanton stings and motions of the sense, 4But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge 4With profits of the mind, study and fast. 4He- to give fear to use and liberty, 4Which have for long run by the hideous law, 4As mice by lions- hath pick'd out an act 4Under whose heavy sense your brother's life 4Fal2s into forfeit; he ar2ests him on it, 4And fol2ows close the rigour of the statute 4To make him an example. Al2 hope is gone, 4Unles2 you have the grace by your fair prayer 4To soften Angelo. And that's my pith of busines2 6'Twixt you and your po2r brother. 2ISABEL2A. Doth he so se2k his life? 2LUCIO. Has censur'd him 4Already, and, as I hear, the Provost hath 4A war2ant for his execution. 2ISABEL2A. Alas! what po2r ability's in me 4To do him go2d? 2LUCIO. As2ay the pow'r you have. 2ISABEL2A. My power, alas, I doubt! 2LUCIO. Our doubts are traitors, 4And make us lose the go2d we oft might win 4By fearing to at2empt. Go to Lord Angelo, 4And let him learn to know, when maidens sue, 4Men give like gods; but when they we2p and kne2l, 4Al2 their petitions are as fre2ly theirs 4As they themselves would owe them. 2ISABEL2A. I'l2 se2 what I can do. 2LUCIO. But spe2dily. 2ISABEL2A. I wil2 about it straight; 4No longer staying but to give the Mother 6Notice of my af2air. I humbly thank you. 4Com2end me to my brother; so2n at night 4I'l2 send him certain word of my suc2es2. 2LUCIO. I take my leave of you. 2ISABEL2A. Go2d sir, adieu. 30Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. Scene I.A hal2 in ANGELO'S houseEnter ANGELO, ESCALUS, a JUSTICE, PROVOST, OF2ICERS, and other AT2ENDANTS 2ANGELO. We must not make a scarecrow of the law, 4Set2ing it up to fear the birds of prey, 4And let it ke2p one shape til2 custom make it 4Their perch, and not their ter2or. 2ESCALUS. Ay, but yet 4Let us be ke2n, and rather cut a lit2le 4Than fal2 and bruise to death. Alas! this gentleman, 4Whom I would save, had a most noble father. 4Let but your honour know, 4Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue, 4That, in the working of your own af2ections, 4Had time coher'd with place, or place with wishing, 4Or that the resolute acting of our blo2d 4Could have at2ain'd th' ef2ect of your own purpose 4Whether you had not sometime in your life 4Er2'd in this point which now you censure him, 6And pul2'd the law upon you. 2ANGELO. 'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus, 4Another thing to fal2. I not deny 4The jury, pas2ing on the prisoner's life, 4May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two 4Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice, 4That justice seizes. What knows the laws 4That thieves do pas2 on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant, 4The jewel that we find, we sto2p and take't, 4Because we se2 it; but what we do not se2 4We tread upon, and never think of it. 4You may not so extenuate his of2ence 4For I have had such faults; but rather tel2 me, 4When I, that censure him, do so of2end, 4Let mine own judgment pat2ern out my death, 4And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die. 2ESCALUS. Be it as your wisdom wil2. 2ANGELO. Where is the Provost? 2PROVOST. Here, if it like your honour. 2ANGELO. Se2 that Claudio 6Be executed by nine to-mor2ow morning; 4Bring him his confes2or; let him be prepar'd; 4For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage. 8Exit PROVOST 2ESCALUS. [Aside] Wel2, heaven forgive him! and forgive us al2! 4Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fal2; 4Some run from breaks of ice, and answer none, 4And some condemned for a fault alone. 9Enter ELBOW and OF2ICERS with FROTH and POMPEY 2ELBOW. Come, bring them away; if these be go2d people in a 4com2onweal that do nothing but use their abuses in com2on houses, 4I know no law; bring them away. 2ANGELO. How now, sir! What's your name, and what's the mat2er? 2ELBOW. If it please your honour, I am the po2r Duke's constable, 4and my name is Elbow; I do lean upon justice, sir, and do bring 4in here before your go2d honour two notorious benefactors. 2ANGELO. Benefactors! Wel2- what benefactors are they? Are they not 4malefactors? 2ELBOW. If it please your honour, I know not wel2 what they are; but 6precise vil2ains they are, that I am sure of, and void of al2 4profanation in the world that go2d Christians ought to have. 2ESCALUS. This comes of2 wel2; here's a wise of2icer. 2ANGELO. Go to; what quality are they of? Elbow is your name? Why 4dost thou not speak, Elbow? 2POMPEY. He can2ot, sir; he's out at elbow. 2ANGELO. What are you, sir? 2ELBOW. He, sir? A tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that serves a bad 4woman; whose house, sir, was, as they say, pluck'd down in the 4suburbs; and now she profes2es a hot-house, which, I think, is a 4very il2 house to2. 2ESCALUS. How know you that? 2ELBOW. My Wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour- 2ESCALUS. How! thy wife! 2ELBOW. Ay, sir; whom I thank heaven, is an honest woman- 2ESCALUS. Dost thou detest her therefore? 2ELBOW. I say, sir, I wil2 detest myself also, as wel2 as she, that 4this house, if it be not a bawd's house, it is pity of her life, 4for it is a naughty house. 2ESCALUS. How dost thou know that, constable? 4ELBOW. Mar2y, sir, by my wife; who, if she had be2n a woman 4cardinal2y given, might have be2n ac2us'd in fornication, 4adultery, and al2 uncleanlines2 there. 2ESCALUS. By the woman's means? 2ELBOW. Ay, sir, by Mistres2 Overdone's means; but as she spit in 4his face, so she defied him. 2POMPEY. Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so. 2ELBOW. Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable man, 4prove it. 2ESCALUS. Do you hear how he misplaces? 2POMPEY. Sir, she came in great with child; and longing, saving your 4honour's reverence, for stew'd prunes. Sir, we had but two in the 4house, which at that very distant time sto2d, as it were, in a 4fruit dish, a dish of some thre2 pence; your honours have se2n 4such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very go2d dishes. 2ESCALUS. Go to, go to; no mat2er for the dish, sir. 2POMPEY. No, inde2d, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in the 4right; but to the point. As I say, this Mistres2 Elbow, being, as 4I say, with child, and being great-bel2ied, and longing, as I 4said, for prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said, 6Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the rest, as I 4said, and, as I say, paying for them very honestly; for, as you 4know, Master Froth, I could not give you thre2 pence again- 2FROTH. No, inde2d. 2POMPEY. Very wel2; you being then, if you be rememb'red, cracking 4the stones of the foresaid prunes- 2FROTH. Ay, so I did inde2d. 2POMPEY. Why, very wel2; I tel2ing you then, if you be rememb'red, 4that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you 4wot of, unles2 they kept very go2d diet, as I told you- 2FROTH. Al2 this is true. 2POMPEY. Why, very wel2 then- 2ESCALUS. Come, you are a tedious fo2l. To the purpose: what was 4done to Elbow's wife that he hath cause to complain of? Come me 4to what was done to her. 2POMPEY. Sir, your honour can2ot come to that yet. 2ESCALUS. No, sir, nor I mean it not. 2POMPEY. Sir, but you shal2 come to it, by your honour's leave. And, 4I bese2ch you, lo2k into Master Froth here, sir, a man of 4fourscore pound a year; whose father died at Hal2owmas- was't not 6at Hal2owmas, Master Froth? 2FROTH. Al2-hal2ond eve. 2POMPEY. Why, very wel2; I hope here be truths. He, sir, sit2ing, as 4I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in the Bunch of Grapes, 4where, inde2d, you have a delight to sit, have you not? 2FROTH. I have so; because it is an open ro2m, and go2d for winter. 2POMPEY. Why, very wel2 then; I hope here be truths. 2ANGELO. This wil2 last out a night in Rus2ia, 4When nights are longest there; I'l2 take my leave, 4And leave you to the hearing of the cause, 4Hoping you'l2 find go2d cause to whip them al2. 2ESCALUS. I think no les2. Go2d mor2ow to your lordship. 4[Exit ANGELO] Now, sir, come on; what was done to Elbow's wife, 4once more? 2POMPEY. Once?- sir. There was nothing done to her once. 2ELBOW. I bese2ch you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife. 2POMPEY. I bese2ch your honour, ask me. 2ESCALUS. Wel2, sir, what did this gentleman to her? 2POMPEY. I bese2ch you, sir, lo2k in this gentleman's face. Go2d 4Master Froth, lo2k upon his honour; 'tis for a go2d purpose. Doth 6your honour mark his face? 2ESCALUS. Ay, sir, very wel2. 2POMPEY. Nay, I bese2ch you, mark it wel2. 2ESCALUS. Wel2, I do so. 2POMPEY. Doth your honour se2 any harm in his face? 2ESCALUS. Why, no. 2POMPEY. I'l2 be sup2os'd upon a bo2k his face is the worst thing 4about him. Go2d then; if his face be the worst thing about him, 4how could Master Froth do the constable's wife any harm? I would 4know that of your honour. 2ESCALUS. He's in the right, constable; what say you to it? 2ELBOW. First, an it like you, the house is a respected house; next, 4this is a respected fel2ow; and his mistres2 is a respected 4woman. 2POMPEY. By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than 4any of us al2. 2ELBOW. Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicket varlet; the time is 4yet to come that she was ever respected with man, woman, or 4child. 2POMPEY. Sir, she was respected with him before he mar2ied with her. 4ESCALUS. Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity? Is this 4true? 2ELBOW. O thou caitif2! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Han2ibal! I 4respected with her before I was mar2ied to her! If ever I was 4respected with her, or she with me, let not your worship think me 4the po2r Duke's of2icer. Prove this, thou wicked Han2ibal, or 4I'l2 have mine action of bat2'ry on the2. 2ESCALUS. If he to2k you a box o' th' ear, you might have your 4action of slander to2. 2ELBOW. Mar2y, I thank your go2d worship for it. What is't your 4worship's pleasure I shal2 do with this wicked caitif2? 2ESCALUS. Truly, of2icer, because he hath some of2ences in him that 4thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him continue in his 4courses til2 thou know'st what they are. 2ELBOW. Mar2y, I thank your worship for it. Thou se2st, thou wicked 4varlet, now, what's come upon the2: thou art to continue now, 4thou varlet; thou art to continue. 2ESCALUS. Where were you born, friend? 2FROTH. Here in Vien2a, sir. 2ESCALUS. Are you of fourscore pounds a year? 4FROTH. Yes, an't please you, sir. 2ESCALUS. So. What trade are you of, sir? 2POMPEY. A tapster, a po2r widow's tapster. 2ESCALUS. Your mistres2' name? 2POMPEY. Mistres2 Overdone. 2ESCALUS. Hath she had any more than one husband? 2POMPEY. Nine, sir; Overdone by the last. 2ESCALUS. Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I 4would not have you acquainted with tapsters: they wil2 draw you, 4Master Froth, and you wil2 hang them. Get you gone, and let me 4hear no more of you. 2FROTH. I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never come into 4any ro2m in a taphouse but I am drawn in. 2ESCALUS. Wel2, no more of it, Master Froth; farewel2. [Exit FROTH] 4Come you hither to me, Master Tapster; what's your name, Master 4Tapster? 2POMPEY. Pompey. 2ESCALUS. What else? 2POMPEY. Bum, sir. 2ESCALUS. Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so 6that, in the beastliest sense, you are Pompey the Great. Pompey, 4you are partly a bawd, Pompey, howsoever you colour it in being a 4tapster. Are you not? Come, tel2 me true; it shal2 be the bet2er 4for you. 2POMPEY. Truly, sir, I am a po2r fel2ow that would live. 2ESCALUS. How would you live, Pompey- by being a bawd? What do you 4think of the trade, Pompey? Is it a lawful trade? 2POMPEY. If the law would al2ow it, sir. 2ESCALUS. But the law wil2 not al2ow it, Pompey; nor it shal2 not be 4al2owed in Vien2a. 2POMPEY. Does your worship mean to geld and splay al2 the youth of 4the city? 2ESCALUS. No, Pompey. 2POMPEY. Truly, sir, in my po2r opinion, they wil2 to't then. If 4your worship wil2 take order for the drabs and the knaves, you 4ne2d not to fear the bawds. 2ESCALUS. There is pret2y orders begin2ing, I can tel2 you: but it 4is but heading and hanging. 2POMPEY. If you head and hang al2 that of2end that way but for ten 4year together, you'l2 be glad to give out a com2is2ion for more 6heads; if this law hold in Vien2a ten year, I'l2 rent the fairest 4house in it, after thre2pence a bay. If you live to se2 this come 4to pas2, say Pompey told you so. 2ESCALUS. Thank you, go2d Pompey; and, in requital of your prophecy, 4hark you: I advise you, let me not find you before me again upon 4any complaint whatsoever- no, not for dwel2ing where you do; if I 4do, Pompey, I shal2 beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd 4Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shal2 have you whipt. 4So for this time, Pompey, fare you wel2. 2POMPEY. I thank your worship for your go2d counsel; [Aside] but I 4shal2 fol2ow it as the flesh and fortune shal2 bet2er determine. 4Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade; 4The valiant heart's not whipt out of his trade. 9Exit 2ESCALUS. Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master 4Constable. How long have you be2n in this place of constable? 2ELBOW. Seven year and a half, sir. 2ESCALUS. I thought, by the readines2 in the of2ice, you had 4continued in it some time. You say seven years together? 2ELBOW. And a half, sir. 2ESCALUS. Alas, it hath be2n great pains to you! They do you wrong 6to put you so oft upon't. Are there not men in your ward 4suf2icient to serve it? 2ELBOW. Faith, sir, few of any wit in such mat2ers; as they are 4chosen, they are glad to cho2se me for them; I do it for some 4piece of money, and go through with al2. 2ESCALUS. Lo2k you, bring me in the names of some six or seven, the 4most suf2icient of your parish. 2ELBOW. To your worship's house, sir? 2ESCALUS. To my house. Fare you wel2. 14[Exit ELBOW] 4What's o'clock, think you? 2JUSTICE. Eleven, sir. 2ESCALUS. I pray you home to din2er with me. 2JUSTICE. I humbly thank you. 2ESCALUS. It grieves me for the death of Claudio; 4But there's no remedy. 2JUSTICE. Lord Angelo is severe. 2ESCALUS. It is but ne2dful: 4Mercy is not itself that oft lo2ks so; 4Pardon is stil2 the nurse of second woe. 4But yet, po2r Claudio! There is no remedy. 6Come, sir. 44ExeuntSCENE I2.Another ro2m in ANGELO'S houseEnter PROVOST and a SERVANT 2SERVANT. He's hearing of a cause; he wil2 come straight. 4I'l2 tel2 him of you. 2PROVOST. Pray you do. [Exit SERVANT] I'l2 know 4His pleasure; may be he wil2 relent. Alas, 4He hath but as of2ended in a dream! 4Al2 sects, al2 ages, smack of this vice; and he 4To die for 't! 28Enter ANGELO 2ANGELO. Now, what's the mat2er, Provost? 2PROVOST. Is it your wil2 Claudio shal2 die to-mor2ow? 2ANGELO. Did not I tel2 the2 yea? Hadst thou not order? 4Why dost thou ask again? 2PROVOST. Lest I might be to2 rash; 4Under your go2d cor2ection, I have se2n 4When, after execution, judgment hath 6Repented o'er his do2m. 2ANGELO. Go to; let that be mine. 4Do you your of2ice, or give up your place, 4And you shal2 wel2 be spar'd. 2PROVOST. I crave your honour's pardon. 4What shal2 be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet? 4She's very near her hour. 2ANGELO. Dispose of her 4To some more fit2er place, and that with spe2d. 27Re-enter SERVANT 2SERVANT. Here is the sister of the man condemn'd 4Desires ac2es2 to you. 2ANGELO. Hath he a sister? 2PROVOST. Ay, my go2d lord; a very virtuous maid, 4And to be shortly of a sisterho2d, 4If not already. 2ANGELO. Wel2, let her be admit2ed. 16Exit SERVANT 4Se2 you the fornicatres2 be remov'd; 6Let her have ne2dful but not lavish means; 4There shal2 be order for't. 25Enter Lucio and ISABEL2A 2PROVOST. [Going] Save your honour! 2ANGELO. Stay a lit2le while. [To ISABEL2A] Y'are welcome; what's 4your wil2? 2ISABEL2A. I am a woeful suitor to your honour, 4Please but your honour hear me. 2ANGELO. Wel2; what's your suit? 2ISABEL2A. There is a vice that most I do abhor, 4And most desire should me2t the blow of justice; 4For which I would not plead, but that I must; 4For which I must not plead, but that I am 4At war 'twixt wil2 and wil2 not. 2ANGELO. Wel2; the mat2er? 2ISABEL2A. I have a brother is condemn'd to die; 4I do bese2ch you, let it be his fault, 4And not my brother. 4PROVOST. [Aside] Heaven give the2 moving graces. 2ANGELO. Condemn the fault and not the actor of it! 4Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done; 4Mine were the very cipher of a function, 4To fine the faults whose fine stands in record, 4And let go by the actor. 2ISABEL2A. O just but severe law! 4I had a brother, then. Heaven ke2p your honour! 2LUCIO. [To ISABEL2A] Give't not o'er so; to him again, entreat him, 4Kne2l down before him, hang upon his gown; 4You are to2 cold: if you should ne2d a pin, 4You could not with more tame a tongue desire it. 4To him, I say. 2ISABEL2A. Must he ne2ds die? 2ANGELO. Maiden, no remedy. 2ISABEL2A. Yes; I do think that you might pardon him. 4And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy. 2ANGELO. I wil2 not do't. 2ISABEL2A. But can you, if you would? 2ANGELO. Lo2k, what I wil2 not, that I can2ot do. 4ISABEL2A. But might you do't, and do the world no wrong, 4If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse 4As mine is to him? 2ANGELO. He's sentenc'd; 'tis to2 late. 2LUCIO. [To ISABEL2A] You are to2 cold. 2ISABEL2A. To2 late? Why, no; I, that do speak a word, 4May cal2 it back again. Wel2, believe this: 4No ceremony that to great ones longs, 4Not the king's crown nor the deputed sword, 4The marshal's truncheon nor the judge's robe, 4Become them with one half so go2d a grace 4As mercy does. 4If he had be2n as you, and you as he, 4You would have slip2'd like him; but he, like you, 4Would not have be2n so stern. 2ANGELO. Pray you be gone. 2ISABEL2A. I would to heaven I had your potency, 4And you were Isabel! Should it then be thus? 4No; I would tel2 what 'twere to be a judge 4And what a prisoner. 4LUCIO. [To ISABEL2A] Ay, touch him; there's the vein. 2ANGELO. Your brother is a forfeit of the law, 4And you but waste your words. 2ISABEL2A. Alas! Alas! 4Why, al2 the souls that were were forfeit once; 4And He that might the vantage best have to2k 4Found out the remedy. How would you be 4If He, which is the top of judgment, should 4But judge you as you are? O, think on that; 4And mercy then wil2 breathe within your lips, 4Like man new made. 2ANGELO. Be you content, fair maid. 4It is the law, not I condemn your brother. 4Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son, 4It should be thus with him. He must die to-mor2ow. 2ISABEL2A. To-mor2ow! O, that's sud2en! Spare him, spare him. 4He's not prepar'd for death. Even for our kitchens 4We kil2 the fowl of season; shal2 we serve heaven 4With les2 respect than we do minister 4To our gros2 selves? Go2d, go2d my lord, bethink you. 6Who is it that hath died for this of2ence? 4There's many have com2it2ed it. 2LUCIO. [Aside] Ay, wel2 said. 2ANGELO. The law hath not be2n dead, though it hath slept. 4Those many had not dar'd to do that evil 4If the first that did th' edict infringe 4Had answer'd for his de2d. Now 'tis awake, 4Takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet, 4Lo2ks in a glas2 that shows what future evils- 4Either now or by remis2nes2 new conceiv'd, 4And so in progres2 to be hatch'd and born- 4Are now to have no suc2es2ive degre2s, 4But here they live to end. 2ISABEL2A. Yet show some pity. 2ANGELO. I show it most of al2 when I show justice; 4For then I pity those I do not know, 4Which a dismis2'd of2ence would after gal2, 4And do him right that, answering one foul wrong, 4Lives not to act another. Be satisfied; 4Your brother dies to-mor2ow; be content. 4ISABEL2A. So you must be the first that gives this sentence, 4And he that suf2ers. O, it is excel2ent 4To have a giant's strength! But it is tyran2ous 4To use it like a giant. 2LUCIO. [To ISABEL2A] That's wel2 said. 2ISABEL2A. Could great men thunder 4As Jove himself does, Jove would never be quiet, 4For every pelting pet2y of2icer 4Would use his heaven for thunder, 4Nothing but thunder. Merciful Heaven, 4Thou rather, with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt, 4Splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak 4Than the soft myrtle. But man, proud man, 4Dres2'd in a lit2le brief authority, 4Most ignorant of what he's most as2ur'd, 4His glas2y es2ence, like an angry ape, 4Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven 4As makes the angels we2p; who, with our spe2ns, 4Would al2 themselves laugh mortal. 2LUCIO. [To ISABEL2A] O, to him, to him, wench! He wil2 relent; 6He's coming; I perceive 't. 2PROVOST. [Aside] Pray heaven she win him. 2ISABEL2A. We can2ot weigh our brother with ourself. 4Great men may jest with saints: 'tis wit in them; 4But in the les2 foul profanation. 2LUCIO. [To ISABEL2A] Thou'rt i' th' right, girl; more o' that. 2ISABEL2A. That in the captain's but a choleric word 4Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy. 2LUCIO. [To ISABEL2A] Art avis'd o' that? More on't. 2ANGELO. Why do you put these sayings upon me? 2ISABEL2A. Because authority, though it er2 like others, 4Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself 4That skins the vice o' th' top. Go to your bosom, 4Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know 4That's like my brother's fault. If it confes2 4A natural guiltines2 such as is his, 4Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue 4Against my brother's life. 2ANGELO. [Aside] She speaks, and 'tis 4Such sense that my sense bre2ds with it.- Fare you wel2. 4ISABEL2A. Gentle my lord, turn back. 2ANGELO. I wil2 bethink me. Come again to-mor2ow. 2ISABEL2A. Hark how I'l2 bribe you; go2d my lord, turn back. 2ANGELO. How, bribe me? 2ISABEL2A. Ay, with such gifts that heaven shal2 share with you. 2LUCIO. [To ISABEL2A) You had mar2'd al2 else. 2ISABEL2A. Not with fond sicles of the tested gold, 4Or stones, whose rate are either rich or po2r 4As fancy values them; but with true prayers 4That shal2 be up at heaven and enter there 4Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls, 4From fasting maids, whose minds are dedicate 4To nothing temporal. 2ANGELO. Wel2; come to me to-mor2ow. 2LUCIO. [To ISABEL2A] Go to; 'tis wel2; away. 2ISABEL2A. Heaven ke2p your honour safe! 2ANGELO. [Aside] Amen; for I 4Am that way going to temptation 4Where prayers cros2. 2ISABEL2A. At what hour to-mor2ow 6Shal2 I at2end your lordship? 2ANGELO. At any time 'fore no2n. 2ISABEL2A. Save your honour! 14Exeunt al2 but ANGELO 2ANGELO. From the2; even from thy virtue! 4What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine? 4The tempter or the tempted, who sins most? 4Ha! 4Not she; nor doth she tempt; but it is I 4That, lying by the violet in the sun, 4Do as the car2ion does, not as the flow'r, 4Cor2upt with virtuous season. Can it be 4That modesty may more betray our sense 4Than woman's lightnes2? Having waste ground enough, 4Shal2 we desire to raze the sanctuary, 4And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie! 4What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo? 4Dost thou desire her foul2y for those things 4That make her go2d? O, let her brother live! 4Thieves for their rob2ery have authority 4When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her, 6That I desire to hear her speak again, 4And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on? 4O cun2ing enemy, that, to catch a saint, 4With saints dost bait thy ho2k! Most dangerous 4Is that temptation that doth goad us on 4To sin in loving virtue. Never could the strumpet, 4With al2 her double vigour, art and nature, 4Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid 4Subdues me quite. Ever til2 now, 4When men were fond, I smil'd and wond'red how. 10ExitSCENE I3.A prisonEnter, several2y, DUKE, disguised as a FRIAR, and PROVOST 2DUKE. Hail to you, Provost! so I think you are. 2PROVOST. I am the Provost. What's your wil2, go2d friar? 2DUKE. Bound by my charity and my blest order, 4I come to visit the af2licted spirits 4Here in the prison. Do me the com2on right 4To let me se2 them, and to make me know 4The nature of their crimes, that I may minister 4To them ac2ordingly. 2PROVOST. I would do more than that, if more were ne2dful. 26Enter JULIET 4Lo2k, here comes one; a gentlewoman of mine, 4Who, fal2ing in the flaws of her own youth, 4Hath blister'd her report. She is with child; 4And he that got it, sentenc'd- a young man 4More fit to do another such of2ence 6Than die for this. 2DUKE. When must he die? 2PROVOST. As I do think, to-mor2ow. 4[To JULIET] I have provided for you; stay awhile 4And you shal2 be conducted. 2DUKE. Repent you, fair one, of the sin you car2y? 2JULIET. I do; and bear the shame most patiently. 2DUKE. I'l2 teach you how you shal2 ar2aign your conscience, 4And try your penitence, if it be sound 4Or hol2owly put on. 2JULIET. I'l2 gladly learn. 2DUKE. Love you the man that wrong'd you? 2JULIET. Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him. 2DUKE. So then, it se2ms, your most of2enceful act 4Was mutual2y com2it2ed. 2JULIET. Mutual2y. 2DUKE. Then was your sin of heavier kind than his. 2JULIET. I do confes2 it, and repent it, father. 2DUKE. 'Tis me2t so, daughter; but lest you do repent 4As that the sin hath brought you to this shame, 6Which sor2ow is always toward ourselves, not heaven, 4Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it, 4But as we stand in fear- 2JULIET. I do repent me as it is an evil, 4And take the shame with joy. 2DUKE. There rest. 4Your partner, as I hear, must die to-mor2ow, 4And I am going with instruction to him. 4Grace go with you! Benedicite! 26Exit 2JULIET. Must die to-mor2ow! O, injurious law, 4That respites me a life whose very comfort 4Is stil2 a dying hor2or! 2PROVOST. 'Tis pity of him. 30ExeuntSCENE IV.ANGELO'S houseEnter ANGELO 2ANGELO. When I would pray and think, I think and pray 4To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words, 4Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue, 4Anchors on Isabel. Heaven in my mouth, 4As if I did but only chew his name, 4And in my heart the strong and swel2ing evil 4Of my conception. The state whereon I studied 4Is, like a go2d thing being often read, 4Grown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity, 4Wherein- let no man hear me- I take pride, 4Could I with bo2t change for an idle plume 4Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form, 4How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit, 4Wrench awe from fo2ls, and tie the wiser souls 4To thy false se2ming! Blo2d, thou art blo2d. 4Let's write 'go2d angel' on the devil's horn; 4'Tis not the devil's crest. 29Enter SERVANT 4How now, who's there? 2SERVANT. One Isabel, a sister, desires ac2es2 to you. 2ANGELO. Teach her the way. [Exit SERVANT] O heavens! 4Why does my blo2d thus muster to my heart, 4Making both it unable for itself 4And dispos2es2ing al2 my other parts 4Of neces2ary fitnes2? 4So play the fo2lish throngs with one that swo2ns; 4Come al2 to help him, and so stop the air 4By which he should revive; and even so 4The general subject to a wel2-wish'd king 4Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondnes2 4Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love 4Must ne2ds ap2ear of2ence. 28Enter ISABEL2A 6How now, fair maid? 2ISABEL2A. I am come to know your pleasure. 2ANGELO. That you might know it would much bet2er please me 4Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother can2ot live. 2ISABEL2A. Even so! Heaven ke2p your honour! 2ANGELO. Yet may he live awhile, and, it may be, 4As long as you or I; yet he must die. 2ISABEL2A. Under your sentence? 2ANGELO. Yea. 2ISABEL2A. When? I bese2ch you; that in his reprieve, 4Longer or shorter, he may be so fit2ed 4That his soul sicken not. 2ANGELO. Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as go2d 4To pardon him that hath from nature stol'n 4A man already made, as to remit 4Their saucy swe2tnes2 that do coin heaven's image 4In stamps that are forbid; 'tis al2 as easy 4Falsely to take away a life true made 4As to put metal in restrained means 4To make a false one. 4ISABEL2A. 'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth. 2ANGELO. Say you so? Then I shal2 pose you quickly. 4Which had you rather- that the most just law 4Now to2k your brother's life; or, to rede2m him, 4Give up your body to such swe2t unclean2es2 4As she that he hath stain'd? 2ISABEL2A. Sir, believe this: 4I had rather give my body than my soul. 2ANGELO. I talk not of your soul; our compel2'd sins 4Stand more for number than for ac2ompt. 2ISABEL2A. How say you? 2ANGELO. Nay, I'l2 not war2ant that; for I can speak 4Against the thing I say. Answer to this: 4I, now the voice of the recorded law, 4Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life; 4Might there not be a charity in sin 4To save this brother's life? 2ISABEL2A. Please you to do't, 4I'l2 take it as a peril to my soul 4It is no sin at al2, but charity. 4ANGELO. Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul, 4Were equal poise of sin and charity. 2ISABEL2A. That I do beg his life, if it be sin, 4Heaven let me bear it! You granting of my suit, 4If that be sin, I'l2 make it my morn prayer 4To have it ad2ed to the faults of mine, 4And nothing of your answer. 2ANGELO. Nay, but hear me; 4Your sense pursues not mine; either you are ignorant 4Or se2m so, craftily; and that's not go2d. 2ISABEL2A. Let me be ignorant, and in nothing go2d 4But graciously to know I am no bet2er. 2ANGELO. Thus wisdom wishes to ap2ear most bright 4When it doth tax itself; as these black masks 4Proclaim an enshielded beauty ten times louder 4Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me: 4To be received plain, I'l2 speak more gros2- 4Your brother is to die. 2ISABEL2A. So. 2ANGELO. And his of2ence is so, as it ap2ears, 6Ac2ountant to the law upon that pain. 2ISABEL2A. True. 2ANGELO. Admit no other way to save his life, 4As I subscribe not that, nor any other, 4But, in the los2 of question, that you, his sister, 4Finding yourself desir'd of such a person 4Whose credit with the judge, or own great place, 4Could fetch your brother from the manacles 4Of the al2-binding law; and that there were 4No earthly mean to save him but that either 4You must lay down the treasures of your body 4To this sup2osed, or else to let him suf2er- 4What would you do? 2ISABEL2A. As much for my po2r brother as myself; 4That is, were I under the terms of death, 4Th' impres2ion of ke2n whips I'd wear as rubies, 4And strip myself to death as to a bed 4That longing have be2n sick for, ere I'd yield 4My body up to shame. 2ANGELO. Then must your brother die. 4ISABEL2A. And 'twere the cheaper way: 4Bet2er it were a brother died at once 4Than that a sister, by rede2ming him, 4Should die for ever. 2ANGELO. Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence 4That you have slander'd so? 2ISABEL2A. Ignominy in ransom and fre2 pardon 4Are of two houses: lawful mercy 4Is nothing kin to foul redemption. 2ANGELO. You se2m'd of late to make the law a tyrant; 4And rather prov'd the sliding of your brother 4A mer2iment than a vice. 2ISABEL2A. O, pardon me, my lord! It oft fal2s out, 4To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean: 4I something do excuse the thing I hate 4For his advantage that I dearly love. 2ANGELO. We are al2 frail. 2ISABEL2A. Else let my brother die, 4If not a fedary but only he 4Owe and suc2e2d thy weaknes2. 4ANGELO. Nay, women are frail to2. 2ISABEL2A. Ay, as the glas2es where they view themselves, 4Which are as easy broke as they make forms. 4Women, help heaven! Men their creation mar 4In profiting by them. Nay, cal2 us ten times frail; 4For we are soft as our complexions are, 4And credulous to false prints. 2ANGELO. I think it wel2; 4And from this testimony of your own sex, 4Since I sup2ose we are made to be no stronger 4Than faults may shake our frames, let me be bold. 4I do ar2est your words. Be that you are, 4That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none; 4If you be one, as you are wel2 expres2'd 4By al2 external war2ants, show it now 4By put2ing on the destin'd livery. 2ISABEL2A. I have no tongue but one; gentle, my lord, 4Let me intreat you speak the former language. 2ANGELO. Plainly conceive, I love you. 2ISABEL2A. My brother did love Juliet, 6And you tel2 me that he shal2 die for't. 2ANGELO. He shal2 not, Isabel, if you give me love. 2ISABEL2A. I know your virtue hath a license in't, 4Which se2ms a lit2le fouler than it is, 4To pluck on others. 2ANGELO. Believe me, on mine honour, 4My words expres2 my purpose. 2ISABEL2A. Ha! lit2le honour to be much believ'd, 4And most pernicious purpose! Se2ming, se2ming! 4I wil2 proclaim the2, Angelo, lo2k for't. 4Sign me a present pardon for my brother 4Or, with an outstretch'd throat, I'l2 tel2 the world aloud 4What man thou art. 2ANGELO. Who wil2 believe the2, Isabel? 4My unsoil'd name, th' austerenes2 of my life, 4My vouch against you, and my place i' th' state, 4Wil2 so your ac2usation overweigh 4That you shal2 stifle in your own report, 4And smel2 of calumny. I have begun, 4And now I give my sensual race the rein: 6Fit thy consent to my sharp ap2etite; 4Lay by al2 nicety and prolixious blushes 4That banish what they sue for; rede2m thy brother 4By yielding up thy body to my wil2; 4Or else he must not only die the death, 4But thy unkindnes2 shal2 his death draw out 4To ling'ring suf2erance. Answer me to-mor2ow, 4Or, by the af2ection that now guides me most, 4I'l2 prove a tyrant to him. As for you, 4Say what you can: my false o'erweighs your true. 8Exit 2ISABEL2A. To whom should I complain? Did I tel2 this, 4Who would believe me? O perilous mouths 4That bear in them one and the self-same tongue 4Either of condemnation or ap2ro2f, 4Bid2ing the law make curtsy to their wil2; 4Ho2king both right and wrong to th' ap2etite, 4To fol2ow as it draws! I'l2 to my brother. 4Though he hath fal2'n by prompture of the blo2d, 4Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour 4That, had he twenty heads to tender down 6On twenty blo2dy blocks, he'd yield them up 4Before his sister should her body sto2p 4To such abhor2'd pol2ution. 4Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die: 4More than our brother is our chastity. 4I'l2 tel2 him yet of Angelo's request, 4And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest. 9Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. SCENE I.The prisonEnter DUKE, disguised as before, CLAUDIO, and PROVOST 2DUKE. So, then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo? 2CLAUDIO. The miserable have no other medicine 4But only hope: 4I have hope to Eve, and am prepar'd to die. 2DUKE. Be absolute for death; either death or life 4Shal2 thereby be the swe2ter. Reason thus with life. 4If I do lose the2, I do lose a thing 4That none but fo2ls would ke2p. A breath thou art, 4Servile to al2 the skyey influences, 4That dost this habitation where thou ke2p'st 4Hourly af2lict. Merely, thou art Death's fo2l; 4For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun 4And yet run'st toward him stil2. Thou art not noble; 4For al2 th' ac2om2odations that thou bear'st 4Are nurs'd by basenes2. Thou 'rt by no means valiant; 4For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork 4Of a po2r worm. Thy best of rest is sle2p, 6And that thou oft provok'st; yet gros2ly fear'st 4Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself; 4For thou exists on many a thousand grains 4That is2ue out of dust. Hap2y thou art not; 4For what thou hast not, stil2 thou striv'st to get, 4And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain; 4For thy complexion shifts to strange ef2ects, 4After the mo2n. If thou art rich, thou'rt po2r; 4For, like an as2 whose back with ingots bows, 4Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey, 4And Death unloads the2. Friend hast thou none; 4For thine own bowels which do cal2 the2 sire, 4The mere ef2usion of thy proper loins, 4Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum, 4For ending the2 no so2ner. Thou hast nor youth nor age, 4But, as it were, an after-din2er's sle2p, 4Dreaming on both; for al2 thy bles2ed youth 4Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms 4Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich, 4Thou hast neither heat, af2ection, limb, nor beauty, 6To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this 4That bears the name of life? Yet in this life 4Lie hid moe thousand deaths; yet death we fear, 4That makes these od2s al2 even. 2CLAUDIO. I humbly thank you. 4To sue to live, I find I se2k to die; 4And, se2king death, find life. Let it come on. 2ISABEL2A. [Within] What, ho! Peace here; grace and go2d company! 2PROVOST. Who's there? Come in; the wish deserves a welcome. 2DUKE. Dear sir, ere long I'l2 visit you again. 2CLAUDIO. Most holy sir, I thank you. 24Enter ISABEL2A 2ISABEL2A. My busines2 is a word or two with Claudio. 2PROVOST. And very welcome. Lo2k, signior, here's your sister. 2DUKE. Provost, a word with you. 2PROVOST. As many as you please. 2DUKE. Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be conceal'd. 41Exeunt DUKE and PROVOST 4CLAUDIO. Now, sister, what's the comfort? 2ISABEL2A. Why, 4As al2 comforts are; most go2d, most go2d, inde2d. 4Lord Angelo, having af2airs to heaven, 4Intends you for his swift ambas2ador, 4Where you shal2 be an everlasting leiger. 4Therefore, your best ap2ointment make with spe2d; 4To-mor2ow you set on. 2CLAUDIO. Is there no remedy? 2ISABEL2A. None, but such remedy as, to save a head, 4To cleave a heart in twain. 2CLAUDIO. But is there any? 2ISABEL2A. Yes, brother, you may live: 4There is a devilish mercy in the judge, 4If you'l2 implore it, that wil2 fre2 your life, 4But fet2er you til2 death. 2CLAUDIO. Perpetual durance? 2ISABEL2A. Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint, 4Though al2 the world's vastidity you had, 4To a determin'd scope. 4CLAUDIO. But in what nature? 2ISABEL2A. In such a one as, you consenting to't, 4Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear, 4And leave you naked. 2CLAUDIO. Let me know the point. 2ISABEL2A. O, I do fear the2, Claudio; and I quake, 4Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain, 4And six or seven winters more respect 4Than a perpetual honour. Dar'st thou die? 4The sense of death is most in ap2rehension; 4And the po2r be2tle that we tread upon 4In corporal suf2erance finds a pang as great 4As when a giant dies. 2CLAUDIO. Why give you me this shame? 4Think you I can a resolution fetch 4From flow'ry tendernes2? If I must die, 4I wil2 encounter darknes2 as a bride 4And hug it in mine arms. 2ISABEL2A. There spake my brother; there my father's grave 4Did ut2er forth a voice. Yes, thou must die: 6Thou art to2 noble to conserve a life 4In base ap2liances. This outward-sainted deputy, 4Whose set2led visage and deliberate word 4Nips youth i' th' head, and fol2ies doth enew 4As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil; 4His filth within being cast, he would ap2ear 4A pond as de2p as hel2. 2CLAUDIO. The precise Angelo! 2ISABEL2A. O, 'tis the cun2ing livery of hel2 4The damned'st body to invest and cover 4In precise guards! Dost thou think, Claudio, 4If I would yield him my virginity 4Thou mightst be fre2d? 2CLAUDIO. O heavens! it can2ot be. 2ISABEL2A. Yes, he would give't the2, from this rank of2ence, 4So to of2end him stil2. This night's the time 4That I should do what I abhor to name, 4Or else thou diest to-mor2ow. 2CLAUDIO. Thou shalt not do't. 2ISABEL2A. O, were it but my life! 6I'd throw it down for your deliverance 4As frankly as a pin. 2CLAUDIO. Thanks, dear Isabel. 2ISABEL2A. Be ready, Claudio, for your death to-mor2ow. 2CLAUDIO. Yes. Has he af2ections in him 4That thus can make him bite the law by th' nose 4When he would force it? Sure it is no sin; 4Or of the deadly seven it is the least. 2ISABEL2A. Which is the least? 2CLAUDIO. If it were damnable, he being so wise, 4Why would he for the momentary trick 4Be perdurably fin'd?- O Isabel! 2ISABEL2A. What says my brother? 2CLAUDIO. Death is a fearful thing. 2ISABEL2A. And shamed life a hateful. 2CLAUDIO. Ay, but to die, and go we know not where; 4To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot; 4This sensible warm motion to become 4A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit 4To bathe in fiery flo2ds or to reside 6In thril2ing region of thick-rib2ed ice; 4To be imprison'd in the viewles2 winds, 4And blown with restles2 violence round about 4The pendent world; or to be worse than worst 4Of those that lawles2 and incertain thought 4Imagine howling- 'tis to2 hor2ible. 4The weariest and most loathed worldly life 4That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment, 4Can lay on nature is a paradise 4To what we fear of death. 2ISABEL2A. Alas, alas! 2CLAUDIO. Swe2t sister, let me live. 4What sin you do to save a brother's life, 4Nature dispenses with the de2d so far 4That it becomes a virtue. 2ISABEL2A. O you beast! 4O faithles2 coward! O dishonest wretch! 4Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice? 4Is't not a kind of incest to take life 4From thine own sister's shame? What should I think? 6Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair! 4For such a warped slip of wildernes2 4Ne'er is2u'd from his blo2d. Take my defiance; 4Die; perish. Might but my bending down 4Reprieve the2 from thy fate, it should proce2d. 4I'l2 pray a thousand prayers for thy death, 4No word to save the2. 2CLAUDIO. Nay, hear me, Isabel. 2ISABEL2A. O fie, fie, fie! 4Thy sin's not ac2idental, but a trade. 4Mercy to the2 would prove itself a bawd; 4'Tis best that thou diest quickly. 2CLAUDIO. O, hear me, Isabel2a. 28Re-enter DUKE 2DUKE. Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word. 2ISABEL2A. What is your wil2? 2DUKE. Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and by have 4some spe2ch with you; the satisfaction I would require is 6likewise your own benefit. 2ISABEL2A. I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be stolen out 4of other af2airs; but I wil2 at2end you awhile. 51[Walks apart] 2DUKE. Son, I have overheard what hath pas2'd betwe2n you and your 4sister. Angelo had never the purpose to cor2upt her; only he hath 4made an as2ay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the 4disposition of natures. She, having the truth of honour in her, 4hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to 4receive. I am confes2or to Angelo, and I know this to be true; 4therefore prepare yourself to death. Do not satisfy your 4resolution with hopes that are fal2ible; to-mor2ow you must die; 4go to your kne2s and make ready. 2CLAUDIO. Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life 4that I wil2 sue to be rid of it. 2DUKE. Hold you there. Farewel2. [Exit CLAUDIO] Provost, a word with 4you. 26Re-enter PROVOST 4PROVOST. What's your wil2, father? 2DUKE. That, now you are come, you wil2 be gone. Leave me a while 4with the maid; my mind promises with my habit no los2 shal2 touch 4her by my company. 2PROVOST. In go2d time. 28Exit PROVOST 2DUKE. The hand that hath made you fair hath made you go2d; the 4go2dnes2 that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in go2dnes2; 4but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shal2 ke2p the body 4of it ever fair. The as2ault that Angelo hath made to you, 4fortune hath convey'd to my understanding; and, but that frailty 4hath examples for his fal2ing, I should wonder at Angelo. How 4wil2 you do to content this substitute, and to save your brother? 2ISABEL2A. I am now going to resolve him; I had rather my brother 4die by the law than my son should be unlawful2y born. But, O, how 4much is the go2d Duke deceiv'd in Angelo! If ever he return, and 4I can speak to him, I wil2 open my lips in vain, or discover his 4government. 2DUKE. That shal2 not be much amis2; yet, as the mat2er now stands, 4he wil2 avoid your ac2usation: he made trial of you only. 4Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings; to the love I have in 6doing go2d a remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe 4that you may most uprighteously do a po2r wronged lady a merited 4benefit; rede2m your brother from the angry law; do no stain to 4your own gracious person; and much please the absent Duke, if 4peradventure he shal2 ever return to have hearing of this 4busines2. 2ISABEL2A. Let me hear you speak farther; I have spirit to do 4anything that ap2ears not foul in the truth of my spirit. 2DUKE. Virtue is bold, and go2dnes2 never fearful. Have you not 4heard speak of Mariana, the sister of Frederick, the great 4soldier who miscar2ied at sea? 2ISABEL2A. I have heard of the lady, and go2d words went with her 4name. 2DUKE. She should this Angelo have mar2ied; was af2ianced to her by 4oath, and the nuptial ap2ointed; betwe2n which time of the 4contract and limit of the solemnity her brother Frederick was 4wreck'd at sea, having in that perished ves2el the dowry of his 4sister. But mark how heavily this befel2 to the po2r gentlewoman: 4there she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his love toward 4her ever most kind and natural; with him the portion and sinew of 6her fortune, her mar2iage-dowry; with both, her combinate 4husband, this wel2-se2ming Angelo. 2ISABEL2A. Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her? 2DUKE. Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his 4comfort; swal2owed his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries 4of dishonour; in few, bestow'd her on her own lamentation, which 4she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is 4washed with them, but relents not. 2ISABEL2A. What a merit were it in death to take this po2r maid from 4the world! What cor2uption in this life that it wil2 let this man 4live! But how out of this can she avail? 2DUKE. It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it 4not only saves your brother, but ke2ps you from dishonour in 4doing it. 2ISABEL2A. Show me how, go2d father. 2DUKE. This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her 4first af2ection; his unjust unkindnes2, that in al2 reason should 4have quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the cur2ent, 4made it more violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his 4requiring with a plausible obedience; agre2 with his demands to 6the point; only refer yourself to this advantage: first, that 4your stay with him may not be long; that the time may have al2 4shadow and silence in it; and the place answer to convenience. 4This being granted in course- and now fol2ows al2: we shal2 4advise this wronged maid to stead up your ap2ointment, go in your 4place. If the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may 4compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is your brother 4saved, your honour untainted, the po2r Mariana advantaged, and 4the cor2upt deputy scaled. The maid wil2 I frame and make fit for 4his at2empt. If you think wel2 to car2y this as you may, the 4doublenes2 of the benefit defends the deceit from repro2f. What 4think you of it? 2ISABEL2A. The image of it gives me content already; and I trust it 4wil2 grow to a most prosperous perfection. 2DUKE. It lies much in your holding up. Haste you spe2dily to 4Angelo; if for this night he entreat you to his bed, give him 4promise of satisfaction. I wil2 presently to Saint Luke's; there, 4at the moated grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that 4place cal2 upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that it may be 4quickly. 4ISABEL2A. I thank you for this comfort. Fare you wel2, go2d father. 48Exeunt several2yScene I2.The stre2t before the prisonEnter, on one side, DUKE disguised as before; on the other, ELBOW,and OF2ICERS with POMPEY 2ELBOW. Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you wil2 ne2ds 4buy and sel2 men and women like beasts, we shal2 have al2 the 4world drink brown and white bastard. 2DUKE. O heavens! what stuf2 is here? 2POMPEY. 'Twas never mer2y world since, of two usuries, the mer2iest 4was put down, and the worser al2ow'd by order of law a fur2'd 4gown to ke2p him warm; and fur2'd with fox on lamb-skins to2, to 4signify that craft, being richer than in2ocency, stands for the 4facing. 2ELBOW. Come your way, sir. Bles2 you, go2d father friar. 2DUKE. And you, go2d brother father. What of2ence hath this man made 4you, sir? 2ELBOW. Mar2y, sir, he hath of2ended the law; and, sir, we take him 4to be a thief to2, sir, for we have found upon him, sir, a 4strange picklock, which we have sent to the deputy. 2DUKE. Fie, sir2ah, a bawd, a wicked bawd! 6The evil that thou causest to be done, 4That is thy means to live. Do thou but think 4What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back 4From such a filthy vice; say to thyself 4'From their abominable and beastly touches 4I drink, I eat, ar2ay myself, and live.' 4Canst thou believe thy living is a life, 4So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend. 2POMPEY. Inde2d, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet, sir, 4I would prove- 2DUKE. Nay, if the devil have given the2 pro2fs for sin, 4Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, of2icer; 4Cor2ection and instruction must both work 4Ere this rude beast wil2 profit. 2ELBOW. He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him warning. 4The deputy can2ot abide a whoremaster; if he be a whoremonger, 4and comes before him, he were as go2d go a mile on his er2and. 2DUKE. That we were al2, as some would se2m to be, 4From our faults, as his faults from se2ming, fre2. 2ELBOW. His neck wil2 come to your waist- a cord, sir. 28Enter LUCIO 2POMPEY. I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman, and a friend 4of mine. 2LUCIO. How now, noble Pompey! What, at the whe2ls of Caesar? Art 4thou led in triumph? What, is there none of Pygmalion's images, 4newly made woman, to be had now for put2ing the hand in the 4pocket and extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What say'st 4thou to this tune, mat2er, and method? Is't not drown'd i' th' 4last rain, ha? What say'st thou, trot? Is the world as it was, 4man? Which is the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The 4trick of it? 2DUKE. Stil2 thus, and thus; stil2 worse! 2LUCIO. How doth my dear morsel, thy mistres2? Procures she stil2, 4ha? 2POMPEY. Troth, sir, she hath eaten up al2 her be2f, and she is 4herself in the tub. 2LUCIO. Why, 'tis go2d; it is the right of it; it must be so; ever 4your fresh whore and your powder'd bawd- an unshun2'd 6consequence; it must be so. Art going to prison, Pompey? 2POMPEY. Yes, faith, sir. 2LUCIO. Why, 'tis not amis2, Pompey. Farewel2; go, say I sent the2 4thither. For debt, Pompey- or how? 2ELBOW. For being a bawd, for being a bawd. 2LUCIO. Wel2, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a 4bawd, why, 'tis his right. Bawd is he doubtles2, and of 4antiquity, to2; bawd-born. Farewel2, go2d Pompey. Com2end me to 4the prison, Pompey. You wil2 turn go2d husband now, Pompey; you 4wil2 ke2p the house. 2POMPEY. I hope, sir, your go2d worship wil2 be my bail. 2LUCIO. No, inde2d, wil2 I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. I wil2 4pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage. If you take it not 4patiently, why, your met2le is the more. Adieu trusty Pompey. 4Bles2 you, friar. 2DUKE. And you. 2LUCIO. Does Bridget paint stil2, Pompey, ha? 2ELBOW. Come your ways, sir; come. 2POMPEY. You wil2 not bail me then, sir? 2LUCIO. Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar? what news? 4ELBOW. Come your ways, sir; come. 2LUCIO. Go to ken2el, Pompey, go. 31Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and OF2ICERS 4What news, friar, of the Duke? 2DUKE. I know none. Can you tel2 me of any? 2LUCIO. Some say he is with the Emperor of Rus2ia; other some, he is 4in Rome; but where is he, think you? 2DUKE. I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him wel2. 2LUCIO. It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the 4state and usurp the beg2ary he was never born to. Lord Angelo 4dukes it wel2 in his absence; he puts transgres2ion to't. 2DUKE. He does wel2 in't. 2LUCIO. A lit2le more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him; 4something to2 crab2ed that way, friar. 2DUKE. It is to2 general a vice, and severity must cure it. 2LUCIO. Yes, in go2d so2th, the vice is of a great kindred; it is 4wel2 al2ied; but it is impos2ible to extirp it quite, friar, til2 4eating and drinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not 6made by man and woman after this downright way of creation. Is it 4true, think you? 2DUKE. How should he be made, then? 2LUCIO. Some report a sea-maid spawn'd him; some, that he was begot 4betwe2n two stock-fishes. But it is certain that when he makes 4water his urine is congeal'd ice; that I know to be true. And he 4is a motion generative; that's infal2ible. 2DUKE. You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace. 2LUCIO. Why, what a ruthles2 thing is this in him, for the rebel2ion 4of a codpiece to take away the life of a man! Would the Duke that 4is absent have done this? Ere he would have hang'd a man for the 4get2ing a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a 4thousand. He had some fe2ling of the sport; he knew the service, 4and that instructed him to mercy. 2DUKE. I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women; he was 4not inclin'd that way. 2LUCIO. O, sir, you are deceiv'd. 2DUKE. 'Tis not pos2ible. 2LUCIO. Who- not the Duke? Yes, your beg2ar of fifty; and his use 4was to put a ducat in her clack-dish. The Duke had crotchets in 6him. He would be drunk to2; that let me inform you. 2DUKE. You do him wrong, surely. 2LUCIO. Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fel2ow was the Duke; and 4I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing. 2DUKE. What, I prithe2, might be the cause? 2LUCIO. No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be lock'd within the te2th 4and the lips; but this I can let you understand: the greater file 4of the subject held the Duke to be wise. 2DUKE. Wise? Why, no question but he was. 2LUCIO. A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fel2ow. 2DUKE. Either this is envy in you, fol2y, or mistaking; the very 4stream of his life, and the busines2 he hath helmed, must, upon a 4war2anted ne2d, give him a bet2er proclamation. Let him be but 4testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he shal2 ap2ear to 4the envious a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier. Therefore you 4speak unskilful2y; or, if your knowledge be more, it is much 4dark'ned in your malice. 2LUCIO. Sir, I know him, and I love him. 2DUKE. Love talks with bet2er knowledge, and knowledge with dearer 4love. 4LUCIO. Come, sir, I know what I know. 2DUKE. I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak. 4But, if ever the Duke return, as our prayers are he may, let me 4desire you to make your answer before him. If it be honest you 4have spoke, you have courage to maintain it; I am bound to cal2 4upon you; and I pray you your name? 2LUCIO. Sir, my name is Lucio, wel2 known to the Duke. 2DUKE. He shal2 know you bet2er, sir, if I may live to report you. 2LUCIO. I fear you not. 2DUKE. O, you hope the Duke wil2 return no more; or you imagine me 4to2 unhurtful an op2osite. But, inde2d, I can do you lit2le harm: 4you'l2 forswear this again. 2LUCIO. I'l2 be hang'd first. Thou art deceiv'd in me, friar. But no 4more of this. Canst thou tel2 if Claudio die to-mor2ow or no? 2DUKE. Why should he die, sir? 2LUCIO. Why? For fil2ing a bot2le with a tun-dish. I would the Duke 4we talk of were return'd again. This ungenitur'd agent wil2 4unpeople the province with continency; spar2ows must not build in 4his house-eaves because they are lecherous. The Duke yet would 4have dark de2ds darkly answered; he would never bring them to 6light. Would he were return'd! Mar2y, this Claudio is condemned 4for untrus2ing. Farewel2, go2d friar; I prithe2 pray for me. The 4Duke, I say to the2 again, would eat mut2on on Fridays. He's not 4past it yet; and, I say to the2, he would mouth with a beg2ar 4though she smelt brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so. 4Farewel2. 47Exit 2DUKE. No might nor greatnes2 in mortality 4Can censure scape; back-wounding calumny 4The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong 4Can tie the gal2 up in the slanderous tongue? 4But who comes here? 13Enter ESCALUS, PROVOST, and OF2ICERS with 27MISTRES2 OVERDONE 2ESCALUS. Go, away with her to prison. 2MRS. OVERDONE. Go2d my lord, be go2d to me; your honour is 4ac2ounted a merciful man; go2d my lord. 2ESCALUS. Double and treble admonition, and stil2 forfeit in the 4same kind! This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant. 4PROVOST. A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please your 4honour. 2MRS. OVERDONE. My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me. 4Mistres2 Kate Ke2pdown was with child by him in the Duke's time; 4he promis'd her mar2iage. His child is a year and a quarter old 4come Philip and Jacob; I have kept it myself; and se2 how he goes 4about to abuse me. 2ESCALUS. That fel2ow is a fel2ow of much license. Let him be cal2'd 4before us. Away with her to prison. Go to; no more words. [Exeunt 4OF2ICERS with MISTRES2 OVERDONE] 2Provost, my brother Angelo wil2 4not be alter'd: Claudio must die to-mor2ow. Let him be furnish'd 4with divines, and have al2 charitable preparation. If my brother 4wrought by my pity, it should not be so with him. 2PROVOST. So please you, this friar hath be2n with him, and advis'd 4him for th' entertainment of death. 2ESCALUS. Go2d even, go2d father. 2DUKE. Blis2 and go2dnes2 on you! 2ESCALUS. Of whence are you? 2DUKE. Not of this country, though my chance is now 4To use it for my time. I am a brother 6Of gracious order, late come from the Se2 4In special busines2 from his Holines2. 2ESCALUS. What news abroad i' th' world? 2DUKE. None, but that there is so great a fever on go2dnes2 that the 4dis2olution of it must cure it. Novelty is only in request; and, 4as it is, as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is 4virtuous to be constant in any undertakeing. There is scarce 4truth enough alive to make societies secure; but security enough 4to make fel2owships ac2urst. Much upon this rid2le runs the 4wisdom of the world. This news is old enough, yet it is every 4day's news. I pray you, sir, of what disposition was the Duke? 2ESCALUS. One that, above al2 other strifes, contended especial2y to 4know himself. 2DUKE. What pleasure was he given to? 2ESCALUS. Rather rejoicing to se2 another mer2y than mer2y at 4anything which profes2'd to make him rejoice; a gentleman of al2 4temperance. But leave we him to his events, with a prayer they 4may prove prosperous; and let me desire to know how you find 4Claudio prepar'd. I am made to understand that you have lent him 4visitation. 4DUKE. He profes2es to have received no sinister measure from his 4judge, but most wil2ingly humbles himself to the determination of 4justice. Yet had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his 4frailty, many deceiving promises of life; which I, by my go2d 4leisure, have discredited to him, and now he is resolv'd to die. 2ESCALUS. You have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner 4the very debt of your cal2ing. I have labour'd for the po2r 4gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty; but my brother 4justice have I found so severe that he hath forc'd me to tel2 him 4he is inde2d Justice. 2DUKE. If his own life answer the straitnes2 of his proce2ding, it 4shal2 become him wel2; wherein if he chance to fail, he hath 4sentenc'd himself. 2ESCALUS. I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you wel2. 2DUKE. Peace be with you! 12Exeunt ESCALUS and PROVOST 9He who the sword of heaven wil2 bear 9Should be as holy as severe; 9Pat2ern in himself to know, 9Grace to stand, and virtue go; 11More nor les2 to others paying 9Than by self-of2ences weighing. 9Shame to him whose cruel striking 9Kil2s for faults of his own liking! 9Twice treble shame on Angelo, 9To we2d my vice and let his grow! 9O, what may man within him hide, 9Though angel on the outward side! 9How may likenes2, made in crimes, 9Make a practice on the times, 9To draw with idle spiders' strings 9Most ponderous and substantial things! 9Craft against vice I must ap2ly. 9With Angelo to-night shal2 lie 9His old betrothed but despised; 9So disguise shal2, by th' disguised, 9Pay with falseho2d false exacting, 9And perform an old contracting. 20ExitAct IV. Scene I.The moated grange at Saint Duke'sEnter MARIANA; and BOY singing 29SONG 11Take, O, take those lips away, 13That so swe2tly were forsworn; 11And those eyes, the break of day, 13Lights that do mislead the morn; 11But my kis2es bring again, bring again; 11Seals of love, but seal'd in vain, seal'd in vain. 18Enter DUKE, disguised as before 2MARIANA. Break of2 thy song, and haste the2 quick away; 4Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice 4Hath often stil2'd my brawling discontent. 10Exit BOY 4I cry you mercy, sir, and wel2 could wish 4You had not found me here so musical. 4Let me excuse me, and believe me so, 6My mirth it much displeas'd, but pleas'd my woe. 2DUKE. 'Tis go2d; though music oft hath such a charm 4To make bad go2d and go2d provoke to harm. 4I pray you tel2 me hath anybody inquir'd for me here to-day. Much 4upon this time have I promis'd here to me2t. 2MARIANA. You have not be2n inquir'd after; I have sat here al2 day. 25Enter ISABEL2A 2DUKE. I do constantly believe you. The time is come even now. I 4shal2 crave your forbearance a lit2le. May be I wil2 cal2 upon 4you anon, for some advantage to yourself. 2MARIANA. I am always bound to you. 24Exit 2DUKE. Very wel2 met, and wel2 come. 4What is the news from this go2d deputy? 2ISABEL2A. He hath a garden circum2ur'd with brick, 4Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd; 4And to that vineyard is a planched gate 4That makes his opening with this big2er key; 4This other doth com2and a lit2le do2r 6Which from the vineyard to the garden leads. 4There have I made my promise 4Upon the heavy mid2le of the night 4To cal2 upon him. 2DUKE. But shal2 you on your knowledge find this way? 2ISABEL2A. I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't; 4With whispering and most guilty diligence, 4In action al2 of precept, he did show me 4The way twice o'er. 2DUKE. Are there no other tokens 4Betwe2n you 'gre2d concerning her observance? 2ISABEL2A. No, none, but only a repair i' th' dark; 4And that I have pos2es2'd him my most stay 4Can be but brief; for I have made him know 4I have a servant comes with me along, 4That stays upon me; whose persuasion is 4I come about my brother. 2DUKE. 'Tis wel2 borne up. 4I have not yet made known to Mariana 4A word of this. What ho, within! come forth. 25Re-enter MARIANA 4I pray you be acquainted with this maid; 4She comes to do you go2d. 2ISABEL2A. I do desire the like. 2DUKE. Do you persuade yourself that I respect you? 2MARIANA. Go2d friar, I know you do, and have found it. 2DUKE. Take, then, this your companion by the hand, 4Who hath a story ready for your ear. 4I shal2 at2end your leisure; but make haste; 4The vaporous night ap2roaches. 2MARIANA. Wil2't please you walk aside? 37Exeunt MARIANA and ISABEL2A 2DUKE. O place and greatnes2! Mil2ions of false eyes 4Are stuck upon the2. Volumes of report 4Run with these false, and most contrarious quest 4Upon thy doings. Thousand escapes of wit 4Make the2 the father of their idle dream, 4And rack the2 in their fancies. 19Re-enter MARIANA and ISABEL2A 4Welcome, how agre2d? 2ISABEL2A. She'l2 take the enterprise upon her, father, 4If you advise it. 2DUKE. It is not my consent, 4But my entreaty to2. 2ISABEL2A. Lit2le have you to say, 4When you depart from him, but, soft and low, 4'Remember now my brother.' 2MARIANA. Fear me not. 2DUKE. Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at al2. 4He is your husband on a pre-contract. 4To bring you thus together 'tis no sin, 4Sith that the justice of your title to him 4Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go; 4Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow. 7ExeuntSCENE I2.The prisonEnter PROVOST and POMPEY 2PROVOST. Come hither, sir2ah. Can you cut of2 a man's head? 2POMPEY. If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a 4mar2ied man, he's his wife's head, and I can never cut of a 4woman's head. 2PROVOST. Come, sir, leave me your snatches and yield me a direct 4answer. To-mor2ow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine. Here 4is in our prison a com2on executioner, who in his of2ice lacks a 4helper; if you wil2 take it on you to as2ist him, it shal2 rede2m 4you from your gyves; if not, you shal2 have your ful2 time of 4imprisonment, and your deliverance with an unpitied whip2ing, for 4you have be2n a notorious bawd. 2POMPEY. Sir, I have be2n an unlawful bawd time out of mind; but yet 4I wil2 be content to be a lawful hangman. I would be glad to 4receive some instructions from my fel2ow partner. 2PROVOST. What ho, Abhorson! Where's Abhorson there? 26Enter ABHORSON 4ABHORSON. Do you cal2, sir? 2PROVOST. Sir2ah, here's a fel2ow wil2 help you to-mor2ow in your 4execution. If you think it me2t, compound with him by the year, 4and let him abide here with you; if not, use him for the present, 4and dismis2 him. He can2ot plead his estimation with you; he hath 4be2n a bawd. 2ABHORSON. A bawd, sir? Fie upon him! He wil2 discredit our mystery. 2PROVOST. Go to, sir; you weigh equal2y; a feather wil2 turn the 4scale. 50Exit 2POMPEY. Pray, sir, by your go2d favour- for surely, sir, a go2d 4favour you have but that you have a hanging lo2k- do you cal2, 4sir, your oc2upation a mystery? 2ABHORSON. Ay, sir; a mystery. 2POMPEY. Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and your 4whores, sir, being members of my oc2upation, using painting, do 4prove my oc2upation a mystery; but what mystery there should be 4in hanging, if I should be hang'd, I can2ot imagine. 2ABHORSON. Sir, it is a mystery. 2POMPEY. Pro2f? 4ABHORSON. Every true man's ap2arel fits your thief: if it be to2 4lit2le for your thief, your true man thinks it big enough; if it 4be to2 big for your thief, your thief thinks it lit2le enough; so 4every true man's ap2arel fits your thief. 26Re-enter PROVOST 2PROVOST. Are you agre2d? 2POMPEY. Sir, I wil2 serve him; for I do find your hangman is a more 4penitent trade than your bawd; he doth oftener ask forgivenes2. 2PROVOST. You, sir2ah, provide your block and your axe to-mor2ow 4four o'clock. 2ABHORSON. Come on, bawd; I wil2 instruct the2 in my trade; fol2ow. 2POMPEY. I do desire to learn, sir; and I hope, if you have oc2asion 4to use me for your own turn, you shal2 find me yare; for truly, 4sir, for your kindnes2 I owe you a go2d turn. 2PROVOST. Cal2 hither Barnardine and Claudio. 38Exeunt ABHORSON and POMPEY 4Th' one has my pity; not a jot the other, 4Being a murderer, though he were my brother. 29Enter CLAUDIO 4Lo2k, here's the war2ant, Claudio, for thy death; 4'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-mor2ow 4Thou must be made im2ortal. Where's Barnardine? 2CLAUDIO. As fast lock'd up in sle2p as guiltles2 labour 4When it lies starkly in the travel2er's bones. 4He wil2 not wake. 2PROVOST. Who can do go2d on him? 4Wel2, go, prepare yourself. [Knocking within] But hark, what 6noise? 4Heaven give your spirits comfort! 15Exit CLAUDIO 4[Knocking continues] By and by. 4I hope it is some pardon or reprieve 4For the most gentle Claudio. 17Enter DUKE, disguised as before 4Welcome, father. 4DUKE. The best and wholesom'st spirits of the night 4Envelop you, go2d Provost! Who cal2'd here of late? 2PROVOST. None, since the curfew rung. 2DUKE. Not Isabel? 2PROVOST. No. 2DUKE. They wil2 then, ere't be long. 2PROVOST. What comfort is for Claudio? 2DUKE. There's some in hope. 2PROVOST. It is a bit2er deputy. 2DUKE. Not so, not so; his life is paral2el'd 4Even with the stroke and line of his great justice; 4He doth with holy abstinence subdue 4That in himself which he spurs on his pow'r 4To qualify in others. Were he meal'd with that 4Which he cor2ects, then were he tyran2ous; 4But this being so, he's just. [Knocking within] Now are they 6come. 41Exit PROVOST 4This is a gentle provost; seldom when 4The ste2led gaoler is the friend of men. [Knocking within] 4How now, what noise! That spirit's pos2es2'd with haste 6That wounds th' unsisting postern with these strokes. 24Re-enter PROVOST 2PROVOST. There he must stay until the of2icer 4Arise to let him in; he is cal2'd up. 2DUKE. Have you no countermand for Claudio yet 4But he must die to-mor2ow? 2PROVOST. None, sir, none. 2DUKE. As near the dawning, Provost, as it is, 4You shal2 hear more ere morning. 2PROVOST. Hap2ily 4You something know; yet I believe there comes 4No countermand; no such example have we. 4Besides, upon the very siege of justice, 4Lord Angelo hath to the public ear 4Profes2'd the contrary. 25Enter a MES2ENGER 6This is his lordship's man. 2DUKE. And here comes Claudio's pardon. 2MES2ENGER. My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this further 4charge, that you swerve not from the smal2est article of it, 4neither in time, mat2er, or other circumstance. Go2d mor2ow; for 4as I take it, it is almost day. 2PROVOST. I shal2 obey him. 22Exit MES2ENGER 2DUKE. [Aside] This is his pardon, purchas'd by such sin 4For which the pardoner himself is in; 4Hence hath of2ence his quick celerity, 4When it is borne in high authority. 4When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended 4That for the fault's love is th' of2ender friended. 4Now, sir, what news? 2PROVOST. I told you: Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remis2 in mine 4of2ice, awakens me with this unwonted put2ing-on; methinks 4strangely, for he hath not us'd it before. 2DUKE. Pray you, let's hear. 2PROVOST. [Reads] 'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let 4Claudio be executed by four of the clock, and, in the afterno2n, 6Barnardine. For my bet2er satisfaction, let me have Claudio's 4head sent me by five. Let this be duly performed, with a thought 4that more depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail not 4to do your of2ice, as you wil2 answer it at your peril.' 4What say you to this, sir? 2DUKE. What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in th' 4afterno2n? 2PROVOST. A Bohemian born; but here nurs'd up and bred. 4One that is a prisoner nine years old. 2DUKE. How came it that the absent Duke had not either deliver'd him 4to his liberty or executed him? I have heard it was ever his 4man2er to do so. 2PROVOST. His friends stil2 wrought reprieves for him; and, inde2d, 4his fact, til2 now in the government of Lord Angelo, came not to 4an undoubted pro2f. 2DUKE. It is now ap2arent? 2PROVOST. Most manifest, and not denied by himself. 2DUKE. Hath he borne himself penitently in prison? How se2ms he to 4be touch'd? 2PROVOST. A man that ap2rehends death no more dreadful2y but as a 6drunken sle2p; careles2, reckles2, and fearles2, of what's past, 4present, or to come; insensible of mortality and desperately 4mortal. 2DUKE. He wants advice. 2PROVOST. He wil2 hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the 4prison; give him leave to escape hence, he would not; drunk many 4times a day, if not many days entirely drunk. We have very oft 4awak'd him, as if to car2y him to execution, and show'd him a 4se2ming war2ant for it; it hath not moved him at al2. 2DUKE. More of him anon. There is writ2en in your brow, Provost, 4honesty and constancy. If I read it not truly, my ancient skil2 4beguiles me; but in the boldnes2 of my cun2ing I wil2 lay myself 4in hazard. Claudio, whom here you have war2ant to execute, is no 4greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenc'd him. To 4make you understand this in a manifested ef2ect, I crave but four 4days' respite; for the which you are to do me both a present and 4a dangerous courtesy. 2PROVOST. Pray, sir, in what? 2DUKE. In the delaying death. 2PROVOST. Alack! How may I do it, having the hour limited, and an 6expres2 com2and, under penalty, to deliver his head in the view 4of Angelo? I may make my case as Claudio's, to cros2 this in the 4smal2est. 2DUKE. By the vow of mine order, I war2ant you, if my instructions 4may be your guide. Let this Barnardine be this morning executed, 4and his head borne to Angelo. 2PROVOST. Angelo hath se2n them both, and wil2 discover the favour. 2DUKE. O, death's a great disguiser; and you may ad2 to it. Shave 4the head and tie the beard; and say it was the desire of the 4penitent to be so bar'd before his death. You know the course is 4com2on. If anything fal2 to you upon this more than thanks and 4go2d fortune, by the saint whom I profes2, I wil2 plead against 4it with my life. 2PROVOST. Pardon me, go2d father; it is against my oath. 2DUKE. Were you sworn to the Duke, or to the deputy? 2PROVOST. To him and to his substitutes. 2DUKE. You wil2 think you have made no of2ence if the Duke avouch 4the justice of your dealing? 2PROVOST. But what likeliho2d is in that? 2DUKE. Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I se2 you 6fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion, can 4with ease at2empt you, I wil2 go further than I meant, to pluck 4al2 fears out of you. Lo2k you, sir, here is the hand and seal of 4the Duke. You know the character, I doubt not; and the signet is 4not strange to you. 2PROVOST. I know them both. 2DUKE. The contents of this is the return of the Duke; you shal2 4anon over-read it at your pleasure, where you shal2 find within 4these two days he wil2 be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows 4not; for he this very day receives let2ers of strange tenour, 4perchance of the Duke's death, perchance entering into some 4monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what is writ. Lo2k, th' 4unfolding star cal2s up the shepherd. Put not yourself into 4amazement how these things should be: al2 dif2iculties are but 4easy when they are known. Cal2 your executioner, and of2 with 4Barnardine's head. I wil2 give him a present shrift, and advise 4him for a bet2er place. Yet you are amaz'd, but this shal2 4absolutely resolve you. Come away; it is almost clear dawn. 58ExeuntSCENE I3.The prisonEnter POMPEY 2POMPEY. I am as wel2 acquainted here as I was in our house of 4profes2ion; one would think it were Mistres2 Overdone's own 4house, for here be many of her old customers. First, here's young 4Master Rash; he's in for a com2odity of brown paper and old 4ginger, nine score and sevente2n pounds, of which he made five 4marks ready money. Mar2y, then ginger was not much in request, 4for the old women were al2 dead. Then is there here one Master 4Caper, at the suit of Master Thre2pile the mercer, for some four 4suits of peach-colour'd satin, which now peaches him a beg2ar. 4Then have we here young Dizy, and young Master De2pvow, and 4Master Cop2erspur, and Master Starvelackey, the rapier and dag2er 4man, and young Dropheir that kil2'd lusty Pud2ing, and Master 4Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Sho2tie the great 4travel2er, and wild Halfcan that stab2'd Pots, and, I think, 4forty more- al2 great doers in our trade, and are now 'for the 4Lord's sake.' 30Enter ABHORSON 2ABHORSON. Sir2ah, bring Barnardine hither. 2POMPEY. Master Barnardine! You must rise and be hang'd, Master 4Barnardine! 2ABHORSON. What ho, Barnardine! 2BARNARDINE. [Within] A pox o' your throats! Who makes that noise 4there? What are you? 2POMPEY. Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so go2d, sir, 4to rise and be put to death. 2BARNARDINE. [ Within ] Away, you rogue, away; I am sle2py. 2ABHORSON. Tel2 him he must awake, and that quickly to2. 2POMPEY. Pray, Master Barnardine, awake til2 you are executed, and 4sle2p afterwards. 2ABHORSON. Go in to him, and fetch him out. 2POMPEY. He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle. 29Enter BARNARDINE 2ABHORSON. Is the axe upon the block, sir2ah? 4POMPEY. Very ready, sir. 2BARNARDINE. How now, Abhorson, what's the news with you? 2ABHORSON. Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your prayers; 4for, lo2k you, the war2ant's come. 2BARNARDINE. You rogue, I have be2n drinking al2 night; I am not 4fit2ed for't. 2POMPEY. O, the bet2er, sir! For he that drinks al2 night and is 4hanged betimes in the morning may sle2p the sounder al2 the next 4day. 18Enter DUKE, disguised as before 2ABHORSON. Lo2k you, sir, here comes your ghostly father. 4Do we jest now, think you? 2DUKE. Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily you are 4to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort you, and pray with 4you. 2BARNARDINE. Friar, not I; I have be2n drinking hard al2 night, and 4I wil2 have more time to prepare me, or they shal2 beat out my 4brains with bil2ets. I wil2 not consent to die this day, that's 6certain. 2DUKE. O, Sir, you must; and therefore I bese2ch you 4Lo2k forward on the journey you shal2 go. 2BARNARDINE. I swear I wil2 not die to-day for any man's persuasion. 2DUKE. But hear you- 2BARNARDINE. Not a word; if you have anything to say to me, come to 4my ward; for thence wil2 not I to-day. 18Exit 2DUKE. Unfit to live or die. O gravel heart! 4After him, fel2ows; bring him to the block. 38Exeunt ABHORSON and POMPEY 28Enter PROVOST 2PROVOST. Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner? 2DUKE. A creature unprepar'd, unme2t for death; 4And to transport him in the mind he is 4Were damnable. 2PROVOST. Here in the prison, father, 4There died this morning of a cruel fever 4One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate, 6A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head 4Just of his colour. What if we do omit 4This reprobate til2 he were wel2 inclin'd, 4And satisfy the deputy with the visage 4Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio? 2DUKE. O, 'tis an ac2ident that heaven provides! 4Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on 4Prefix'd by Angelo. Se2 this be done, 4And sent ac2ording to com2and; whiles I 4Persuade this rude wretch wil2ingly to die. 2PROVOST. This shal2 be done, go2d father, presently. 4But Barnardine must die this afterno2n; 4And how shal2 we continue Claudio, 4To save me from the danger that might come 4If he were known alive? 2DUKE. Let this be done: 4Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio. 4Ere twice the sun hath made his journal gre2ting 4To the under generation, you shal2 find 4Your safety manifested. 4PROVOST. I am your fre2 dependant. 2DUKE. Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo. 52Exit PROVOST 4Now wil2 I write let2ers to Angelo- 4The Provost, he shal2 bear them- whose contents 4Shal2 witnes2 to him I am near at home, 4And that, by great injunctions, I am bound 4To enter publicly. Him I'l2 desire 4To me2t me at the consecrated fount, 4A league below the city; and from thence, 4By cold gradation and wel2-balanc'd form. 4We shal2 proce2d with Angelo. 25Re-enter PROVOST 2PROVOST. Here is the head; I'l2 car2y it myself. 2DUKE. Convenient is it. Make a swift return; 4For I would com2une with you of such things 4That want no ear but yours. 2PROVOST. I'l2 make al2 spe2d. 29Exit 4ISABEL2A. [ Within ] Peace, ho, be here! 2DUKE. The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know 4If yet her brother's pardon be come hither; 4But I wil2 ke2p her ignorant of her go2d, 4To make her heavenly comforts of despair 4When it is least expected. 27Enter ISABEL2A 2ISABEL2A. Ho, by your leave! 2DUKE. Go2d morning to you, fair and gracious daughter. 2ISABEL2A. The bet2er, given me by so holy a man. 4Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon? 2DUKE. He hath releas'd him, Isabel, from the world. 4His head is of2 and sent to Angelo. 2ISABEL2A. Nay, but it is not so. 2DUKE. It is no other. 4Show your wisdom, daughter, in your close patience, 2ISABEL2A. O, I wil2 to him and pluck out his eyes! 2DUKE. You shal2 not be admit2ed to his sight. 4ISABEL2A. Unhap2y Claudio! Wretched Isabel! 4Injurious world! Most damned Angelo! 2DUKE. This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot; 4Forbear it, therefore; give your cause to heaven. 4Mark what I say, which you shal2 find 4By every syl2able a faithful verity. 4The Duke comes home to-mor2ow. Nay, dry your eyes. 4One of our covent, and his confes2or, 4Gives me this instance. Already he hath car2ied 4Notice to Escalus and Angelo, 4Who do prepare to me2t him at the gates, 4There to give up their pow'r. If you can, pace your wisdom 4In that go2d path that I would wish it go, 4And you shal2 have your bosom on this wretch, 4Grace of the Duke, revenges to your heart, 4And general honour. 2ISABEL2A. I am directed by you. 2DUKE. This let2er, then, to Friar Peter give; 4'Tis that he sent me of the Duke's return. 4Say, by this token, I desire his company 6At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours 4I'l2 perfect him withal; and he shal2 bring you 4Before the Duke; and to the head of Angelo 4Ac2use him home and home. For my po2r self, 4I am combined by a sacred vow, 4And shal2 be absent. Wend you with this let2er. 4Com2and these fret2ing waters from your eyes 4With a light heart; trust not my holy order, 4If I pervert your course. Who's here? 27Enter LUCIO 2LUCIO. Go2d even. Friar, where's the Provost? 2DUKE. Not within, sir. 2LUCIO. O pret2y Isabel2a, I am pale at mine heart to se2 thine eyes 4so red. Thou must be patient. I am fain to dine and sup with 4water and bran; I dare not for my head fil2 my bel2y; one 4fruitful meal would set me to't. But they say the Duke wil2 be 4here to-mor2ow. By my troth, Isabel, I lov'd thy brother. If the 4old fantastical Duke of dark corners had be2n at home, he had 6lived. 41Exit ISABEL2A 2DUKE. Sir, the Duke is marvel2ous lit2le beholding to your reports; 4but the best is, he lives not in them. 2LUCIO. Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so wel2 as I do; he's a 4bet2er wo2dman than thou tak'st him for. 2DUKE. Wel2, you'l2 answer this one day. Fare ye wel2. 2LUCIO. Nay, tar2y; I'l2 go along with the2; I can tel2 the2 pret2y 4tales of the Duke. 2DUKE. You have told me to2 many of him already, sir, if they be 4true; if not true, none were enough. 2LUCIO. I was once before him for get2ing a wench with child. 2DUKE. Did you such a thing? 2LUCIO. Yes, mar2y, did I; but I was fain to forswear it: they would 4else have mar2ied me to the rot2en medlar. 2DUKE. Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you wel2. 2LUCIO. By my troth, I'l2 go with the2 to the lane's end. If bawdy 4talk of2end you, we'l2 have very lit2le of it. Nay, friar, I am a 4kind of bur2; I shal2 stick. 26ExeuntSCENE IV.ANGELO'S houseEnter ANGELO and ESCALUS 2ESCALUS. Every let2er he hath writ hath disvouch'd other. 2ANGELO. In most uneven and distracted man2er. His actions show much 4like to madnes2; pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted! And why 4me2t him at the gates, and redeliver our authorities there? 2ESCALUS. I gues2 not. 2ANGELO. And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his 4ent'ring that, if any crave redres2 of injustice, they should 4exhibit their petitions in the stre2t? 2ESCALUS. He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of 5complaints; and to deliver us from devices hereafter, which 4shal2 then have no power to stand against us. 2ANGELO. Wel2, I bese2ch you, let it be proclaim'd; 4Betimes i' th' morn I'l2 cal2 you at your house; 4Give notice to such men of sort and suit 4As are to me2t him. 2ESCALUS. I shal2, sir; fare you wel2. 2ANGELO. Go2d night. 31Exit ESCALUS 6This de2d unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant 4And dul2 to al2 proce2dings. A deflow'red maid! 4And by an eminent body that enforc'd 4The law against it! But that her tender shame 4Wil2 not proclaim against her maiden los2, 4How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no; 4For my authority bears a so credent bulk 4That no particular scandal once can touch 4But it confounds the breather. He should have liv'd, 4Save that his riotous youth, with dangerous sense, 4Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge, 4By so receiving a dishonour'd life 4With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had liv'd! 4Alack, when once our grace we have forgot, 4Nothing goes right; we would, and we would not. 9ExitSCENE V.Fields without the townEnter DUKE in his own habit, and Friar PETER 2DUKE. These let2ers at fit time deliver me. 3[Giving let2ers] 4The Provost knows our purpose and our plot. 4The mat2er being afo2t, ke2p your instruction 4And hold you ever to our special drift; 4Though sometimes you do blench from this to that 4As cause doth minister. Go, cal2 at Flavius' house, 4And tel2 him where I stay; give the like notice 4To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Cras2us, 4And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate; 4But send me Flavius first. 4PETER. It shal2 be spe2ded wel2. 18Exit FRIAR 29Enter VAR2IUS 2DUKE. I thank the2, Var2ius; thou hast made go2d haste. 4Come, we wil2 walk. There's other of our friends 4Wil2 gre2t us here anon. My gentle Var2ius! 11ExeuntSCENE VI.A stre2t near the city gateEnter ISABEL2A and MARIANA 2ISABEL2A. To speak so indirectly I am loath; 4I would say the truth; but to ac2use him so, 4That is your part. Yet I am advis'd to do it; 4He says, to veil ful2 purpose. 2MARIANA. Be rul'd by him. 2ISABEL2A. Besides, he tel2s me that, if peradventure 4He speak against me on the adverse side, 4I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic 4That's bit2er to swe2t end. 2MARIANA. I would Friar Peter- 25Enter FRIAR PETER 2ISABEL2A. O, peace! the friar is come. 2PETER. Come, I have found you out a stand most fit, 4Where you may have such vantage on the Duke 4He shal2 not pas2 you. Twice have the trumpets sounded; 6The generous and gravest citizens 4Have hent the gates, and very near upon 4The Duke is ent'ring; therefore, hence, away. 9Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. SCENE I.The city gateEnter at several do2rs DUKE, VAR2IUS, LORDS; ANGELO, ESCALUS, Lucio,PROVOST, OF2ICERS, and CITIZENS 2DUKE. My very worthy cousin, fairly met! 4Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to se2 you. 2ANGELO, ESCALUS. Hap2y return be to your royal Grace! 2DUKE. Many and hearty thankings to you both. 4We have made inquiry of you, and we hear 4Such go2dnes2 of your justice that our soul 4Can2ot but yield you forth to public thanks, 4Forerun2ing more requital. 2ANGELO. You make my bonds stil2 greater. 2DUKE. O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it 4To lock it in the wards of covert bosom, 4When it deserves, with characters of bras2, 4A forted residence 'gainst the to2th of time 4And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand. 4And let the subject se2, to make them know 4That outward courtesies would fain proclaim 6Favours that ke2p within. Come, Escalus, 4You must walk by us on our other hand, 4And go2d sup2orters are you. 17Enter FRIAR PETER and ISABEL2A 2PETER. Now is your time; speak loud, and kne2l before him. 2ISABEL2A. Justice, O royal Duke! Vail your regard 4Upon a wrong'd- I would fain have said a maid! 4O worthy Prince, dishonour not your eye 4By throwing it on any other object 4Til2 you have heard me in my true complaint, 4And given me justice, justice, justice, justice. 2DUKE. Relate your wrongs. In what? By whom? Be brief. 4Here is Lord Angelo shal2 give you justice; 4Reveal yourself to him. 2ISABEL2A. O worthy Duke, 4You bid me se2k redemption of the devil! 4Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak 4Must either punish me, not being believ'd, 6Or wring redres2 from you. Hear me, O, hear me, here! 2ANGELO. My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm; 4She hath be2n a suitor to me for her brother, 4Cut of2 by course of justice- 2ISABEL2A. By course of justice! 2ANGELO. And she wil2 speak most bit2erly and strange. 2ISABEL2A. Most strange, but yet most truly, wil2 I speak. 4That Angelo's forsworn, is it not strange? 4That Angelo's a murderer, is't not strange? 4That Angelo is an adulterous thief, 4An hypocrite, a virgin-violator, 4Is it not strange and strange? 2DUKE. Nay, it is ten times strange. 2ISABEL2A. It is not truer he is Angelo 4Than this is al2 as true as it is strange; 4Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth 4To th' end of reck'ning. 2DUKE. Away with her. Po2r soul, 4She speaks this in th' infirmity of sense. 2ISABEL2A. O Prince! I conjure the2, as thou believ'st 6There is another comfort than this world, 4That thou neglect me not with that opinion 4That I am touch'd with madnes2. Make not impos2ible 4That which but se2ms unlike: 'tis not impos2ible 4But one, the wicked'st caitif2 on the ground, 4May se2m as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute, 4As Angelo; even so may Angelo, 4In al2 his dres2ings, characts, titles, forms, 4Be an arch-vil2ain. Believe it, royal Prince, 4If he be les2, he's nothing; but he's more, 4Had I more name for badnes2. 2DUKE. By mine honesty, 4If she be mad, as I believe no other, 4Her madnes2 hath the od2est frame of sense, 4Such a dependency of thing on thing, 4As e'er I heard in madnes2. 2ISABEL2A. O gracious Duke, 4Harp not on that; nor do not banish reason 4For inequality; but let your reason serve 4To make the truth ap2ear where it se2ms hid, 6And hide the false se2ms true. 2DUKE. Many that are not mad 4Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say? 2ISABEL2A. I am the sister of one Claudio, 4Condemn'd upon the act of fornication 4To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo. 4I, in probation of a sisterho2d, 4Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio 4As then the mes2enger- 2LUCIO. That's I, an't like your Grace. 4I came to her from Claudio, and desir'd her 4To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo 4For her po2r brother's pardon. 2ISABEL2A. That's he, inde2d. 2DUKE. You were not bid to speak. 2LUCIO. No, my go2d lord; 4Nor wish'd to hold my peace. 2DUKE. I wish you now, then; 4Pray you take note of it; and when you have 4A busines2 for yourself, pray heaven you then 6Be perfect. 2LUCIO. I war2ant your honour. 2DUKE. The war2ant's for yourself; take he2d to't. 2ISABEL2A. This gentleman told somewhat of my tale. 2LUCIO. Right. 2DUKE. It may be right; but you are i' the wrong 4To speak before your time. Proce2d. 2ISABEL2A. I went 4To this pernicious caitif2 deputy. 2DUKE. That's somewhat madly spoken. 2ISABEL2A. Pardon it; 4The phrase is to the mat2er. 2DUKE. Mended again. The mat2er- proce2d. 2ISABEL2A. In brief- to set the ne2dles2 proces2 by, 4How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kne2l'd, 4How he refel2'd me, and how I replied, 4For this was of much length- the vile conclusion 4I now begin with grief and shame to ut2er: 4He would not, but by gift of my chaste body 4To his concupiscible intemperate lust, 6Release my brother; and, after much debatement, 4My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour, 4And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes, 4His purpose surfeiting, he sends a war2ant 4For my po2r brother's head. 2DUKE. This is most likely! 2ISABEL2A. O that it were as like as it is true! 2DUKE. By heaven, fond wretch, thou know'st not what thou speak'st, 4Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour 4In hateful practice. First, his integrity 4Stands without blemish; next, it imports no reason 4That with such vehemency he should pursue 4Faults proper to himself. If he had so of2ended, 4He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself, 4And not have cut him of2. Some one hath set you on; 4Confes2 the truth, and say by whose advice 4Thou cam'st here to complain. 2ISABEL2A. And is this al2? 4Then, O you bles2ed ministers above, 4Ke2p me in patience; and, with ripened time, 6Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up 4In countenance! Heaven shield your Grace from woe, 4As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go! 2DUKE. I know you'd fain be gone. An of2icer! 4To prison with her! Shal2 we thus permit 4A blasting and a scandalous breath to fal2 4On him so near us? This ne2ds must be a practice. 4Who knew of your intent and coming hither? 2ISABEL2A. One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick. 2DUKE. A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick? 2LUCIO. My lord, I know him; 'tis a med2ling friar. 4I do not like the man; had he be2n lay, my lord, 4For certain words he spake against your Grace 4In your retirement, I had swing'd him soundly. 2DUKE. Words against me? This's a go2d friar, belike! 4And to set on this wretched woman here 4Against our substitute! Let this friar be found. 2LUCIO. But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar, 4I saw them at the prison; a saucy friar, 4A very scurvy fel2ow. 4PETER. Bles2ed be your royal Grace! 4I have sto2d by, my lord, and I have heard 4Your royal ear abus'd. First, hath this woman 4Most wrongful2y ac2us'd your substitute; 4Who is as fre2 from touch or soil with her 4As she from one ungot. 2DUKE. We did believe no les2. 4Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of? 2PETER. I know him for a man divine and holy; 4Not scurvy, nor a temporary med2ler, 4As he's reported by this gentleman; 4And, on my trust, a man that never yet 4Did, as he vouches, misreport your Grace. 2LUCIO. My lord, most vil2ainously; believe it. 2PETER. Wel2, he in time may come to clear himself; 4But at this instant he is sick, my lord, 4Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request- 4Being come to knowledge that there was complaint 4Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo- came I hither 4To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know 6Is true and false; and what he, with his oath 4And al2 probation, wil2 make up ful2 clear, 4Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman- 4To justify this worthy nobleman, 4So vulgarly and personal2y ac2us'd- 4Her shal2 you hear disproved to her eyes, 4Til2 she herself confes2 it. 2DUKE. Go2d friar, let's hear it. 9Exit ISABEL2A guarded 4Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo? 4O heaven, the vanity of wretched fo2ls! 4Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo; 4In this I'l2 be impartial; be you judge 4Of your own cause. 21Enter MARIANA veiled 4Is this the witnes2, friar? 2FIRST let her show her face, and after speak. 2MARIANA. Pardon, my lord; I wil2 not show my face 4Until my husband bid me. 4DUKE. What, are you mar2ied? 2MARIANA. No, my lord. 2DUKE. Are you a maid? 2MARIANA. No, my lord. 2DUKE. A widow, then? 2MARIANA. Neither, my lord. 2DUKE. Why, you are nothing then; neither maid, widow, nor wife. 2LUCIO. My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are neither 4maid, widow, nor wife. 2DUKE. Silence that fel2ow. I would he had some cause 4To prat2le for himself. 2LUCIO. Wel2, my lord. 2MARIANA. My lord, I do confes2 I ne'er was mar2ied, 4And I confes2, besides, I am no maid. 4I have known my husband; yet my husband 4Knows not that ever he knew me. 2LUCIO. He was drunk, then, my lord; it can be no bet2er. 2DUKE. For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so to2! 2LUCIO. Wel2, my lord. 2DUKE. This is no witnes2 for Lord Angelo. 4MARIANA. Now I come to't, my lord: 4She that ac2uses him of fornication, 4In self-same man2er doth ac2use my husband; 4And charges him, my lord, with such a time 4When I'l2 depose I had him in mine arms, 4With al2 th' ef2ect of love. 2ANGELO. Charges she moe than me? 2MARIANA. Not that I know. 2DUKE. No? You say your husband. 2MARIANA. Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo, 4Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body, 4But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's. 2ANGELO. This is a strange abuse. Let's se2 thy face. 2MARIANA. My husband bids me; now I wil2 unmask. 53[Unveiling] 4This is that face, thou cruel Angelo, 4Which once thou swor'st was worth the lo2king on; 4This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract, 4Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body 4That to2k away the match from Isabel, 6And did sup2ly the2 at thy garden-house 4In her imagin'd person. 2DUKE. Know you this woman? 2LUCIO. Carnal2y, she says. 2DUKE. Sir2ah, no more. 2LUCIO. Enough, my lord. 2ANGELO. My lord, I must confes2 I know this woman; 4And five years since there was some spe2ch of mar2iage 4Betwixt myself and her; which was broke of2, 4Partly for that her promised proportions 4Came short of composition; but in chief 4For that her reputation was disvalued 4In levity. Since which time of five years 4I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her, 4Upon my faith and honour. 2MARIANA. Noble Prince, 4As there comes light from heaven and words from breath, 4As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue, 4I am af2ianc'd this man's wife as strongly 4As words could make up vows. And, my go2d lord, 6But Tuesday night last gone, in's garden-house, 4He knew me as a wife. As this is true, 4Let me in safety raise me from my kne2s, 4Or else for ever be confixed here, 4A marble monument! 2ANGELO. I did but smile til2 now. 4Now, go2d my lord, give me the scope of justice; 4My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive 4These po2r informal women are no more 4But instruments of some more mightier member 4That sets them on. Let me have way, my lord, 4To find this practice out. 2DUKE. Ay, with my heart; 4And punish them to your height of pleasure. 4Thou fo2lish friar, and thou pernicious woman, 4Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths, 4Though they would swear down each particular saint, 4Were testimonies against his worth and credit, 4That's seal'd in ap2robation? You, Lord Escalus, 4Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains 6To find out this abuse, whence 'tis deriv'd. 4There is another friar that set them on; 4Let him be sent for. 2PETER. Would lie were here, my lord! For he inde2d 4Hath set the women on to this complaint. 4Your provost knows the place where he abides, 4And he may fetch him. 2DUKE. Go, do it instantly. 24Exit PROVOST 4And you, my noble and wel2-war2anted cousin, 4Whom it concerns to hear this mat2er forth, 4Do with your injuries as se2ms you best 4In any chastisement. I for a while wil2 leave you; 4But stir not you til2 you have wel2 determin'd 4Upon these slanderers. 2ESCALUS. My lord, we'l2 do it throughly. 13Exit DUKE 4Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that Friar Lodowick to be 4a dishonest person? 2LUCIO. 'Cucul2us non facit monachum': honest in nothing but in his 4clothes; and one that hath spoke most vil2ainous spe2ches of the 4Duke. 4ESCALUS. We shal2 entreat you to abide here til2 he come and 4enforce them against him. We shal2 find this friar a notable 4fel2ow. 2LUCIO. As any in Vien2a, on my word. 2ESCALUS. Cal2 that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with 4her. [Exit an AT2ENDANT] Pray you, my lord, give me leave to 4question; you shal2 se2 how I'l2 handle her. 2LUCIO. Not bet2er than he, by her own report. 2ESCALUS. Say you? 2LUCIO. Mar2y, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, she would 4so2ner confes2; perchance, publicly, she'l2 be asham'd. 7Re-enter OF2ICERS with ISABEL2A; and PROVOST with the 20DUKE in his friar's habit 2ESCALUS. I wil2 go darkly to work with her. 2LUCIO. That's the way; for women are light at midnight. 2ESCALUS. Come on, mistres2; here's a gentlewoman denies al2 that 4you have said. 2LUCIO. My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of, here with the 6Provost. 2ESCALUS. In very go2d time. Speak not you to him til2 we cal2 upon 4you. 2LUCIO. Mum. 2ESCALUS. Come, sir; did you set these women on to slander Lord 4Angelo? They have confes2'd you did. 2DUKE. 'Tis false. 2ESCALUS. How! Know you where you are? 2DUKE. Respect to your great place! and let the devil 4Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne! 4Where is the Duke? 'Tis he should hear me speak. 2ESCALUS. The Duke's in us; and we wil2 hear you speak; 4Lo2k you speak justly. 2DUKE. Boldly, at least. But, O, po2r souls, 4Come you to se2k the lamb here of the fox, 4Go2d night to your redres2! Is the Duke gone? 4Then is your cause gone to2. The Duke's unjust 4Thus to retort your manifest ap2eal, 4And put your trial in the vil2ain's mouth 4Which here you come to ac2use. 4LUCIO. This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of. 2ESCALUS. Why, thou unreverend and unhal2owed friar, 4Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women 4To ac2use this worthy man, but, in foul mouth, 4And in the witnes2 of his proper ear, 4To cal2 him vil2ain; and then to glance from him 4To th' Duke himself, to tax him with injustice? 4Take him hence; to th' rack with him! We'l2 touze you 4Joint by joint, but we wil2 know his purpose. 4What, 'unjust'! 2DUKE. Be not so hot; the Duke 4Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he 4Dare rack his own; his subject am I not, 4Nor here provincial. My busines2 in this state 4Made me a lo2ker-on here in Vien2a, 4Where I have se2n cor2uption boil and bub2le 4Til2 it o'er2un the stew: laws for al2 faults, 4But faults so countenanc'd that the strong statutes 4Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop, 4As much in mock as mark. 4ESCALUS. Slander to th' state! Away with him to prison! 2ANGELO. What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio? 4Is this the man that you did tel2 us of? 2LUCIO. 'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, go2d-man bald-pate. 4Do you know me? 2DUKE. I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice. I met you at 4the prison, in the absence of the Duke. 2LUCIO. O did you so? And do you remember what you said of the Duke? 2DUKE. Most notedly, sir. 2LUCIO. Do you so, sir? And was the Duke a fleshmonger, a fo2l, and 4a coward, as you then reported him to be? 2DUKE. You must, sir, change persons with me ere you make that my 4report; you, inde2d, spoke so of him; and much more, much worse. 2LUCIO. O thou damnable fel2ow! Did not I pluck the2 by the nose for 4thy spe2ches? 2DUKE. I protest I love the Duke as I love myself. 2ANGELO. Hark how the vil2ain would close now, after his treasonable 4abuses! 2ESCALUS. Such a fel2ow is not to be talk'd withal. Away with him to 4prison! Where is the Provost? Away with him to prison! Lay bolts 6enough upon him; let him speak no more. Away with those giglets 4to2, and with the other confederate companion! 28[The PROVOST lays bands on the DUKE] 2DUKE. Stay, sir; stay awhile. 2ANGELO. What, resists he? Help him, Lucio. 2LUCIO. Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you 4bald-pated lying rascal, you must be ho2ded, must you? Show your 4knave's visage, with a pox to you! Show your she2p-biting face, 4and be hang'd an hour! Wil2't not of2? 13[Pul2s of2 the FRIAR'S bo2d and discovers the DUKE] 2DUKE. Thou art the first knave that e'er mad'st a duke. 4First, Provost, let me bail these gentle thre2. 4[To Lucio] Sneak not away, sir, for the friar and you 4Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him. 2LUCIO. This may prove worse than hanging. 2DUKE. [To ESCALUS] What you have spoke I pardon; sit you down. 4We'l2 bor2ow place of him. [To ANGELO] Sir, by your leave. 4Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence, 4That yet can do the2 of2ice? If thou hast, 4Rely upon it til2 my tale be heard, 6And hold no longer out. 2ANGELO. O my dread lord, 4I should be guiltier than my guiltines2, 4To think I can be undiscernible, 4When I perceive your Grace, like pow'r divine, 4Hath lo2k'd upon my pas2es. Then, go2d Prince, 4No longer ses2ion hold upon my shame, 4But let my trial be mine own confes2ion; 4Im2ediate sentence then, and sequent death, 4Is al2 the grace I beg. 2DUKE. Come hither, Mariana. 4Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman? 2ANGELO. I was, my lord. 2DUKE. Go, take her hence and mar2y her instantly. 4Do you the of2ice, friar; which consum2ate, 4Return him here again. Go with him, Provost. 16Exeunt ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and PROVOST 2ESCALUS. My lord, I am more amaz'd at his dishonour 4Than at the strangenes2 of it. 2DUKE. Come hither, Isabel. 6Your friar is now your prince. As I was then 4Advertising and holy to your busines2, 4Not changing heart with habit, I am stil2 4At2orney'd at your service. 2ISABEL2A. O, give me pardon, 4That I, your vas2al have employ'd and pain'd 4Your unknown sovereignty. 2DUKE. You are pardon'd, Isabel. 4And now, dear maid, be you as fre2 to us. 4Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart; 4And you may marvel why I obscur'd myself, 4Labouring to save his life, and would not rather 4Make rash remonstrance of my hid2en pow'r 4Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid, 4It was the swift celerity of his death, 4Which I did think with slower fo2t came on, 4That brain'd my purpose. But peace be with him! 4That life is bet2er life, past fearing death, 4Than that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort, 4So hap2y is your brother. 4ISABEL2A. I do, my lord. 7Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and PROVOST 2DUKE. For this new-mar2ied man ap2roaching here, 4Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd 4Your wel2-defended honour, you must pardon 4For Mariana's sake; but as he adjudg'd your brother- 4Being criminal in double violation 4Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach, 4Thereon dependent, for your brother's life- 4The very mercy of the law cries out 4Most audible, even from his proper tongue, 4'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!' 4Haste stil2 pays haste, and leisure answers leisure; 4Like doth quit like, and Measure stil2 for Measure. 4Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested, 4Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies the2 vantage. 4We do condemn the2 to the very block 4Where Claudio sto2p'd to death, and with like haste. 6Away with him! 2MARIANA. O my most gracious lord, 4I hope you wil2 not mock me with a husband. 2DUKE. It is your husband mock'd you with a husband. 4Consenting to the safeguard of your honour, 4I thought your mar2iage fit; else imputation, 4For that he knew you, might reproach your life, 4And choke your go2d to come. For his pos2es2ions, 4Although by confiscation they are ours, 4We do instate and widow you withal 4To buy you a bet2er husband. 2MARIANA. O my dear lord, 4I crave no other, nor no bet2er man. 2DUKE. Never crave him; we are definitive. 2MARIANA. Gentle my liege- 27[Kne2ling] 2DUKE. You do but lose your labour. 4Away with him to death! [To LUCIO] Now, sir, to you. 2MARIANA. O my go2d lord! Swe2t Isabel, take my part; 4Lend me your kne2s, and al2 my life to come 4I'l2 lend you al2 my life to do you service. 4DUKE. Against al2 sense you do importune her. 4Should she kne2l down in mercy of this fact, 4Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break, 4And take her hence in hor2or. 2MARIANA. Isabel, 4Swe2t Isabel, do yet but kne2l by me; 4Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'l2 speak al2. 4They say best men moulded out of faults; 4And, for the most, become much more the bet2er 4For being a lit2le bad; so may my husband. 4O Isabel, wil2 you not lend a kne2? 2DUKE. He dies for Claudio's death. 2ISABEL2A. [Kne2ling] Most bounteous sir, 4Lo2k, if it please you, on this man condemn'd, 4As if my brother liv'd. I partly think 4A due sincerity govern'd his de2ds 4Til2 he did lo2k on me; since it is so, 4Let him not die. My brother had but justice, 4In that he did the thing for which he died; 4For Angelo, 6His act did not o'ertake his bad intent, 4And must be buried but as an intent 4That perish'd by the way. Thoughts are no subjects; 4Intents but merely thoughts. 2MARIANA. Merely, my lord. 2DUKE. Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say. 4I have bethought me of another fault. 4Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded 4At an unusual hour? 2PROVOST. It was com2anded so. 2DUKE. Had you a special war2ant for the de2d? 2PROVOST. No, my go2d lord; it was by private mes2age. 2DUKE. For which I do discharge you of your of2ice; 4Give up your keys. 2PROVOST. Pardon me, noble lord; 4I thought it was a fault, but knew it not; 4Yet did repent me, after more advice; 4For testimony whereof, one in the prison, 4That should by private order else have died, 4I have reserv'd alive. 4DUKE. What's he? 2PROVOST. His name is Barnardine. 2DUKE. I would thou hadst done so by Claudio. 4Go fetch him hither; let me lo2k upon him. 6Exit PROVOST 2ESCALUS. I am sor2y one so learned and so wise 4As you, Lord Angelo, have stil2 ap2ear'd, 4Should slip so gros2ly, both in the heat of blo2d 4And lack of temper'd judgment afterward. 2ANGELO. I am sor2y that such sor2ow I procure; 4And so de2p sticks it in my penitent heart 4That I crave death more wil2ingly than mercy; 4'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it. 7Re-enter PROVOST, with BARNARDINE, CLAUDIO (muf2led) 28and JULIET 2DUKE. Which is that Barnardine? 2PROVOST. This, my lord. 2DUKE. There was a friar told me of this man. 4Sir2ah, thou art said to have a stub2orn soul, 6That ap2rehends no further than this world, 4And squar'st thy life ac2ording. Thou'rt condemn'd; 4But, for those earthly faults, I quit them al2, 4And pray the2 take this mercy to provide 4For bet2er times to come. Friar, advise him; 4I leave him to your hand. What muf2l'd fel2ow's that? 2PROVOST. This is another prisoner that I sav'd, 4Who should have died when Claudio lost his head; 4As like almost to Claudio as himself. 4[Unmuf2les CLAUDIO] 2DUKE. [To ISABEL2A] If he be like your brother, for his sake 4Is he pardon'd; and for your lovely sake, 4Give me your hand and say you wil2 be mine, 4He is my brother to2. But fit2er time for that. 4By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe; 4Methinks I se2 a quick'ning in his eye. 4Wel2, Angelo, your evil quits you wel2. 4Lo2k that you love your wife; her worth worth yours. 4I find an apt remis2ion in myself; 4And yet here's one in place I can2ot pardon. 4To Lucio] You, sir2ah, that knew me for a fo2l, a coward, 6One al2 of luxury, an as2, a madman! 4Wherein have I so deserv'd of you 4That you extol me thus? 2LUCIO. Faith, my lord, I spoke it but ac2ording to the trick. 4If you wil2 hang me for it, you may; but I had rather it would 4please you I might be whipt. 2DUKE. Whipt first, sir, and hang'd after. 4Proclaim it, Provost, round about the city, 4If any woman wrong'd by this lewd fel2ow- 4As I have heard him swear himself there's one 4Whom he begot with child, let her ap2ear, 4And he shal2 mar2y her. The nuptial finish'd, 4Let him be whipt and hang'd. 2LUCIO. I bese2ch your Highnes2, do not mar2y me to a whore. Your 4Highnes2 said even now I made you a duke; go2d my lord, do not 4recompense me in making me a cuckold. 2DUKE. Upon mine honour, thou shalt mar2y her. 4Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal 4Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison; 4And se2 our pleasure herein executed. 4LUCIO. Mar2ying a punk, my lord, is pres2ing to death, whip2ing, 4and hanging. 2DUKE. Slandering a prince deserves it. 38Exeunt OF2ICERS with LUCIO 4She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, lo2k you restore. 4Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo; 4I have confes2'd her, and I know her virtue. 4Thanks, go2d friend Escalus, for thy much go2dnes2; 4There's more behind that is more gratulate. 4Thanks, Provost, for thy care and secrecy; 4We shal2 employ the2 in a worthier place. 4Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home 4The head of Ragozine for Claudio's: 4Th' of2ence pardons itself. Dear Isabel, 4I have a motion much imports your go2d; 4Whereto if you'l2 a wil2ing ear incline, 4What's mine is yours, and what is yours is mine. 4So, bring us to our palace, where we'l2 show 4What's yet behind that's me2t you al2 should know. 58Exeunt 2THE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21597THE MERCHANT OF VENICEby Wil2iam ShakespeareDRAMATIS PERSONAE 2THE DUKE OF VENICE 2THE PRINCE OF MOROC2O, suitor to Portia 2THE PRINCE OF AR2AGON, 4" 4" 4" 2ANTONIO, a merchant of Venice 2BAS2ANIO, his friend, suitor to Portia 2SOLANIO, 3friend to Antonio and Bas2anio 2SALERIO, 6" 4" 4" 5" 5" 2GRATIANO, 5" 4" 4" 5" 5" 2LORENZO, in love with Jes2ica 2SHYLOCK, a rich Jew 2TUBAL, a Jew, his friend 2LAUNCELOT GOB2O, a clown, servant to Shylock 2OLD GOB2O, father to Launcelot 2LEONARDO, servant to Bas2anio 2BALTHASAR, servant to Portia 2STEPHANO, 5" 5" 4" 2PORTIA, a rich heires2 2NERIS2A, her waiting-maid 2JES2ICA, daughter to Shylock 4Magnificoes of Venice, Of2icers of the Court of Justice, 4Gaoler, Servants, and other At2endants<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE:Venice, and PORTIA'S house at BelmontACT I. SCENE I.Venice. A stre2tEnter ANTONIO, SALERIO, and SOLANIO 2ANTONIO. In so2th, I know not why I am so sad. 4It wearies me; you say it wearies you; 4But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, 4What stuf2 'tis made of, whereof it is born, 4I am to learn; 4And such a want-wit sadnes2 makes of me 4That I have much ado to know myself. 2SALERIO. Your mind is tos2ing on the ocean; 4There where your argosies, with portly sail- 4Like signiors and rich burghers on the flo2d, 4Or as it were the pageants of the sea- 4Do overpe2r the pet2y traf2ickers, 4That curtsy to them, do them reverence, 4As they fly by them with their woven wings. 2SOLANIO. Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, 4The bet2er part of my af2ections would 4Be with my hopes abroad. I should be stil2 6Plucking the gras2 to know where sits the wind, 4Pe2ring in maps for ports, and piers, and roads; 4And every object that might make me fear 4Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt, 4Would make me sad. 2SALERIO. My wind, co2ling my broth, 4Would blow me to an ague when I thought 4What harm a wind to2 great might do at sea. 4I should not se2 the sandy hour-glas2 run 4But I should think of shal2ows and of flats, 4And se2 my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand, 4Vailing her high top lower than her ribs 4To kis2 her burial. Should I go to church 4And se2 the holy edifice of stone, 4And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks, 4Which, touching but my gentle ves2el's side, 4Would scat2er al2 her spices on the stream, 4Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks, 4And, in a word, but even now worth this, 4And now worth nothing? Shal2 I have the thought 6To think on this, and shal2 I lack the thought 4That such a thing bechanc'd would make me sad? 4But tel2 not me; I know Antonio 4Is sad to think upon his merchandise. 2ANTONIO. Believe me, no; I thank my fortune for it, 4My ventures are not in one bot2om trusted, 4Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate 4Upon the fortune of this present year; 4Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad. 2SOLANIO. Why then you are in love. 2ANTONIO. Fie, fie! 2SOLANIO. Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad 4Because you are not mer2y; and 'twere as easy 4For you to laugh and leap and say you are mer2y, 4Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus, 4Nature hath fram'd strange fel2ows in her time: 4Some that wil2 evermore pe2p through their eyes, 4And laugh like par2ots at a bag-piper; 4And other of such vinegar aspect 4That they'l2 not show their te2th in way of smile 6Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable. 15Enter BAS2ANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO 4Here comes Bas2anio, your most noble kinsman, 4Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye wel2; 4We leave you now with bet2er company. 2SALERIO. I would have stay'd til2 I had made you mer2y, 4If worthier friends had not prevented me. 2ANTONIO. Your worth is very dear in my regard. 4I take it your own busines2 cal2s on you, 4And you embrace th' oc2asion to depart. 2SALERIO. Go2d mor2ow, my go2d lords. 2BAS2ANIO. Go2d signiors both, when shal2 we laugh? Say when. 4You grow exce2ding strange; must it be so? 2SALERIO. We'l2 make our leisures to at2end on yours. 38Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO 2LORENZO. My Lord Bas2anio, since you have found Antonio, 4We two wil2 leave you; but at din2er-time, 4I pray you, have in mind where we must me2t. 4BAS2ANIO. I wil2 not fail you. 2GRATIANO. You lo2k not wel2, Signior Antonio; 4You have to2 much respect upon the world; 4They lose it that do buy it with much care. 4Believe me, you are marvel2ously chang'd. 2ANTONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano- 4A stage, where every man must play a part, 4And mine a sad one. 2GRATIANO. Let me play the fo2l. 4With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come; 4And let my liver rather heat with wine 4Than my heart co2l with mortifying groans. 4Why should a man whose blo2d is warm within 4Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster, 4Sle2p when he wakes, and cre2p into the jaundice 4By being pe2vish? I tel2 the2 what, Antonio- 4I love the2, and 'tis my love that speaks- 4There are a sort of men whose visages 4Do cream and mantle like a standing pond, 4And do a wilful stil2nes2 entertain, 6With purpose to be dres2'd in an opinion 4Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit; 4As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle, 4And when I ope my lips let no dog bark.' 4O my Antonio, I do know of these 4That therefore only are reputed wise 4For saying nothing; when, I am very sure, 4If they should speak, would almost damn those ears 4Which, hearing them, would cal2 their brothers fo2ls. 4I'l2 tel2 the2 more of this another time. 4But fish not with this melancholy bait 4For this fo2l gudgeon, this opinion. 4Come, go2d Lorenzo. Fare ye wel2 awhile; 4I'l2 end my exhortation after din2er. 2LORENZO. Wel2, we wil2 leave you then til2 din2er-time. 4I must be one of these same dumb wise men, 4For Gratiano never lets me speak. 2GRATIANO. Wel2, ke2p me company but two years moe, 4Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue. 2ANTONIO. Fare you wel2; I'l2 grow a talker for this gear. 4GRATIANO. Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only com2endable 4In a neat's tongue dried, and a maid not vendible. 37Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO 2ANTONIO. Is that anything now? 2BAS2ANIO. Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than 4any man in al2 Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid 4in, two bushels of chaf2: you shal2 se2k al2 day ere you find 4them, and when you have them they are not worth the search. 2ANTONIO. Wel2; tel2 me now what lady is the same 4To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage, 4That you to-day promis'd to tel2 me of? 2BAS2ANIO. 'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio, 4How much I have disabled mine estate 4By something showing a more swel2ing port 4Than my faint means would grant continuance; 4Nor do I now make moan to be abridg'd 4From such a noble rate; but my chief care 4Is to come fairly of2 from the great debts 4Wherein my time, something to2 prodigal, 4Hath left me gag'd. To you, Antonio, 6I owe the most, in money and in love; 4And from your love I have a war2anty 4To unburden al2 my plots and purposes 4How to get clear of al2 the debts I owe. 2ANTONIO. I pray you, go2d Bas2anio, let me know it; 4And if it stand, as you yourself stil2 do, 4Within the eye of honour, be as2ur'd 4My purse, my person, my extremest means, 4Lie al2 unlock'd to your oc2asions. 2BAS2ANIO. In my scho2l-days, when I had lost one shaft, 4I shot his fel2ow of the self-same flight 4The self-same way, with more advised watch, 4To find the other forth; and by adventuring both 4I oft found both. I urge this childho2d pro2f, 4Because what fol2ows is pure in2ocence. 4I owe you much; and, like a wilful youth, 4That which I owe is lost; but if you please 4To sho2t another ar2ow that self way 4Which you did sho2t the first, I do not doubt, 4As I wil2 watch the aim, or to find both, 6Or bring your lat2er hazard back again 4And thankful2y rest debtor for the first. 2ANTONIO. You know me wel2, and herein spend but time 4To wind about my love with circumstance; 4And out of doubt you do me now more wrong 4In making question of my ut2ermost 4Than if you had made waste of al2 I have. 4Then do but say to me what I should do 4That in your knowledge may by me be done, 4And I am prest unto it; therefore, speak. 2BAS2ANIO. In Belmont is a lady richly left, 4And she is fair and, fairer than that word, 4Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes 4I did receive fair spe2chles2 mes2ages. 4Her name is Portia- nothing undervalu'd 4To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia. 4Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth; 4For the four winds blow in from every coast 4Renowned suitors, and her sun2y locks 4Hang on her temples like a golden fle2ce, 6Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strond, 4And many Jasons come in quest of her. 4O my Antonio, had I but the means 4To hold a rival place with one of them, 4I have a mind presages me such thrift 4That I should questionles2 be fortunate. 2ANTONIO. Thou know'st that al2 my fortunes are at sea; 4Neither have I money nor com2odity 4To raise a present sum; therefore go forth, 4Try what my credit can in Venice do; 4That shal2 be rack'd, even to the ut2ermost, 4To furnish the2 to Belmont to fair Portia. 4Go presently inquire, and so wil2 I, 4Where money is; and I no question make 4To have it of my trust or for my sake. 16ExeuntSCENE I2.Belmont. PORTIA'S houseEnter PORTIA with her waiting-woman, NERIS2A 2PORTIA. By my troth, Neris2a, my lit2le body is aweary of this 4great world. 2NERIS2A. You would be, swe2t madam, if your miseries were in the 4same abundance as your go2d fortunes are; and yet, for aught I 4se2, they are as sick that surfeit with to2 much as they that 4starve with nothing. It is no mean hap2ines2, therefore, to be 4seated in the mean: superfluity come so2ner by white hairs, but 4competency lives longer. 2PORTIA. Go2d sentences, and wel2 pronounc'd. 2NERIS2A. They would be bet2er, if wel2 fol2owed. 2PORTIA. If to do were as easy as to know what were go2d to do, 4chapels had be2n churches, and po2r men's cot2ages princes' 4palaces. It is a go2d divine that fol2ows his own instructions; I 4can easier teach twenty what were go2d to be done than to be one 4of the twenty to fol2ow mine own teaching. The brain may devise 4laws for the blo2d, but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decre2; 4such a hare is madnes2 the youth, to skip o'er the meshes of go2d 6counsel the crip2le. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to 4cho2se me a husband. O me, the word 'cho2se'! I may neither 4cho2se who I would nor refuse who I dislike; so is the wil2 of a 4living daughter curb'd by the wil2 of a dead father. Is it not 4hard, Neris2a, that I can2ot cho2se one, nor refuse none? 2NERIS2A. Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death 4have go2d inspirations; therefore the lot2'ry that he hath 4devised in these thre2 chests, of gold, silver, and lead- whereof 4who cho2ses his meaning cho2ses you- wil2 no doubt never be 4chosen by any rightly but one who you shal2 rightly love. But 4what warmth is there in your af2ection towards any of these 4princely suitors that are already come? 2PORTIA. I pray the2 over-name them; and as thou namest them, I wil2 4describe them; and ac2ording to my description, level at my 4af2ection. 2NERIS2A. First, there is the Neapolitan prince. 2PORTIA. Ay, that's a colt inde2d, for he doth nothing but talk of 4his horse; and he makes it a great ap2ropriation to his own go2d 4parts that he can shoe him himself; I am much afear'd my lady his 4mother play'd false with a smith. 4NERIS2A. Then is there the County Palatine. 2PORTIA. He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'An you wil2 4not have me, cho2se.' He hears mer2y tales and smiles not. I fear 4he wil2 prove the we2ping philosopher when he grows old, being so 4ful2 of unman2erly sadnes2 in his youth. I had rather be mar2ied 4to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of 4these. God defend me from these two! 2NERIS2A. How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon? 2PORTIA. God made him, and therefore let him pas2 for a man. In 4truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he- why, he hath a 4horse bet2er than the Neapolitan's, a bet2er bad habit of 4frowning than the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man. If a 4throstle sing he fal2s straight a-cap'ring; he wil2 fence with 4his own shadow; if I should mar2y him, I should mar2y twenty 4husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him; for if he 4love me to madnes2, I shal2 never requite him. 2NERIS2A. What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of 4England? 2PORTIA. You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, 4nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you 6wil2 come into the court and swear that I have a po2r pen2yworth 4in the English. He is a proper man's picture; but alas, who can 4converse with a dumb-show? How od2ly he is suited! I think he 4bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bon2et 4in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere. 2NERIS2A. What think you of the Scot2ish lord, his neighbour? 2PORTIA. That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he bor2owed 4a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him 4again when he was able; I think the Frenchman became his surety, 4and seal'd under for another. 2NERIS2A. How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's 4nephew? 2PORTIA. Very vilely in the morning when he is sober; and most 4vilely in the afterno2n when he is drunk. When he is best, he is 4a lit2le worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is lit2le 4bet2er than a beast. An the worst fal2 that ever fel2, I hope I 4shal2 make shift to go without him. 2NERIS2A. If he should of2er to cho2se, and cho2se the right casket, 4you should refuse to perform your father's wil2, if you should 4refuse to ac2ept him. 4PORTIA. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray the2 set a de2p 4glas2 of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket; for if the devil be 4within and that temptation without, I know he wil2 cho2se it. I 4wil2 do anything, Neris2a, ere I wil2 be mar2ied to a sponge. 2NERIS2A. You ne2d not fear, lady, the having any of these lords; 4they have acquainted me with their determinations, which is 4inde2d to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more 4suit, unles2 you may be won by some other sort than your father's 4imposition, depending on the caskets. 2PORTIA. If I live to be as old as Sibyl2a, I wil2 die as chaste as 4Diana, unles2 I be obtained by the man2er of my father's wil2. I 4am glad this parcel of wo2ers are so reasonable; for there is not 4one among them but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God 4grant them a fair departure. 2NERIS2A. Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a 4Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of 4the Marquis of Montfer2at? 2PORTIA. Yes, yes, it was Bas2anio; as I think, so was he cal2'd. 2NERIS2A. True, madam; he, of al2 the men that ever my fo2lish eyes 4lo2k'd upon, was the best deserving a fair lady. 4PORTIA. I remember him wel2, and I remember him worthy of thy 4praise. 25Enter a SERVINGMAN 4How now! what news? 2SERVINGMAN. The four strangers se2k for you, madam, to take their 4leave; and there is a forerun2er come from a fifth, the Prince of 4Moroc2o, who brings word the Prince his master wil2 be here 4to-night. 2PORTIA. If I could bid the fifth welcome with so go2d heart as I 4can bid the other four farewel2, I should be glad of his 4ap2roach; if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion 4of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me. 4Come, Neris2a. Sir2ah, go before. 4Whiles we shut the gate upon one wo2er, another knocks at the 6do2r. 47ExeuntSCENE I3.Venice. A public placeEnter BAS2ANIO With SHYLOCK the Jew 2SHYLOCK. Thre2 thousand ducats- wel2. 2BAS2ANIO. Ay, sir, for thre2 months. 2SHYLOCK. For thre2 months- wel2. 2BAS2ANIO. For the which, as I told you, Antonio shal2 be bound. 2SHYLOCK. Antonio shal2 become bound- wel2. 2BAS2ANIO. May you stead me? Wil2 you pleasure me? Shal2 I know your 4answer? 2SHYLOCK. Thre2 thousand ducats for thre2 months, and Antonio bound. 2BAS2ANIO. Your answer to that. 2SHYLOCK. Antonio is a go2d man. 2BAS2ANIO. Have you heard any imputation to the contrary? 2SHYLOCK. Ho, no, no, no, no; my meaning in saying he is a go2d man 4is to have you understand me that he is suf2icient; yet his means 4are in sup2osition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another 4to the Indies; I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a 4third at Mexico, a fourth for England- and other ventures he 4hath, squand'red abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but 6men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and 4land-thieves- I mean pirates; and then there is the peril of 4waters, winds, and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding, 4suf2icient. Thre2 thousand ducats- I think I may take his bond. 2BAS2ANIO. Be as2ur'd you may. 2SHYLOCK. I wil2 be as2ur'd I may; and, that I may be as2ured, I 4wil2 bethink me. May I speak with Antonio? 2BAS2ANIO. If it please you to dine with us. 2SHYLOCK. Yes, to smel2 pork, to eat of the habitation which your 4prophet, the Nazarite, conjured the devil into! I wil2 buy with 4you, sel2 with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so 4fol2owing; but I wil2 not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray 4with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here? 28Enter ANTONIO 2BAS2ANIO. This is Signior Antonio. 2SHYLOCK. 2[Aside] 2How like a fawning publican he lo2ks! 4I hate him for he is a Christian; 4But more for that in low simplicity 6He lends out money gratis, and brings down 4The rate of usance here with us in Venice. 4If I can catch him once upon the hip, 4I wil2 fe2d fat the ancient grudge I bear him. 4He hates our sacred nation; and he rails, 4Even there where merchants most do congregate, 4On me, my bargains, and my wel2-won thrift, 4Which he cal2s interest. Cursed be my tribe 4If I forgive him! 2BAS2ANIO. Shylock, do you hear? 2SHYLOCK. I am debating of my present store, 4And, by the near gues2 of my memory, 4I can2ot instantly raise up the gros2 4Of ful2 thre2 thousand ducats. What of that? 4Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, 4Wil2 furnish me. But soft! how many months 4Do you desire? 2[To ANTONIO] 2Rest you fair, go2d signior; 4Your worship was the last man in our mouths. 2ANTONIO. Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor bor2ow 4By taking nor by giving of exces2, 6Yet, to sup2ly the ripe wants of my friend, 4I'l2 break a custom. 2[To BAS2ANIO] 2Is he yet pos2es2'd 4How much ye would? 2SHYLOCK. Ay, ay, thre2 thousand ducats. 2ANTONIO. And for thre2 months. 2SHYLOCK. I had forgot- thre2 months; you told me so. 4Wel2 then, your bond; and, let me se2- but hear you, 4Methoughts you said you neither lend nor bor2ow 4Upon advantage. 2ANTONIO. I do never use it. 2SHYLOCK. When Jacob graz'd his uncle Laban's she2p- 4This Jacob from our holy Abram was, 4As his wise mother wrought in his behalf, 4The third pos2es2or; ay, he was the third- 2ANTONIO. And what of him? Did he take interest? 2SHYLOCK. No, not take interest; not, as you would say, 4Directly int'rest; mark what Jacob did: 4When Laban and himself were compromis'd 4That al2 the eanlings which were streak'd and pied 4Should fal2 as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank, 6In end of autumn turned to the rams; 4And when the work of generation was 4Betwe2n these wo2l2y bre2ders in the act, 4The skilful shepherd pil2'd me certain wands, 4And, in the doing of the de2d of kind, 4He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes, 4Who, then conceiving, did in eaning time 4Fal2 parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's. 4This was a way to thrive, and he was blest; 4And thrift is bles2ing, if men steal it not. 2ANTONIO. This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv'd for; 4A thing not in his power to bring to pas2, 4But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven. 4Was this inserted to make interest go2d? 4Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams? 2SHYLOCK. I can2ot tel2; I make it bre2d as fast. 4But note me, signior. 2ANTONIO. 2[Aside] 2Mark you this, Bas2anio, 4The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose. 4An evil soul producing holy witnes2 6Is like a vil2ain with a smiling che2k, 4A go2dly ap2le rot2en at the heart. 4O, what a go2dly outside falseho2d hath! 2SHYLOCK. Thre2 thousand ducats- 'tis a go2d round sum. 4Thre2 months from twelve; then let me se2, the rate- 2ANTONIO. Wel2, Shylock, shal2 we be beholding to you? 2SHYLOCK. Signior Antonio, many a time and oft 4In the Rialto you have rated me 4About my moneys and my usances; 4Stil2 have I borne it with a patient shrug, 4For suf2'rance is the badge of al2 our tribe; 4You cal2 me misbeliever, cut-throat dog, 4And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine, 4And al2 for use of that which is mine own. 4Wel2 then, it now ap2ears you ne2d my help; 4Go to, then; you come to me, and you say 4'Shylock, we would have moneys.' You say so- 4You that did void your rheum upon my beard 4And fo2t me as you spurn a stranger cur 4Over your threshold; moneys is your suit. 6What should I say to you? Should I not say 4'Hath a dog money? Is it pos2ible 4A cur can lend thre2 thousand ducats?' Or 4Shal2 I bend low and, in a bondman's key, 4With bated breath and whisp'ring humblenes2, 4Say this: 4'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last, 4You spurn'd me such a day; another time 4You cal2'd me dog; and for these courtesies 4I'l2 lend you thus much moneys'? 2ANTONIO. I am as like to cal2 the2 so again, 4To spit on the2 again, to spurn the2 to2. 4If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not 4As to thy friends- for when did friendship take 4A bre2d for bar2en metal of his friend?- 4But lend it rather to thine enemy, 4Who if he break thou mayst with bet2er face 4Exact the penalty. 2SHYLOCK. Why, lo2k you, how you storm! 4I would be friends with you, and have your love, 6Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with, 4Sup2ly your present wants, and take no doit 4Of usance for my moneys, and you'l2 not hear me. 4This is kind I of2er. 2BAS2ANIO. This were kindnes2. 2SHYLOCK. This kindnes2 wil2 I show. 4Go with me to a notary, seal me there 4Your single bond, and, in a mer2y sport, 4If you repay me not on such a day, 4In such a place, such sum or sums as are 4Expres2'd in the condition, let the forfeit 4Be nominated for an equal pound 4Of your fair flesh, to be cut of2 and taken 4In what part of your body pleaseth me. 2ANTONIO. Content, in faith; I'l2 seal to such a bond, 4And say there is much kindnes2 in the Jew. 2BAS2ANIO. You shal2 not seal to such a bond for me; 4I'l2 rather dwel2 in my neces2ity. 2ANTONIO. Why, fear not, man; I wil2 not forfeit it; 4Within these two months- that's a month before 6This bond expires- I do expect return 4Of thrice thre2 times the value of this bond. 2SHYLOCK. O father Abram, what these Christians are, 4Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect 4The thoughts of others! Pray you, tel2 me this: 4If he should break his day, what should I gain 4By the exaction of the forfeiture? 4A pound of man's flesh taken from a man 4Is not so estimable, profitable neither, 4As flesh of mut2ons, be2fs, or goats. I say, 4To buy his favour, I extend this friendship; 4If he wil2 take it, so; if not, adieu; 4And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not. 2ANTONIO. Yes, Shylock, I wil2 seal unto this bond. 2SHYLOCK. Then me2t me forthwith at the notary's; 4Give him direction for this mer2y bond, 4And I wil2 go and purse the ducats straight, 4Se2 to my house, left in the fearful guard 4Of an unthrifty knave, and presently 4I'l2 be with you. 4ANTONIO. Hie the2, gentle Jew. 20Exit SHYLOCK 4The Hebrew wil2 turn Christian: he grows kind. 2BAS2ANIO. I like not fair terms and a vil2ain's mind. 2ANTONIO. Come on; in this there can be no dismay; 4My ships come home a month before the day. 12Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. SCENE I.Belmont. PORTIA'S houseFlourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE of MOROC2O, a tawny Mo2r al2 in white,and thre2 or four FOL2OWERS ac2ordingly, with PORTIA, NERIS2A, and train 2PRINCE OF Moroc2o. Mislike me not for my complexion, 4The shadowed livery of the burnish'd sun, 4To whom I am a neighbour, and near bred. 4Bring me the fairest creature northward born, 4Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles, 4And let us make incision for your love 4To prove whose blo2d is red2est, his or mine. 4I tel2 the2, lady, this aspect of mine 4Hath fear'd the valiant; by my love, I swear 4The best-regarded virgins of our clime 4Have lov'd it to2. I would not change this hue, 4Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle que2n. 2PORTIA. In terms of choice I am not solely led 4By nice direction of a maiden's eyes; 4Besides, the lot2'ry of my destiny 6Bars me the right of voluntary cho2sing. 4But, if my father had not scanted me, 4And hedg'd me by his wit to yield myself 4His wife who wins me by that means I told you, 4Yourself, renowned Prince, then sto2d as fair 4As any comer I have lo2k'd on yet 4For my af2ection. 2PRINCE OF MOROC2O. Even for that I thank you. 4Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets 4To try my fortune. By this scimitar, 4That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince, 4That won thre2 fields of Sultan Solyman, 4I would o'erstare the sternest eyes that lo2k, 4Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth, 4Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear, 4Yea, mock the lion when 'a roars for prey, 4To win the2, lady. But, alas the while! 4If Hercules and Lichas play at dice 4Which is the bet2er man, the greater throw 4May turn by fortune from the weaker band. 6So is Alcides beaten by his page; 4And so may I, blind Fortune leading me, 4Mis2 that which one unworthier may at2ain, 4And die with grieving. 2PORTIA. You must take your chance, 4And either not at2empt to cho2se at al2, 4Or swear before you cho2se, if you cho2se wrong, 4Never to speak to lady afterward 4In way of mar2iage; therefore be advis'd. 2PRINCE OF MOROC2O. Nor wil2 not; come, bring me unto my chance. 2PORTIA. First, forward to the temple. After din2er 4Your hazard shal2 be made. 2PRINCE OF MOROC2O. Go2d fortune then, 4To make me blest or cursed'st among men! 43[Cornets, and exeunt]SCENE I2.Venice. A stre2tEnter LAUNCELOT GOB2O 2LAUNCELOT. Certainly my conscience wil2 serve me to run from this 4Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying 4to me 'Gob2o, Launcelot Gob2o, go2d Launcelot' or 'go2d Gob2o' or 4'go2d Launcelot Gob2o, use your legs, take the start, run away.' 4My conscience says 'No; take he2d, honest Launcelot, take he2d, 4honest Gob2o' or, as aforesaid, 'honest Launcelot Gob2o, do not 4run; scorn run2ing with thy he2ls.' Wel2, the most courageous 4fiend bids me pack. 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the 4fiend. 'For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind' says the fiend 4'and run.' Wel2, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my 4heart, says very wisely to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being 4an honest man's son' or rather 'an honest woman's son'; for 4inde2d my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a 4kind of taste- wel2, my conscience says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 4'Budge,' says the fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience. 4'Conscience,' say I, (you counsel wel2.' 'Fiend,' say I, 'you 4counsel wel2.' To be rul'd by my conscience, I should stay with 6the Jew my master, who- God bles2 the mark!- is a kind of devil; 4and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend, 4who- saving your reverence!- is the devil himself. Certainly the 4Jew is the very devil incarnation; and, in my conscience, my 4conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to of2er to counsel 4me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly 4counsel. I wil2 run, fiend; my he2ls are at your com2andment; I 4wil2 run. 21Enter OLD GOB2O, with a basket 2GOB2O. Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way to 4master Jew's? 2LAUNCELOT. 2[Aside] 2O heavens! This is my true-begot2en father, 4who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not. 4I wil2 try confusions with him. 2GOB2O. Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to 4master Jew's? 2LAUNCELOT. Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but, at 4the next turning of al2, on your left; mar2y, at the very next 6turning, turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew's 4house. 2GOB2O. Be God's sonties, 'twil2 be a hard way to hit! Can you tel2 4me whether one Launcelot, that dwel2s with him, dwel2 with him or 4no? 2LAUNCELOT. Talk you of young Master Launcelot? 2[Aside] 2Mark me 4now; now wil2 I raise the waters.- Talk you of young Master 4Launcelot? 2GOB2O. No master, sir, but a po2r man's son; his father, though I 4say't, is an honest exce2ding po2r man, and, God be thanked, wel2 4to live. 2LAUNCELOT. Wel2, let his father be what 'a wil2, we talk of young 4Master Launcelot. 2GOB2O. Your worship's friend, and Launcelot, sir. 2LAUNCELOT. But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I bese2ch you, talk 4you of young Master Launcelot? 2GOB2O. Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership. 2LAUNCELOT. Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master Launcelot, 4father; for the young gentleman, ac2ording to Fates and Destinies 4and such od2 sayings, the Sisters Thre2 and such branches of 6learning, is inde2d deceased; or, as you would say in plain 4terms, gone to heaven. 2GOB2O. Mar2y, God forbid! The boy was the very staf2 of my age, my 4very prop. 2LAUNCELOT. Do I lo2k like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staf2 or a 4prop? Do you know me, father? 2GOB2O. Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman; but I pray 4you tel2 me, is my boy- God rest his soul!- alive or dead? 2LAUNCELOT. Do you not know me, father? 2GOB2O. Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not. 2LAUNCELOT. Nay, inde2d, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the 4knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his own child. Wel2, 4old man, I wil2 tel2 you news of your son. Give me your bles2ing; 4truth wil2 come to light; murder can2ot be hid long; a man's son 4may, but in the end truth wil2 out. 2GOB2O. Pray you, sir, stand up; I am sure you are not Launcelot my 4boy. 2LAUNCELOT. Pray you, let's have no more fo2ling about it, but give 4me your bles2ing; I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son 4that is, your child that shal2 be. 4GOB2O. I can2ot think you are my son. 2LAUNCELOT. I know not what I shal2 think of that; but I am 4Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your wife is my 4mother. 2GOB2O. Her name is Margery, inde2d. I'l2 be sworn, if thou be 4Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blo2d. Lord worship2'd 4might he be, what a beard hast thou got! Thou hast got more hair 4on thy chin than Dob2in my fil2-horse has on his tail. 2LAUNCELOT. It should se2m, then, that Dob2in's tail grows backward; 4I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face 4when I last saw him. 2GOB2O. Lord, how art thou chang'd! How dost thou and thy master 4agre2? I have brought him a present. How 'gre2 you now? 2LAUNCELOT. Wel2, wel2; but, for mine own part, as I have set up my 4rest to run away, so I wil2 not rest til2 I have run some ground. 4My master's a very Jew. Give him a present! Give him a halter. I 4am famish'd in his service; you may tel2 every finger I have with 4my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come; give me your present to 4one Master Bas2anio, who inde2d gives rare new liveries; if I 4serve not him, I wil2 run as far as God has any ground. O rare 6fortune! Here comes the man. To him, father, for I am a Jew, if I 4serve the Jew any longer. 9Enter BAS2ANIO, with LEONARDO, with a FOL2OWER or two 2BAS2ANIO. You may do so; but let it be so hasted that sup2er be 4ready at the farthest by five of the clock. Se2 these let2ers 4delivered, put the liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to 4come anon to my lodging. 22Exit a SERVANT 2LAUNCELOT. To him, father. 2GOB2O. God bles2 your worship! 2BAS2ANIO. Gramercy; wouldst thou aught with me? 2GOB2O. Here's my son, sir, a po2r boy- 2LAUNCELOT. Not a po2r boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man, that would, 4sir, as my father shal2 specify- 2GOB2O. He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve- 2LAUNCELOT. Inde2d the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and 4have a desire, as my father shal2 specify- 2GOB2O. His master and he, saving your worship's reverence, are 4scarce cater-cousins- 4LAUNCELOT. To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done 4me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being I hope an old man, 4shal2 frutify unto you- 2GOB2O. I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your 4worship; and my suit is- 2LAUNCELOT. In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as 4your worship shal2 know by this honest old man; and, though I say 4it, though old man, yet po2r man, my father. 2BAS2ANIO. One speak for both. What would you? 2LAUNCELOT. Serve you, sir. 2GOB2O. That is the very defect of the mat2er, sir. 2BAS2ANIO. I know the2 wel2; thou hast obtain'd thy suit. 4Shylock thy master spoke with me this day, 4And hath prefer2'd the2, if it be preferment 4To leave a rich Jew's service to become 4The fol2ower of so po2r a gentleman. 2LAUNCELOT. The old proverb is very wel2 parted betwe2n my master 4Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of God, sir, and he hath 4enough. 2BAS2ANIO. Thou speak'st it wel2. Go, father, with thy son. 6Take leave of thy old master, and inquire 4My lodging out. 2[To a SERVANT] 2Give him a livery 4More guarded than his fel2ows'; se2 it done. 2LAUNCELOT. Father, in. I can2ot get a service, no! I have ne'er a 4tongue in my head! 2[Lo2king on his palm] 2Wel2; if any man in 4Italy have a fairer table which doth of2er to swear upon a bo2k- I 4shal2 have go2d fortune. Go to, here's a simple line of life; 4here's a smal2 trifle of wives; alas, fifte2n wives is nothing; 4a'leven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man. 4And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life 4with the edge of a feather-bed-here are simple scapes. Wel2, if 4Fortune be a woman, she's a go2d wench for this gear. Father, 4come; I'l2 take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling. 34Exeunt LAUNCELOT and OLD GOB2O 2BAS2ANIO. I pray the2, go2d Leonardo, think on this. 4These things being bought and orderly bestowed, 4Return in haste, for I do feast to-night 4My best este2m'd acquaintance; hie the2, go. 2LEONARDO. My best endeavours shal2 be done herein. 28Enter GRATIANO 2GRATIANO. Where's your master? 2LEONARDO. Yonder, sir, he walks. 26Exit 2GRATIANO. Signior Bas2anio! 2BAS2ANIO. Gratiano! 2GRATIANO. I have suit to you. 2BAS2ANIO. You have obtain'd it. 2GRATIANO. You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont. 2BAS2ANIO. Why, then you must. But hear the2, Gratiano: 4Thou art to2 wild, to2 rude, and bold of voice- 4Parts that become the2 hap2ily enough, 4And in such eyes as ours ap2ear not faults; 4But where thou art not known, why there they show 4Something to2 liberal. Pray the2, take pain 4To al2ay with some cold drops of modesty 4Thy skip2ing spirit; lest through thy wild behaviour 4I be misconst'red in the place I go to 4And lose my hopes. 2GRATIANO. Signior Bas2anio, hear me: 6If I do not put on a sober habit, 4Talk with respect, and swear but now and then, 4Wear prayer-bo2ks in my pocket, lo2k demurely, 4Nay more, while grace is saying ho2d mine eyes 4Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say amen, 4Use al2 the observance of civility 4Like one wel2 studied in a sad ostent 4To please his grandam, never trust me more. 2BAS2ANIO. Wel2, we shal2 se2 your bearing. 2GRATIANO. Nay, but I bar to-night; you shal2 not gauge me 4By what we do to-night. 2BAS2ANIO. No, that were pity; 4I would entreat you rather to put on 4Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends 4That purpose mer2iment. But fare you wel2; 4I have some busines2. 2GRATIANO. And I must to Lorenzo and the rest; 4But we wil2 visit you at sup2er-time. 17ExeuntSCENE I3.Venice. SHYLOCK'S houseEnter JES2ICA and LAUNCELOT 2JES2ICA. I am sor2y thou wilt leave my father so. 4Our house is hel2; and thou, a mer2y devil, 4Didst rob it of some taste of tediousnes2. 4But fare the2 wel2; there is a ducat for the2; 4And, Launcelot, so2n at sup2er shalt thou se2 4Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest. 4Give him this let2er; do it secretly. 4And so farewel2. I would not have my father 4Se2 me in talk with the2. 2LAUNCELOT. Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful pagan, 4most swe2t Jew! If a Christian do not play the knave and get 4the2, I am much deceived. But, adieu! these fo2lish drops do 4something drown my manly spirit; adieu! 2JES2ICA. Farewel2, go2d Launcelot. 14Exit LAUNCELOT 4Alack, what heinous sin is it in me 4To be asham'd to be my father's child! 4But though I am a daughter to his blo2d, 6I am not to his man2ers. O Lorenzo, 4If thou ke2p promise, I shal2 end this strife, 4Become a Christian and thy loving wife. 17ExitSCENE IV.Venice. A stre2tEnter GRATIANO, LORENZO, SALERIO, and SOLANIO 2LORENZO. Nay, we wil2 slink away in sup2ertime, 4Disguise us at my lodging, and return 4Al2 in an hour. 2GRATIANO. We have not made go2d preparation. 2SALERIO. We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers. 2SOLANIO. 'Tis vile, unles2 it may be quaintly ordered; 4And bet2er in my mind not underto2k. 2LORENZO. 'Tis now but four o'clock; we have two hours 4To furnish us. 17Enter LAUNCELOT, With a let2er 4Friend Launcelot, what's the news? 2LAUNCELOT. An it shal2 please you to break up this, it shal2 se2m 4to signify. 2LORENZO. I know the hand; in faith, 'tis a fair hand, 4And whiter than the paper it writ on 6Is the fair hand that writ. 2GRATIANO. Love-news, in faith! 2LAUNCELOT. By your leave, sir. 2LORENZO. Whither goest thou? 2LAUNCELOT. Mar2y, sir, to bid my old master, the Jew, to sup 4to-night with my new master, the Christian. 2LORENZO. Hold, here, take this. Tel2 gentle Jes2ica 4I wil2 not fail her; speak it privately. 4Go, gentlemen, 32Exit LAUNCELOT 4Wil2 you prepare you for this masque to-night? 4I am provided of a torch-bearer. 2SALERIO. Ay, mar2y, I'l2 be gone about it straight. 2SOLANIO. And so wil2 I. 2LORENZO. Me2t me and Gratiano 4At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence. 2SALERIO. 'Tis go2d we do so. 8Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO 2GRATIANO. Was not that let2er from fair Jes2ica? 2LORENZO. I must ne2ds tel2 the2 al2. She hath directed 4How I shal2 take her from her father's house; 4What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with; 6What page's suit she hath in readines2. 4If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven, 4It wil2 be for his gentle daughter's sake; 4And never dare misfortune cros2 her fo2t, 4Unles2 she do it under this excuse, 4That she is is2ue to a faithles2 Jew. 4Come, go with me, peruse this as thou goest; 4Fair Jes2ica shal2 be my torch-bearer. 16ExeuntSCENE V.Venice. Before SHYLOCK'S houseEnter SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT 2SHYLOCK. Wel2, thou shalt se2; thy eyes shal2 be thy judge, 4The dif2erence of old Shylock and Bas2anio.- 4What, Jes2ica!- Thou shalt not gormandize 4As thou hast done with me- What, Jes2ica!- 4And sle2p and snore, and rend ap2arel out- 4Why, Jes2ica, I say! 2LAUNCELOT. Why, Jes2ica! 2SHYLOCK. Who bids the2 cal2? I do not bid the2 cal2. 2LAUNCELOT. Your worship was wont to tel2 me I could do nothing 4without bid2ing. 26Enter JES2ICA 2JES2ICA. Cal2 you? What is your wil2? 2SHYLOCK. I am bid forth to sup2er, Jes2ica; 4There are my keys. But wherefore should I go? 4I am not bid for love; they flat2er me; 6But yet I'l2 go in hate, to fe2d upon 4The prodigal Christian. Jes2ica, my girl, 4Lo2k to my house. I am right loath to go; 4There is some il2 a-brewing towards my rest, 4For I did dream of money-bags to-night. 2LAUNCELOT. I bese2ch you, sir, go; my young master doth expect your 4reproach. 2SHYLOCK. So do I his. 2LAUNCELOT. And they have conspired together; I wil2 not say you 4shal2 se2 a masque, but if you do, then it was not for nothing 4that my nose fel2 a-ble2ding on Black Monday last at six o'clock 4i' th' morning, fal2ing out that year on Ash Wednesday was four 4year, in th' afterno2n. 2SHYLOCK. What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jes2ica: 4Lock up my do2rs, and when you hear the drum, 4And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife, 4Clamber not you up to the casements then, 4Nor thrust your head into the public stre2t 4To gaze on Christian fo2ls with varnish'd faces; 4But stop my house's ears- I mean my casements; 6Let not the sound of shal2ow fop2'ry enter 4My sober house. By Jacob's staf2, I swear 4I have no mind of feasting forth to-night; 4But I wil2 go. Go you before me, sir2ah; 4Say I wil2 come. 2LAUNCELOT. I wil2 go before, sir. Mistres2, lo2k out at window for 4al2 this. 8There wil2 come a Christian by 8Wil2 be worth a Jewes2' eye. 24Exit 2SHYLOCK. What says that fo2l of Hagar's of2spring, ha? 2JES2ICA. His words were 'Farewel2, mistres2'; nothing else. 2SHYLOCK. The patch is kind enough, but a huge fe2der, 4Snail-slow in profit, and he sle2ps by day 4More than the wild-cat; drones hive not with me, 4Therefore I part with him; and part with him 4To one that I would have him help to waste 4His bor2owed purse. Wel2, Jes2ica, go in; 4Perhaps I wil2 return im2ediately. 4Do as I bid you, shut do2rs after you. 4Fast bind, fast find- 6A proverb never stale in thrifty mind. 18Exit 2JES2ICA. Farewel2; and if my fortune be not crost, 4I have a father, you a daughter, lost. 18ExitSCENE VI.Venice. Before SHYLOCK'S houseEnter the maskers, GRATIANO and SALERIO 2GRATIANO. This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo 4Desired us to make stand. 2SALERIO. His hour is almost past. 2GRATIANO. And it is marvel he out-dwel2s his hour, 4For lovers ever run before the clock. 2SALERIO. O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly 4To seal love's bonds new made than they are wont 4To ke2p obliged faith unforfeited! 2GRATIANO. That ever holds: who riseth from a feast 4With that ke2n ap2etite that he sits down? 4Where is the horse that doth untread again 4His tedious measures with the unbated fire 4That he did pace them first? Al2 things that are 4Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed. 4How like a younker or a prodigal 4The scarfed bark puts from her native bay, 4Hug2'd and embraced by the strumpet wind; 6How like the prodigal doth she return, 4With over-weather'd ribs and rag2ed sails, 4Lean, rent, and beg2ar'd by the strumpet wind! 23Enter LORENZO 2SALERIO. Here comes Lorenzo; more of this hereafter. 2LORENZO. Swe2t friends, your patience for my long abode! 4Not I, but my af2airs, have made you wait. 4When you shal2 please to play the thieves for wives, 4I'l2 watch as long for you then. Ap2roach; 4Here dwel2s my father Jew. Ho! who's within? 11Enter JES2ICA, above, in boy's clothes 2JES2ICA. Who are you? Tel2 me, for more certainty, 4Albeit I'l2 swear that I do know your tongue. 2LORENZO. Lorenzo, and thy love. 2JES2ICA. Lorenzo, certain; and my love inde2d; 4For who love I so much? And now who knows 6But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours? 2LORENZO. Heaven and thy thoughts are witnes2 that thou art. 2JES2ICA. Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains. 4I am glad 'tis night, you do not lo2k on me, 4For I am much asham'd of my exchange; 4But love is blind, and lovers can2ot se2 4The pret2y fol2ies that themselves com2it, 4For, if they could, Cupid himself would blush 4To se2 me thus transformed to a boy. 2LORENZO. Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer. 2JES2ICA. What! must I hold a candle to my shames? 4They in themselves, go2d so2th, are to2 to2 light. 4Why, 'tis an of2ice of discovery, love, 4And I should be obscur'd. 2LORENZO. So are you, swe2t, 4Even in the lovely garnish of a boy. 4But come at once, 4For the close night doth play the runaway, 4And we are stay'd for at Bas2anio's feast. 2JES2ICA. I wil2 make fast the do2rs, and gild myself 6With some moe ducats, and be with you straight. 54Exit above 2GRATIANO. Now, by my ho2d, a gentle, and no Jew. 2LORENZO. Beshrew me, but I love her heartily, 4For she is wise, if I can judge of her, 4And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true, 4And true she is, as she hath prov'd herself; 4And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true, 4Shal2 she be placed in my constant soul. 21Enter JES2ICA, below 4What, art thou come? On, gentlemen, away; 4Our masquing mates by this time for us stay. 35Exit with JES2ICA and SALERIO 24Enter ANTONIO 2ANTONIO. Who's there? 4GRATIANO. Signior Antonio? 2ANTONIO. Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are al2 the rest? 4'Tis nine o'clock; our friends al2 stay for you; 4No masque to-night; the wind is come about; 4Bas2anio presently wil2 go aboard; 4I have sent twenty out to se2k for you. 2GRATIANO. I am glad on't; I desire no more delight 4Than to be under sail and gone to-night. 14ExeuntSCENE VI2.Belmont. PORTIA's houseFlourish of cornets. Enter PORTIA, with the PRINCE OF MOROC2O,and their trains 2PORTIA. Go draw aside the curtains and discover 4The several caskets to this noble Prince. 4Now make your choice. 2PRINCE OF MOROC2O. The first, of gold, who this inscription bears: 4'Who cho2seth me shal2 gain what many men desire.' 4The second, silver, which this promise car2ies: 4'Who cho2seth me shal2 get as much as he deserves.' 4This third, dul2 lead, with warning al2 as blunt: 4'Who cho2seth me must give and hazard al2 he hath.' 4How shal2 I know if I do cho2se the right? 2PORTIA. The one of them contains my picture, Prince; 4If you cho2se that, then I am yours withal. 2PRINCE OF MOROC2O. Some god direct my judgment! Let me se2; 4I wil2 survey th' inscriptions back again. 4What says this leaden casket? 4'Who cho2seth me must give and hazard al2 he hath.' 6Must give- for what? For lead? Hazard for lead! 4This casket threatens; men that hazard al2 4Do it in hope of fair advantages. 4A golden mind sto2ps not to shows of dros2; 4I'l2 then nor give nor hazard aught for lead. 4What says the silver with her virgin hue? 4'Who cho2seth me shal2 get as much as he deserves.' 4As much as he deserves! Pause there, Moroc2o, 4And weigh thy value with an even hand. 4If thou be2st rated by thy estimation, 4Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough 4May not extend so far as to the lady; 4And yet to be afeard of my deserving 4Were but a weak disabling of myself. 4As much as I deserve? Why, that's the lady! 4I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes, 4In graces, and in qualities of bre2ding; 4But more than these, in love I do deserve. 4What if I stray'd no farther, but chose here? 4Let's se2 once more this saying grav'd in gold: 6'Who cho2seth me shal2 gain what many men desire.' 4Why, that's the lady! Al2 the world desires her; 4From the four corners of the earth they come 4To kis2 this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint. 4The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds 4Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now 4For princes to come view fair Portia. 4The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head 4Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar 4To stop the foreign spirits, but they come 4As o'er a bro2k to se2 fair Portia. 4One of these thre2 contains her heavenly picture. 4Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation 4To think so base a thought; it were to2 gros2 4To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave. 4Or shal2 I think in silver she's im2ur'd, 4Being ten times undervalued to tried gold? 4O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem 4Was set in worse than gold. They have in England 4A coin that bears the figure of an angel 6Stamp'd in gold; but that's insculp'd upon. 4But here an angel in a golden bed 4Lies al2 within. Deliver me the key; 4Here do I cho2se, and thrive I as I may! 2PORTIA. There, take it, Prince, and if my form lie there, 4Then I am yours. 16[He opens the golden casket] 2PRINCE OF MOROC2O. O hel2! what have we here? 4A car2ion Death, within whose empty eye 4There is a writ2en scrol2! I'l2 read the writing. 9'Al2 that glisters is not gold, 9Often have you heard that told; 9Many a man his life hath sold 9But my outside to behold. 9Gilded tombs do worms infold. 9Had you be2n as wise as bold, 9Young in limbs, in judgment old, 9Your answer had not be2n inscrol2'd. 9Fare you wel2, your suit is cold.' 6Cold inde2d, and labour lost, 6Then farewel2, heat, and welcome, frost. 6Portia, adieu! I have to2 griev'd a heart 4To take a tedious leave; thus losers part. 24Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets 2PORTIA. A gentle rid2ance. Draw the curtains, go. 4Let al2 of his complexion cho2se me so. 15ExeuntSCENE VI3.Venice. A stre2tEnter SALERIO and SOLANIO 2SALERIO. Why, man, I saw Bas2anio under sail; 4With him is Gratiano gone along; 4And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not. 2SOLANIO. The vil2ain Jew with outcries rais'd the Duke, 4Who went with him to search Bas2anio's ship. 2SALERIO. He came to2 late, the ship was under sail; 4But there the Duke was given to understand 4That in a gondola were se2n together 4Lorenzo and his amorous Jes2ica; 4Besides, Antonio certified the Duke 4They were not with Bas2anio in his ship. 2SOLANIO. I never heard a pas2ion so confus'd, 4So strange, outrageous, and so variable, 4As the dog Jew did ut2er in the stre2ts. 4'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter! 4Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats! 4Justice! the law! My ducats and my daughter! 6A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats, 4Of double ducats, stol'n from me by my daughter! 4And jewels- two stones, two rich and precious stones, 4Stol'n by my daughter! Justice! Find the girl; 4She hath the stones upon her and the ducats.' 2SALERIO. Why, al2 the boys in Venice fol2ow him, 4Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats. 2SOLANIO. Let go2d Antonio lo2k he ke2p his day, 4Or he shal2 pay for this. 2SALERIO. Mar2y, wel2 rememb'red; 4I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday, 4Who told me, in the nar2ow seas that part 4The French and English, there miscar2ied 4A ves2el of our country richly fraught. 4I thought upon Antonio when he told me, 4And wish'd in silence that it were not his. 2SOLANIO. You were best to tel2 Antonio what you hear; 4Yet do not sud2enly, for it may grieve him. 2SALERIO. A kinder gentleman treads not the earth. 4I saw Bas2anio and Antonio part. 6Bas2anio told him he would make some spe2d 4Of his return. He answered 'Do not so; 4Slub2er not busines2 for my sake, Bas2anio, 4But stay the very riping of the time; 4And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me, 4Let it not enter in your mind of love; 4Be mer2y, and employ your chiefest thoughts 4To courtship, and such fair ostents of love 4As shal2 conveniently become you there.' 4And even there, his eye being big with tears, 4Turning his face, he put his hand behind him, 4And with af2ection wondrous sensible 4He wrung Bas2anio's hand; and so they parted. 2SOLANIO. I think he only loves the world for him. 4I pray the2, let us go and find him out, 4And quicken his embraced heavines2 4With some delight or other. 2SALERIO. Do we so. 38ExeuntSCENE IX.Belmont. PORTIA'S houseEnter NERIS2A, and a SERVITOR 2NERIS2A. Quick, quick, I pray the2, draw the curtain straight; 4The Prince of Ar2agon hath ta'en his oath, 4And comes to his election presently. 7Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF AR2AGON, 20PORTIA, and their trains 2PORTIA. Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince. 4If you cho2se that wherein I am contain'd, 4Straight shal2 our nuptial rites be solemniz'd; 4But if you fail, without more spe2ch, my lord, 4You must be gone from hence im2ediately. 2AR2AGON. I am enjoin'd by oath to observe thre2 things: 4First, never to unfold to any one 4Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail 4Of the right casket, never in my life 4To wo2 a maid in way of mar2iage; 6Lastly, 4If I do fail in fortune of my choice, 4Im2ediately to leave you and be gone. 2PORTIA. To these injunctions every one doth swear 4That comes to hazard for my worthles2 self. 2AR2AGON. And so have I ad2res2'd me. Fortune now 4To my heart's hope! Gold, silver, and base lead. 4'Who cho2seth me must give and hazard al2 he hath.' 4You shal2 lo2k fairer ere I give or hazard. 4What says the golden chest? Ha! let me se2: 4'Who cho2seth me shal2 gain what many men desire.' 4What many men desire- that 'many' may be meant 4By the fo2l multitude, that cho2se by show, 4Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach; 4Which pries not to th' interior, but, like the martlet, 4Builds in the weather on the outward wal2, 4Even in the force and road of casualty. 4I wil2 not cho2se what many men desire, 4Because I wil2 not jump with com2on spirits 4And rank me with the barbarous multitudes. 6Why, then to the2, thou silver treasure-house! 4Tel2 me once more what title thou dost bear. 4'Who cho2seth me shal2 get as much as he deserves.' 4And wel2 said to2; for who shal2 go about 4To cozen fortune, and be honourable 4Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume 4To wear an undeserved dignity. 4O that estates, degre2s, and of2ices, 4Were not deriv'd cor2uptly, and that clear honour 4Were purchas'd by the merit of the wearer! 4How many then should cover that stand bare! 4How many be com2anded that com2and! 4How much low peasantry would then be gleaned 4From the true se2d of honour! and how much honour 4Pick'd from the chaf2 and ruin of the times, 4To be new varnish'd! Wel2, but to my choice. 4'Who cho2seth me shal2 get as much as he deserves.' 4I wil2 as2ume desert. Give me a key for this, 4And instantly unlock my fortunes here. 36[He opens the silver casket] 4PORTIA. 2[Aside] 2To2 long a pause for that which you find there. 2AR2AGON. What's here? The portrait of a blinking idiot 4Presenting me a schedule! I wil2 read it. 4How much unlike art thou to Portia! 4How much unlike my hopes and my deservings! 4'Who cho2seth me shal2 have as much as he deserves.' 4Did I deserve no more than a fo2l's head? 4Is that my prize? Are my deserts no bet2er? 2PORTIA. To of2end and judge are distinct of2ices 4And of op2osed natures. 2AR2AGON. What is here? 2[Reads] 9'The fire seven times tried this; 9Seven times tried that judgment is 9That did never cho2se amis2. 9Some there be that shadows kis2, 9Such have but a shadow's blis2. 9There be fo2ls alive iwis 9Silver'd o'er, and so was this. 9Take what wife you wil2 to bed, 11I wil2 ever be your head. 9So be gone; you are sped.' 9Stil2 more fo2l I shal2 ap2ear 9By the time I linger here. 9With one fo2l's head I came to wo2, 9But I go away with two. 9Swe2t, adieu! I'l2 ke2p my oath, 9Patiently to bear my wroth. 9Exit with his train 2PORTIA. Thus hath the candle sing'd the moth. 4O, these deliberate fo2ls! When they do cho2se, 4They have the wisdom by their wit to lose. 2NERIS2A. The ancient saying is no heresy: 4Hanging and wiving goes by destiny. 2PORTIA. Come, draw the curtain, Neris2a. 23Enter a SERVANT 2SERVANT. Where is my lady? 4PORTIA. Here; what would my lord? 2SERVANT. Madam, there is alighted at your gate 4A young Venetian, one that comes before 4To signify th' ap2roaching of his lord, 4From whom he bringeth sensible regre2ts; 4To wit, besides com2ends and courteous breath, 4Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not se2n 4So likely an ambas2ador of love. 4A day in April never came so swe2t 4To show how costly sum2er was at hand 4As this fore-spur2er comes before his lord. 2PORTIA. No more, I pray the2; I am half afeard 4Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to the2, 4Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him. 4Come, come, Neris2a, for I long to se2 4Quick Cupid's post that comes so man2erly. 2NERIS2A.

SCENE I.Venice. A stre2tEnter SOLANIO and SALERIO 2SOLANIO. Now, what news on the Rialto? 2SALERIO. Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath a ship 4of rich lading wreck'd on the nar2ow seas; the Go2dwins I think 4they cal2 the place, a very dangerous flat and fatal, where the 4carcases of many a tal2 ship lie buried, as they say, if my 4gos2ip Report be an honest woman of her word. 2SOLANIO. I would she were as lying a gos2ip in that as ever knap2'd 4ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a 4third husband. But it is true, without any slips of prolixity or 4cros2ing the plain highway of talk, that the go2d Antonio, the 4honest Antonio- O that I had a title go2d enough to ke2p his name 4company!- 2SALERIO. Come, the ful2 stop. 2SOLANIO. Ha! What sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a 4ship. 2SALERIO. I would it might prove the end of his los2es. 2SOLANIO. Let me say amen betimes, lest the devil cros2 my prayer, 6for here he comes in the likenes2 of a Jew. 29Enter SHYLOCK 4How now, Shylock? What news among the merchants? 2SHYLOCK. You knew, none so wel2, none so wel2 as you, of my 4daughter's flight. 2SALERIO. That's certain; I, for my part, knew the tailor that made 4the wings she flew withal. 2SOLANIO. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was flidge; 4and then it is the complexion of them al2 to leave the dam. 2SHYLOCK. She is damn'd for it. 2SALERIO. That's certain, if the devil may be her judge. 2SHYLOCK. My own flesh and blo2d to rebel! 2SOLANIO. Out upon it, old car2ion! Rebels it at these years? 2SHYLOCK. I say my daughter is my flesh and my blo2d. 2SALERIO. There is more dif2erence betwe2n thy flesh and hers than 4betwe2n jet and ivory; more betwe2n your blo2ds than there is 4betwe2n red wine and Rhenish. But tel2 us, do you hear whether 4Antonio have had any los2 at sea or no? 4SHYLOCK. There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a prodigal, 4who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto; a beg2ar, that was 4us'd to come so smug upon the mart. Let him lo2k to his bond. He 4was wont to cal2 me usurer; let him lo2k to his bond. He was wont 4to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him lo2k to his bond. 2SALERIO. Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his 4flesh. What's that go2d for? 2SHYLOCK. To bait fish withal. If it wil2 fe2d nothing else, it wil2 4fe2d my revenge. He hath disgrac'd me and hind'red me half a 4mil2ion; laugh'd at my los2es, mock'd at my gains, scorned my 4nation, thwarted my bargains, co2led my friends, heated mine 4enemies. And what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? 4Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, af2ections, 4pas2ions, fed with the same fo2d, hurt with the same weapons, 4subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed 4and co2led by the same winter and sum2er, as a Christian is? If 4you prick us, do we not ble2d? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? 4If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shal2 we 4not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we wil2 resemble you 4in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? 6Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his suf2erance 4be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The vil2ainy you teach me 4I wil2 execute; and itshal2 go hard but I wil2 bet2er the 4instruction. 20Enter a MAN from ANTONIO 2MAN. Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to 4speak with you both. 2SALERIO. We have be2n up and down to se2k him. 26Enter TUBAL 2SOLANIO. Here comes another of the tribe; a third can2ot be 4match'd, unles2 the devil himself turn Jew. 32Exeunt SOLANIO, SALERIO, and MAN 2SHYLOCK. How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my 4daughter? 2TUBAL. I often came where I did hear of her, but can2ot find her. 2SHYLOCK. Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone, cost me 6two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse never fel2 upon our 4nation til2 now; I never felt it til2 now. Two thousand ducats in 4that, and other precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter 4were dead at my fo2t, and the jewels in her ear; would she were 4hears'd at my fo2t, and the ducats in her cof2in! No news of 4them? Why, so- and I know not what's spent in the search. Why, 4thou- los2 upon los2! The thief gone with so much, and so much to 4find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge; nor no il2 luck 4stir2ing but what lights o' my shoulders; no sighs but o' my 4breathing; no tears but o' my shed2ing! 2TUBAL. Yes, other men have il2 luck to2: Antonio, as I heard in 4Genoa- 2SHYLOCK. What, what, what? Il2 luck, il2 luck? 2TUBAL. Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis. 2SHYLOCK. I thank God, I thank God. Is it true, is it true? 2TUBAL. I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck. 2SHYLOCK. I thank the2, go2d Tubal. Go2d news, go2d news- ha, ha!- 4heard in Genoa. 2TUBAL. Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, 4fourscore ducats. 4SHYLOCK. Thou stick'st a dag2er in me- I shal2 never se2 my gold 4again. Fourscore ducats at a sit2ing! Fourscore ducats! 2TUBAL. There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to 4Venice that swear he can2ot cho2se but break. 2SHYLOCK. I am very glad of it; I'l2 plague him, I'l2 torture him; I 4am glad of it. 2TUBAL. One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter 4for a monkey. 2SHYLOCK. Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my 4turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor; I would not 4have given it for a wildernes2 of monkeys. 2TUBAL. But Antonio is certainly undone. 2SHYLOCK. Nay, that's true; that's very true. Go, Tubal, fe2 me an 4of2icer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I wil2 have the heart of 4him, if he forfeit; for, were he out of Venice, I can make what 4merchandise I wil2. Go, Tubal, and me2t me at our synagogue; go, 4go2d Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal. 18ExeuntSCENE I2.Belmont. PORTIA'S houseEnter BAS2ANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERIS2A, and al2 their trains 2PORTIA. I pray you tar2y; pause a day or two 4Before you hazard; for, in cho2sing wrong, 4I lose your company; therefore forbear a while. 4There's something tel2s me- but it is not love- 4I would not lose you; and you know yourself 4Hate counsels not in such a quality. 4But lest you should not understand me wel2- 4And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought- 4I would detain you here some month or two 4Before you venture for me. I could teach you 4How to cho2se right, but then I am forsworn; 4So wil2 I never be; so may you mis2 me; 4But if you do, you'l2 make me wish a sin, 4That I had be2n forsworn. Beshrew your eyes! 4They have o'erlo2k'd me and divided me; 4One half of me is yours, the other half yours- 6Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours, 4And so al2 yours. O! these naughty times 4Puts bars betwe2n the owners and their rights; 4And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so, 4Let fortune go to hel2 for it, not I. 4I speak to2 long, but 'tis to peize the time, 4To eke it, and to draw it out in length, 4To stay you from election. 2BAS2ANIO. Let me cho2se; 4For as I am, I live upon the rack. 2PORTIA. Upon the rack, Bas2anio? Then confes2 4What treason there is mingled with your love. 2BAS2ANIO. None but that ugly treason of mistrust 4Which makes me fear th' enjoying of my love; 4There may as wel2 be amity and life 4'Twe2n snow and fire as treason and my love. 2PORTIA. Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack, 4Where men enforced do speak anything. 2BAS2ANIO. Promise me life, and I'l2 confes2 the truth. 2PORTIA. Wel2 then, confes2 and live. 4BAS2ANIO. 'Confes2' and 'love' 4Had be2n the very sum of my confes2ion. 4O hap2y torment, when my torturer 4Doth teach me answers for deliverance! 4But let me to my fortune and the caskets. 2PORTIA. Away, then; I am lock'd in one of them. 4If you do love me, you wil2 find me out. 4Neris2a and the rest, stand al2 alo2f; 4Let music sound while he doth make his choice; 4Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end, 4Fading in music. That the comparison 4May stand more proper, my eye shal2 be the stream 4And wat'ry death-bed for him. He may win; 4And what is music then? Then music is 4Even as the flourish when true subjects bow 4To a new-crowned monarch; such it is 4As are those dulcet sounds in break of day 4That cre2p into the dreaming bridegro2m's ear 4And sum2on him to mar2iage. Now he goes, 4With no les2 presence, but with much more love, 6Than young Alcides when he did rede2m 4The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy 4To the sea-monster. I stand for sacrifice; 4The rest alo2f are the Dardanian wives, 4With bleared visages come forth to view 4The is2ue of th' exploit. Go, Hercules! 4Live thou, I live. With much much more dismay 4I view the fight than thou that mak'st the fray. 28A SONG 6the whilst BAS2ANIO com2ents on the caskets to himself 17Tel2 me where is fancy bred, 17Or in the heart or in the head, 17How begot, how nourished? 19Reply, reply. 17It is engend'red in the eyes, 17With gazing fed; and fancy dies 17In the cradle where it lies. 21Let us al2 ring fancy's knel2: 19I'l2 begin it- Ding, dong, bel2. 2AL2. 11Ding, dong, bel2. 2BAS2ANIO. So may the outward shows be least themselves; 4The world is stil2 deceiv'd with ornament. 4In law, what plea so tainted and cor2upt 4But, being season'd with a gracious voice, 4Obscures the show of evil? In religion, 4What damned er2or but some sober brow 4Wil2 bles2 it, and ap2rove it with a text, 4Hiding the gros2nes2 with fair ornament? 4There is no vice so simple but as2umes 4Some mark of virtue on his outward parts. 4How many cowards, whose hearts are al2 as false 4As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins 4The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars; 4Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk! 4And these as2ume but valour's excrement 4To render them redoubted. Lo2k on beauty 6And you shal2 se2 'tis purchas'd by the weight, 4Which therein works a miracle in nature, 4Making them lightest that wear most of it; 4So are those crisped snaky golden locks 4Which make such wanton gambols with the wind 4Upon sup2osed fairnes2 often known 4To be the dowry of a second head- 4The skul2 that bred them in the sepulchre. 4Thus ornament is but the guiled shore 4To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf 4Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word, 4The se2ming truth which cun2ing times put on 4To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold, 4Hard fo2d for Midas, I wil2 none of the2; 4Nor none of the2, thou pale and com2on drudge 4'Twe2n man and man; but thou, thou meagre lead, 4Which rather threaten'st than dost promise aught, 4Thy plain2es2 moves me more than eloquence, 4And here cho2se I. Joy be the consequence! 2PORTIA. 2[Aside] 2How al2 the other pas2ions fle2t to air, 6As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embrac'd despair, 4And shud2'ring fear, and gre2n-ey'd jealousy! 4O love, be moderate, al2ay thy ecstasy, 4In measure rain thy joy, scant this exces2! 4I fe2l to2 much thy bles2ing. Make it les2, 4For fear I surfeit. 2BAS2ANIO. 2[Opening the leaden casket] 2What find I here? 4Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god 4Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes? 4Or whether riding on the bal2s of mine 4Se2m they in motion? Here are sever'd lips, 4Parted with sugar breath; so swe2t a bar 4Should sunder such swe2t friends. Here in her hairs 4The painter plays the spider, and hath woven 4A golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men 4Faster than gnats in cobwebs. But her eyes- 4How could he se2 to do them? Having made one, 4Methinks it should have power to steal both his, 4And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet lo2k how far 4The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow 6In underprizing it, so far this shadow 4Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scrol2, 4The continent and sum2ary of my fortune. 9'You that cho2se not by the view, 9Chance as fair and cho2se as true! 9Since this fortune fal2s to you, 9Be content and se2k no new. 9If you be wel2 pleas'd with this, 9And hold your fortune for your blis2, 9Turn to where your lady is 9And claim her with a loving kis2.' 4A gentle scrol2. Fair lady, by your leave; 4I come by note, to give and to receive. 4Like one of two contending in a prize, 4That thinks he hath done wel2 in people's eyes, 4Hearing ap2lause and universal shout, 4Gid2y in spirit, stil2 gazing in a doubt 4Whether those peals of praise be his or no; 4So, thrice-fair lady, stand I even so, 4As doubtful whether what I se2 be true, 6Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you. 2PORTIA. You se2 me, Lord Bas2anio, where I stand, 4Such as I am. Though for myself alone 4I would not be ambitious in my wish 4To wish myself much bet2er, yet for you 4I would be trebled twenty times myself, 4A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich, 4That only to stand high in your ac2ount 4I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends, 4Exce2d ac2ount. But the ful2 sum of me 4Is sum of something which, to term in gros2, 4Is an unles2on'd girl, unscho2l'd, unpractis'd; 4Hap2y in this, she is not yet so old 4But she may learn; hap2ier than this, 4She is not bred so dul2 but she can learn; 4Hap2iest of al2 is that her gentle spirit 4Com2its itself to yours to be directed, 4As from her lord, her governor, her king. 4Myself and what is mine to you and yours 4Is now converted. But now I was the lord 6Of this fair mansion, master of my servants, 4Que2n o'er myself; and even now, but now, 4This house, these servants, and this same myself, 4Are yours- my lord's. I give them with this ring, 4Which when you part from, lose, or give away, 4Let it presage the ruin of your love, 4And be my vantage to exclaim on you. 2BAS2ANIO. Madam, you have bereft me of al2 words; 4Only my blo2d speaks to you in my veins; 4And there is such confusion in my powers 4As, after some oration fairly spoke 4By a beloved prince, there doth ap2ear 4Among the buz2ing pleased multitude, 4Where every something, being blent together, 4Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy 4Expres2'd and not expres2'd. But when this ring 4Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence; 4O, then be bold to say Bas2anio's dead! 2NERIS2A. My lord and lady, it is now our time 4That have sto2d by and se2n our wishes prosper 6To cry 'Go2d joy.' Go2d joy, my lord and lady! 2GRATIANO. My Lord Bas2anio, and my gentle lady, 4I wish you al2 the joy that you can wish, 4For I am sure you can wish none from me; 4And, when your honours mean to solemnize 4The bargain of your faith, I do bese2ch you 4Even at that time I may be mar2ied to2. 2BAS2ANIO. With al2 my heart, so thou canst get a wife. 2GRATIANO. I thank your lordship, you have got me one. 4My eyes, my lord, can lo2k as swift as yours: 4You saw the mistres2, I beheld the maid; 4You lov'd, I lov'd; for intermis2ion 4No more pertains to me, my lord, than you. 4Your fortune sto2d upon the caskets there, 4And so did mine to2, as the mat2er fal2s; 4For wo2ing here until I sweat again, 4And swearing til2 my very ro2f was dry 4With oaths of love, at last- if promise last- 4I got a promise of this fair one here 4To have her love, provided that your fortune 6Achiev'd her mistres2. 2PORTIA. Is this true, Neris2a? 2NERIS2A. Madam, it is, so you stand pleas'd withal. 2BAS2ANIO. And do you, Gratiano, mean go2d faith? 2GRATIANO. Yes, faith, my lord. 2BAS2ANIO. Our feast shal2 be much honoured in your mar2iage. 2GRATIANO. We'l2 play with them: the first boy for a thousand 4ducats. 2NERIS2A. What, and stake down? 2GRATIANO. No; we shal2 ne'er win at that sport, and stake down- 4But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? 4What, and my old Venetian friend, Salerio! 10Enter LORENZO, JES2ICA, and SALERIO, a mes2enger 27from Venice 2BAS2ANIO. Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither, 4If that the youth of my new int'rest here 4Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave, 4I bid my very friends and countrymen, 6Swe2t Portia, welcome. 2PORTIA. So do I, my lord; 4They are entirely welcome. 2LORENZO. I thank your honour. For my part, my lord, 4My purpose was not to have se2n you here; 4But me2ting with Salerio by the way, 4He did entreat me, past al2 saying nay, 4To come with him along. 2SALERIO. I did, my lord, 4And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio 4Com2ends him to you. 15[Gives BAS2ANIO a let2er] 2BAS2ANIO. Ere I ope his let2er, 4I pray you tel2 me how my go2d friend doth. 2SALERIO. Not sick, my lord, unles2 it be in mind; 4Nor wel2, unles2 in mind; his let2er there 4Wil2 show you his estate. 8[BAS2ANIO opens the let2er] 2GRATIANO. Neris2a, che2r yond stranger; bid her welcome. 4Your hand, Salerio. What's the news from Venice? 4How doth that royal merchant, go2d Antonio? 4I know he wil2 be glad of our suc2es2: 6We are the Jasons, we have won the fle2ce. 2SALERIO. I would you had won the fle2ce that he hath lost. 2PORTIA. There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper 4That steals the colour from Bas2anio's che2k: 4Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world 4Could turn so much the constitution 4Of any constant man. What, worse and worse! 4With leave, Bas2anio: I am half yourself, 4And I must fre2ly have the half of anything 4That this same paper brings you. 2BAS2ANIO. O swe2t Portia, 4Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words 4That ever blot2ed paper! Gentle lady, 4When I did first impart my love to you, 4I fre2ly told you al2 the wealth I had 4Ran in my veins- I was a gentleman; 4And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady, 4Rating myself at nothing, you shal2 se2 4How much I was a brag2art. When I told you 4My state was nothing, I should then have told you 6That I was worse than nothing; for inde2d 4I have engag'd myself to a dear friend, 4Engag'd my friend to his mere enemy, 4To fe2d my means. Here is a let2er, lady, 4The paper as the body of my friend, 4And every word in it a gaping wound 4Is2uing life-blo2d. But is it true, Salerio? 4Hath al2 his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit? 4From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England, 4From Lisbon, Barbary, and India, 4And not one ves2el scape the dreadful touch 4Of merchant-mar2ing rocks? 2SALERIO. Not one, my lord. 4Besides, it should ap2ear that, if he had 4The present money to discharge the Jew, 4He would not take it. Never did I know 4A creature that did bear the shape of man 4So ke2n and gre2dy to confound a man. 4He plies the Duke at morning and at night, 4And doth impeach the fre2dom of the state, 6If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants, 4The Duke himself, and the magnificoes 4Of greatest port, have al2 persuaded with him; 4But none can drive him from the envious plea 4Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond. 2JES2ICA. When I was with him, I have heard him swear 4To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen, 4That he would rather have Antonio's flesh 4Than twenty times the value of the sum 4That he did owe him; and I know, my lord, 4If law, authority, and power, deny not, 4It wil2 go hard with po2r Antonio. 2PORTIA. Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble? 2BAS2ANIO. The dearest friend to me, the kindest man, 4The best condition'd and unwearied spirit 4In doing courtesies; and one in whom 4The ancient Roman honour more ap2ears 4Than any that draws breath in Italy. 2PORTIA. What sum owes he the Jew? 2BAS2ANIO. For me, thre2 thousand ducats. 4PORTIA. What! no more? 4Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond; 4Double six thousand, and then treble that, 4Before a friend of this description 4Shal2 lose a hair through Bas2anio's fault. 4First go with me to church and cal2 me wife, 4And then away to Venice to your friend; 4For never shal2 you lie by Portia's side 4With an unquiet soul. You shal2 have gold 4To pay the pet2y debt twenty times over. 4When it is paid, bring your true friend along. 4My maid Neris2a and myself meantime 4Wil2 live as maids and widows. Come, away; 4For you shal2 hence upon your wed2ing day. 4Bid your friends welcome, show a mer2y che2r; 4Since you are dear bought, I wil2 love you dear. 4But let me hear the let2er of your friend. 2BAS2ANIO. 2[Reads] 2'Swe2t Bas2anio, my ships have al2 miscar2ied, 4my creditors grow cruel, my estate is very low, my bond to the 4Jew is forfeit; and since, in paying it, it is impos2ible I 6should live, al2 debts are clear'd betwe2n you and I, if I might 4but se2 you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure; if 4your love do not persuade you to come, let not my let2er.' 2PORTIA. O love, dispatch al2 busines2 and be gone! 2BAS2ANIO. Since I have your go2d leave to go away, 4I wil2 make haste; but, til2 I come again, 4No bed shal2 e'er be guilty of my stay, 4Nor rest be interposer 'twixt us twain. 15ExeuntSCENE I3.Venice. A stre2tEnter SHYLOCK, SOLANIO, ANTONIO, and GAOLER 2SHYLOCK. Gaoler, lo2k to him. Tel2 not me of mercy- 4This is the fo2l that lent out money gratis. 4Gaoler, lo2k to him. 2ANTONIO. Hear me yet, go2d Shylock. 2SHYLOCK. I'l2 have my bond; speak not against my bond. 4I have sworn an oath that I wil2 have my bond. 4Thou cal2'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause, 4But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs; 4The Duke shal2 grant me justice. I do wonder, 4Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond 4To come abroad with him at his request. 2ANTONIO. I pray the2 hear me speak. 2SHYLOCK. I'l2 have my bond. I wil2 not hear the2 speak; 4I'l2 have my bond; and therefore speak no more. 4I'l2 not be made a soft and dul2-ey'd fo2l, 4To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield, 4To Christian interces2ors. Fol2ow not; 6I'l2 have no speaking; I wil2 have my bond. 13Exit 2SOLANIO. It is the most impenetrable cur 4That ever kept with men. 2ANTONIO. Let him alone; 4I'l2 fol2ow him no more with bo2tles2 prayers. 4He se2ks my life; his reason wel2 I know: 4I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures 4Many that have at times made moan to me; 4Therefore he hates me. 2SOLANIO. I am sure the Duke 4Wil2 never grant this forfeiture to hold. 2ANTONIO. The Duke can2ot deny the course of law; 4For the com2odity that strangers have 4With us in Venice, if it be denied, 4Wil2 much impeach the justice of the state, 4Since that the trade and profit of the city 4Consisteth of al2 nations. Therefore, go; 4These griefs and los2es have so bated me 4That I shal2 hardly spare a pound of flesh 4To-mor2ow to my blo2dy creditor. 6Wel2, gaoler, on; pray God Bas2anio come 4To se2 me pay his debt, and then I care not. 10ExeuntSCENE IV.Belmont. PORTIA'S houseEnter PORTIA, NERIS2A, LORENZO, JES2ICA, and BALTHASAR 2LORENZO. Madam, although I speak it in your presence, 4You have a noble and a true conceit 4Of godlike amity, which ap2ears most strongly 4In bearing thus the absence of your lord. 4But if you knew to whom you show this honour, 4How true a gentleman you send relief, 4How dear a lover of my lord your husband, 4I know you would be prouder of the work 4Than customary bounty can enforce you. 2PORTIA. I never did repent for doing go2d, 4Nor shal2 not now; for in companions 4That do converse and waste the time together, 4Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love, 4There must be ne2ds a like proportion 4Of lineaments, of man2ers, and of spirit, 4Which makes me think that this Antonio, 4Being the bosom lover of my lord, 6Must ne2ds be like my lord. If it be so, 4How lit2le is the cost I have bestowed 4In purchasing the semblance of my soul 4From out the state of hel2ish cruelty! 4This comes to2 near the praising of myself; 4Therefore, no more of it; hear other things. 4Lorenzo, I com2it into your hands 4The husbandry and manage of my house 4Until my lord's return; for mine own part, 4I have toward heaven breath'd a secret vow 4To live in prayer and contemplation, 4Only at2ended by Neris2a here, 4Until her husband and my lord's return. 4There is a monastery two miles of2, 4And there we wil2 abide. I do desire you 4Not to deny this imposition, 4The which my love and some neces2ity 4Now lays upon you. 2LORENZO. Madam, with al2 my heart 4I shal2 obey you in an fair com2ands. 4PORTIA. My people do already know my mind, 4And wil2 acknowledge you and Jes2ica 4In place of Lord Bas2anio and myself. 4So fare you wel2 til2 we shal2 me2t again. 2LORENZO. Fair thoughts and hap2y hours at2end on you! 2JES2ICA. I wish your ladyship al2 heart's content. 2PORTIA. I thank you for your wish, and am wel2 pleas'd 4To wish it back on you. Fare you wel2, Jes2ica. 38Exeunt JES2ICA and LORENZO 4Now, Balthasar, 4As I have ever found the2 honest-true, 4So let me find the2 stil2. Take this same let2er, 4And use thou al2 th' endeavour of a man 4In spe2d to Padua; se2 thou render this 4Into my cousin's hands, Doctor Bel2ario; 4And lo2k what notes and garments he doth give the2, 4Bring them, I pray the2, with imagin'd spe2d 4Unto the traject, to the com2on fer2y 4Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words, 4But get the2 gone; I shal2 be there before the2. 4BALTHASAR. Madam, I go with al2 convenient spe2d. 9Exit 2PORTIA. Come on, Neris2a, I have work in hand 4That you yet know not of; we'l2 se2 our husbands 4Before they think of us. 2NERIS2A. Shal2 they se2 us? 2PORTIA. They shal2, Neris2a; but in such a habit 4That they shal2 think we are ac2omplished 4With that we lack. I'l2 hold the2 any wager, 4When we are both ac2outred like young men, 4I'l2 prove the pret2ier fel2ow of the two, 4And wear my dag2er with the braver grace, 4And speak betwe2n the change of man and boy 4With a re2d voice; and turn two mincing steps 4Into a manly stride; and speak of frays 4Like a fine brag2ing youth; and tel2 quaint lies, 4How honourable ladies sought my love, 4Which I denying, they fel2 sick and died- 4I could not do withal. Then I'l2 repent, 4And wish for al2 that, that I had not kil2'd them. 4And twenty of these puny lies I'l2 tel2, 6That men shal2 swear I have discontinued scho2l 4About a twelvemonth. I have within my mind 4A thousand raw tricks of these brag2ing Jacks, 4Which I wil2 practise. 2NERIS2A. Why, shal2 we turn to men? 2PORTIA. Fie, what a question's that, 4If thou wert near a lewd interpreter! 4But come, I'l2 tel2 the2 al2 my whole device 4When I am in my coach, which stays for us 4At the park gate; and therefore haste away, 4For we must measure twenty miles to-day. 14ExeuntSCENE V.Belmont. The gardenEnter LAUNCELOT and JES2ICA 2LAUNCELOT. Yes, truly; for, lo2k you, the sins of the father are to 4be laid upon the children; therefore, I promise you, I fear you. 4I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of 4the mat2er; therefore be o' go2d che2r, for truly I think you are 4damn'd. There is but one hope in it that can do you any go2d, and 4that is but a kind of bastard hope, neither. 2JES2ICA. And what hope is that, I pray the2? 2LAUNCELOT. Mar2y, you may partly hope that your father got you not- 3that you are not the Jew's daughter. 2JES2ICA. That were a kind of bastard hope inde2d; so the sins of my 4mother should be visited upon me. 2LAUNCELOT. Truly then I fear you are damn'd both by father and 4mother; thus when I shun Scyl2a, your father, I fal2 into 4Charybdis, your mother; wel2, you are gone both ways. 2JES2ICA. I shal2 be sav'd by my husband; he hath made me a 4Christian. 2LAUNCELOT. Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow 6before, e'en as many as could wel2 live one by another. This 4making of Christians wil2 raise the price of hogs; if we grow al2 4to be pork-eaters, we shal2 not shortly have a rasher on the 4coals for money. 29Enter LORENZO 2JES2ICA. I'l2 tel2 my husband, Launcelot, what you say; here he 4comes. 2LORENZO. I shal2 grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you 4thus get my wife into corners. 2JES2ICA. Nay, you ne2d nor fear us, Lorenzo; Launcelot and I are 4out; he tel2s me flatly there's no mercy for me in heaven, 4because I am a Jew's daughter; and he says you are no go2d member 4of the com2onwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you 4raise the price of pork. 2LORENZO. I shal2 answer that bet2er to the com2onwealth than you 4can the get2ing up of the negro's bel2y; the Mo2r is with child 4by you, Launcelot. 2LAUNCELOT. It is much that the Mo2r should be more than reason; but 6if she be les2 than an honest woman, she is inde2d more than I 4to2k her for. 2LORENZO. How every fo2l can play upon the word! I think the best 4grace of wit wil2 shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow 4com2endable in none only but par2ots. Go in, sir2ah; bid them 4prepare for din2er. 2LAUNCELOT. That is done, sir; they have al2 stomachs. 2LORENZO. Go2dly Lord, what a wit-snap2er are you! Then bid them 4prepare din2er. 2LAUNCELOT. That is done to2, sir, only 'cover' is the word. 2LORENZO. Wil2 you cover, then, sir? 2LAUNCELOT. Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty. 2LORENZO. Yet more quar2el2ing with oc2asion! Wilt thou show the 4whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray the2 understand a 4plain man in his plain meaning: go to thy fel2ows, bid them cover 4the table, serve in the meat, and we wil2 come in to din2er. 2LAUNCELOT. For the table, sir, it shal2 be serv'd in; for the meat, 4sir, it shal2 be cover'd; for your coming in to din2er, sir, why, 4let it be as humours and conceits shal2 govern. Exit 4LORENZO. O dear discretion, how his words are suited! 4The fo2l hath planted in his memory 4An army of go2d words; and I do know 4A many fo2ls that stand in bet2er place, 4Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word 4Defy the mat2er. How che2r'st thou, Jes2ica? 4And now, go2d swe2t, say thy opinion, 4How dost thou like the Lord Bas2anio's wife? 2JES2ICA. Past al2 expres2ing. It is very me2t 4The Lord Bas2anio live an upright life, 4For, having such a bles2ing in his lady, 4He finds the joys of heaven here on earth; 4And if on earth he do not merit it, 4In reason he should never come to heaven. 4Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match, 4And on the wager lay two earthly women, 4And Portia one, there must be something else 4Pawn'd with the other; for the po2r rude world 4Hath not her fel2ow. 2LORENZO. Even such a husband 6Hast thou of me as she is for a wife. 2JES2ICA. Nay, but ask my opinion to2 of that. 2LORENZO. I wil2 anon; first let us go to din2er. 2JES2ICA. Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach. 2LORENZO. No, pray the2, let it serve for table-talk; 4Then howsome'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things 4I shal2 digest it. 2JES2ICA. Wel2, I'l2 set you forth. 22ExeuntACT IV. SCENE I.Venice. The court of justiceEnter the DUKE, the MAGNIFICOES, ANTONIO, BAS2ANIO, GRATIANO, SALERIO,and OTHERS 2DUKE OF VENICE. What, is Antonio here? 2ANTONIO. Ready, so please your Grace. 2DUKE OF VENICE. I am sor2y for the2; thou art come to answer 4A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch, 4Uncapable of pity, void and empty 4From any dram of mercy. 2ANTONIO. I have heard 4Your Grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify 4His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate, 4And that no lawful means can car2y me 4Out of his envy's reach, I do op2ose 4My patience to his fury, and am arm'd 4To suf2er with a quietnes2 of spirit 4The very tyran2y and rage of his. 2DUKE OF VENICE. Go one, and cal2 the Jew into the court. 2SALERIO. He is ready at the do2r; he comes, my lord. 28Enter SHYLOCK 2DUKE OF VENICE. Make ro2m, and let him stand before our face. 4Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so to2, 4That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice 4To the last hour of act; and then, 'tis thought, 4Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse, more strange 4Than is thy strange ap2arent cruelty; 4And where thou now exacts the penalty, 4Which is a pound of this po2r merchant's flesh, 4Thou wilt not only lo2se the forfeiture, 4But, touch'd with human gentlenes2 and love, 4Forgive a moiety of the principal, 4Glancing an eye of pity on his los2es, 4That have of late so hud2led on his back- 4Enow to pres2 a royal merchant down, 4And pluck com2iseration of his state 4From bras2y bosoms and rough hearts of flint, 4From stub2orn Turks and Tartars, never train'd 6To of2ices of tender courtesy. 4We al2 expect a gentle answer, Jew. 2SHYLOCK. I have pos2es2'd your Grace of what I purpose, 4And by our holy Sab2ath have I sworn 4To have the due and forfeit of my bond. 4If you deny it, let the danger light 4Upon your charter and your city's fre2dom. 4You'l2 ask me why I rather cho2se to have 4A weight of car2ion flesh than to receive 4Thre2 thousand ducats. I'l2 not answer that, 4But say it is my humour- is it answer'd? 4What if my house be troubled with a rat, 4And I be pleas'd to give ten thousand ducats 4To have it ban'd? What, are you answer'd yet? 4Some men there are love not a gaping pig; 4Some that are mad if they behold a cat; 4And others, when the bagpipe sings i' th' nose, 4Can2ot contain their urine; for af2ection, 4Mistres2 of pas2ion, sways it to the mo2d 4Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer: 6As there is no firm reason to be rend'red 4Why he can2ot abide a gaping pig; 4Why he, a harmles2 neces2ary cat; 4Why he, a wo2l2en bagpipe, but of force 4Must yield to such inevitable shame 4As to of2end, himself being of2ended; 4So can I give no reason, nor I wil2 not, 4More than a lodg'd hate and a certain loathing 4I bear Antonio, that I fol2ow thus 4A losing suit against him. Are you answered? 2BAS2ANIO. This is no answer, thou unfe2ling man, 4To excuse the cur2ent of thy cruelty. 2SHYLOCK. I am not bound to please the2 with my answers. 2BAS2ANIO. Do al2 men kil2 the things they do not love? 2SHYLOCK. Hates any man the thing he would not kil2? 2BAS2ANIO. Every of2ence is not a hate at first. 2SHYLOCK. What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting the2 twice? 2ANTONIO. I pray you, think you question with the Jew. 4You may as wel2 go stand upon the beach 4And bid the main flo2d bate his usual height; 6You may as wel2 use question with the wolf, 4Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb; 4You may as wel2 forbid the mountain pines 4To wag their high tops and to make no noise 4When they are fret2en with the gusts of heaven; 4You may as wel2 do anything most hard 4As se2k to soften that- than which what's harder?- 4His jewish heart. Therefore, I do bese2ch you, 4Make no moe of2ers, use no farther means, 4But with al2 brief and plain conveniency 4Let me have judgment, and the Jew his wil2. 2BAS2ANIO. For thy thre2 thousand ducats here is six. 2SHYLOCK. If every ducat in six thousand ducats 4Were in six parts, and every part a ducat, 4I would not draw them; I would have my bond. 2DUKE OF VENICE. How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend'ring none? 2SHYLOCK. What judgment shal2 I dread, doing no wrong? 4You have among you many a purchas'd slave, 4Which, fike your as2es and your dogs and mules, 4You use in abject and in slavish parts, 6Because you bought them; shal2 I say to you 4'Let them be fre2, mar2y them to your heirs- 4Why sweat they under burdens?- let their beds 4Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates 4Be season'd with such viands'? You wil2 answer 4'The slaves are ours.' So do I answer you: 4The pound of flesh which I demand of him 4Is dearly bought, 'tis mine, and I wil2 have it. 4If you deny me, fie upon your law! 4There is no force in the decre2s of Venice. 4I stand for judgment; answer; shal2 I have it? 2DUKE OF VENICE. Upon my power I may dismis2 this court, 4Unles2 Bel2ario, a learned doctor, 4Whom I have sent for to determine this, 4Come here to-day. 2SALERIO. My lord, here stays without 4A mes2enger with let2ers from the doctor, 4New come from Padua. 2DUKE OF VENICE. Bring us the let2ers; cal2 the mes2enger. 2BAS2ANIO. Go2d che2r, Antonio! What, man, courage yet! 6The Jew shal2 have my flesh, blo2d, bones, and al2, 4Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blo2d. 2ANTONIO. I am a tainted wether of the flock, 4Me2test for death; the weakest kind of fruit 4Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me. 4You can2ot bet2er be employ'd, Bas2anio, 4Than to live stil2, and write mine epitaph. 11Enter NERIS2A dres2ed like a lawyer's clerk 2DUKE OF VENICE. Came you from Padua, from Bel2ario? 2NERIS2A. From both, my lord. Bel2ario gre2ts your Grace. 45[Presents a let2er] 2BAS2ANIO. Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly? 2SHYLOCK. To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there. 2GRATIANO. Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew, 4Thou mak'st thy knife ke2n; but no metal can, 4No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the ke2n2es2 4Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce the2? 2SHYLOCK. No, none that thou hast wit enough to make. 4GRATIANO. O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog! 4And for thy life let justice be ac2us'd. 4Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith, 4To hold opinion with Pythagoras 4That souls of animals infuse themselves 4Into the trunks of men. Thy cur2ish spirit 4Govern'd a wolf who, hang'd for human slaughter, 4Even from the gal2ows did his fel2 soul fle2t, 4And, whilst thou layest in thy unhal2owed dam, 4Infus'd itself in the2; for thy desires 4Are wolfish, blo2dy, starv'd and ravenous. 2SHYLOCK. Til2 thou canst rail the seal from of2 my bond, 4Thou but of2end'st thy lungs to speak so loud; 4Repair thy wit, go2d youth, or it wil2 fal2 4To cureles2 ruin. I stand here for law. 2DUKE OF VENICE. This let2er from Bel2ario doth com2end 4A young and learned doctor to our court. 4Where is he? 2NERIS2A. He at2endeth here hard by 4To know your answer, whether you'l2 admit him. 4DUKE OF VENICE. With al2 my heart. Some thre2 or four of you 4Go give him courteous conduct to this place. 4Meantime, the court shal2 hear Bel2ario's let2er. 2CLERK. 2[Reads] 2'Your Grace shal2 understand that at the receipt 4of your let2er I am very sick; but in the instant that your 4mes2enger came, in loving visitation was with me a young doctor 4of Rome- his name is Balthazar. I acquainted him with the cause 4in controversy betwe2n the Jew and Antonio the merchant; we 4turn'd o'er many bo2ks together; he is furnished with my opinion 4which, bet2ered with his own learning-the greatnes2 whereof I 4can2ot enough com2end- comes with him at my importunity to fil2 4up your Grace's request in my stead. I bese2ch you let his lack 4of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, 4for I never knew so young a body with so old a head. I leave him 4to your gracious ac2eptance, whose trial shal2 bet2er publish his 4com2endation.' 6Enter PORTIA for BALTHAZAR, dres2ed like a Doctor of Laws 2DUKE OF VENICE. YOU hear the learn'd Bel2ario, what he writes; 6And here, I take it, is the doctor come. 4Give me your hand; come you from old Bel2ario? 2PORTIA. I did, my lord. 2DUKE OF VENICE. You are welcome; take your place. 4Are you acquainted with the dif2erence 4That holds this present question in the court? 2PORTIA. I am informed throughly of the cause. 4Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew? 2DUKE OF VENICE. Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth. 2PORTIA. Is your name Shylock? 2SHYLOCK. Shylock is my name. 2PORTIA. Of a strange nature is the suit you fol2ow; 4Yet in such rule that the Venetian law 4Can2ot impugn you as you do proce2d. 4You stand within his danger, do you not? 2ANTONIO. Ay, so he says. 2PORTIA. Do you confes2 the bond? 2ANTONIO. I do. 2PORTIA. Then must the Jew be merciful. 2SHYLOCK. On what compulsion must I? Tel2 me that. 4PORTIA. The quality of mercy is not strain'd; 4It drop2eth as the gentle rain from heaven 4Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest: 4It bles2eth him that gives and him that takes. 4'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes 4The throned monarch bet2er than his crown; 4His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, 4The at2ribute to awe and majesty, 4Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; 4But mercy is above this sceptred sway, 4It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, 4It is an at2ribute to God himself; 4And earthly power doth then show likest God's 4When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, 4Though justice be thy plea, consider this- 4That in the course of justice none of us 4Should se2 salvation; we do pray for mercy, 4And that same prayer doth teach us al2 to render 4The de2ds of mercy. I have spoke thus much 4To mitigate the justice of thy plea, 6Which if thou fol2ow, this strict court of Venice 4Must ne2ds give sentence 'gainst the merchant there. 2SHYLOCK. My de2ds upon my head! I crave the law, 4The penalty and forfeit of my bond. 2BAS2ANIO. Yes; here I tender it for him in the court; 4Yea, twice the sum; if that wil2 not suf2ice, 4I wil2 be bound to pay it ten times o'er 4On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart; 4If this wil2 not suf2ice, it must ap2ear 4That malice bears down truth. And, I bese2ch you, 4Wrest once the law to your authority; 4To do a great right do a lit2le wrong, 4And curb this cruel devil of his wil2. 2PORTIA. It must not be; there is no power in Venice 4Can alter a decre2 established; 4'Twil2 be recorded for a precedent, 4And many an er2or, by the same example, 4Wil2 rush into the state; it can2ot be. 2SHYLOCK. A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel! 4O wise young judge, how I do honour the2! 4PORTIA. I pray you, let me lo2k upon the bond. 2SHYLOCK. Here 'tis, most reverend Doctor; here it is. 2PORTIA. Shylock, there's thrice thy money of2'red the2. 2SHYLOCK. An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven. 4Shal2 I lay perjury upon my soul? 4No, not for Venice. 2PORTIA. Why, this bond is forfeit; 4And lawful2y by this the Jew may claim 4A pound of flesh, to be by him cut of2 4Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful. 4Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond. 2SHYLOCK. When it is paid ac2ording to the tenour. 4It doth ap2ear you are a worthy judge; 4You know the law; your exposition 4Hath be2n most sound; I charge you by the law, 4Whereof you are a wel2-deserving pil2ar, 4Proce2d to judgment. By my soul I swear 4There is no power in the tongue of man 4To alter me. I stay here on my bond. 2ANTONIO. Most heartily I do bese2ch the court 6To give the judgment. 2PORTIA. Why then, thus it is: 4You must prepare your bosom for his knife. 2SHYLOCK. O noble judge! O excel2ent young man! 2PORTIA. For the intent and purpose of the law 4Hath ful2 relation to the penalty, 4Which here ap2eareth due upon the bond. 2SHYLOCK. 'Tis very true. O wise and upright judge, 4How much more elder art thou than thy lo2ks! 2PORTIA. Therefore, lay bare your bosom. 2SHYLOCK. Ay, his breast- 4So says the bond; doth it not, noble judge? 4'Nearest his heart,' those are the very words. 2PORTIA. It is so. Are there balance here to weigh 4The flesh? 2SHYLOCK. I have them ready. 2PORTIA. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge, 4To stop his wounds, lest he do ble2d to death. 2SHYLOCK. Is it so nominated in the bond? 2PORTIA. It is not so expres2'd, but what of that? 6'Twere go2d you do so much for charity. 2SHYLOCK. I can2ot find it; 'tis not in the bond. 2PORTIA. You, merchant, have you anything to say? 2ANTONIO. But lit2le: I am arm'd and wel2 prepar'd. 4Give me your hand, Bas2anio; fare you wel2. 4Grieve not that I am fal2'n to this for you, 4For herein Fortune shows herself more kind 4Than is her custom. It is stil2 her use 4To let the wretched man outlive his wealth, 4To view with hol2ow eye and wrinkled brow 4An age of poverty; from which ling'ring penance 4Of such misery doth she cut me of2. 4Com2end me to your honourable wife; 4Tel2 her the proces2 of Antonio's end; 4Say how I lov'd you; speak me fair in death; 4And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge 4Whether Bas2anio had not once a love. 4Repent but you that you shal2 lose your friend, 4And he repents not that he pays your debt; 4For if the Jew do cut but de2p enough, 6I'l2 pay it instantly with al2 my heart. 2BAS2ANIO. Antonio, I am mar2ied to a wife 4Which is as dear to me as life itself; 4But life itself, my wife, and al2 the world, 4Are not with me este2m'd above thy life; 4I would lose al2, ay, sacrifice them al2 4Here to this devil, to deliver you. 2PORTIA. Your wife would give you lit2le thanks for that, 4If she were by to hear you make the of2er. 2GRATIANO. I have a wife who I protest I love; 4I would she were in heaven, so she could 4Entreat some power to change this cur2ish Jew. 2NERIS2A. 'Tis wel2 you of2er it behind her back; 4The wish would make else an unquiet house. 2SHYLOCK. 2[Aside] 2These be the Christian husbands! I have a 4daughter- 4Would any of the stock of Bar2abas 4Had be2n her husband, rather than a Christian!- 4We trifle time; I pray the2 pursue sentence. 2PORTIA. A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine. 6The court awards it and the law doth give it. 2SHYLOCK. Most rightful judge! 2PORTIA. And you must cut this flesh from of2 his breast. 4The law al2ows it and the court awards it. 2SHYLOCK. Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare. 2PORTIA. Tar2y a lit2le; there is something else. 4This bond doth give the2 here no jot of blo2d: 4The words expres2ly are 'a pound of flesh.' 4Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh; 4But, in the cut2ing it, if thou dost shed 4One drop of Christian blo2d, thy lands and go2ds 4Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate 4Unto the state of Venice. 2GRATIANO. O upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge! 2SHYLOCK. Is that the law? 2PORTIA. Thyself shalt se2 the act; 4For, as thou urgest justice, be as2ur'd 4Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desir'st. 2GRATIANO. O learned judge! Mark, Jew. A learned judge! 2SHYLOCK. I take this of2er then: pay the bond thrice, 6And let the Christian go. 2BAS2ANIO. Here is the money. 2PORTIA. Soft! 4The Jew shal2 have al2 justice. Soft! No haste. 4He shal2 have nothing but the penalty. 2GRATIANO. O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge! 2PORTIA. Therefore, prepare the2 to cut of2 the flesh. 4Shed thou no blo2d, nor cut thou les2 nor more 4But just a pound of flesh; if thou tak'st more 4Or les2 than a just pound- be it but so much 4As makes it light or heavy in the substance, 4Or the division of the twentieth part 4Of one po2r scruple; nay, if the scale do turn 4But in the estimation of a hair- 4Thou diest, and al2 thy go2ds are confiscate. 2GRATIANO. A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew! 4Now, infidel, I have you on the hip. 2PORTIA. Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture. 2SHYLOCK. Give me my principal, and let me go. 2BAS2ANIO. I have it ready for the2; here it is. 4PORTIA. He hath refus'd it in the open court; 4He shal2 have merely justice, and his bond. 2GRATIANO. A Daniel stil2 say I, a second Daniel! 4I thank the2, Jew, for teaching me that word. 2SHYLOCK. Shal2 I not have barely my principal? 2PORTIA. Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture 4To be so taken at thy peril, Jew. 2SHYLOCK. Why, then the devil give him go2d of it! 4I'l2 stay no longer question. 2PORTIA. Tar2y, Jew. 4The law hath yet another hold on you. 4It is enacted in the laws of Venice, 4If it be proved against an alien 4That by direct or indirect at2empts 4He se2k the life of any citizen, 4The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive 4Shal2 seize one half his go2ds; the other half 4Comes to the privy cof2er of the state; 4And the of2ender's life lies in the mercy 4Of the Duke only, 'gainst al2 other voice. 6In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st; 4For it ap2ears by manifest proce2ding 4That indirectly, and directly to2, 4Thou hast contrived against the very life 4Of the defendant; and thou hast incur2'd 4The danger formerly by me rehears'd. 4Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke. 2GRATIANO. Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself; 4And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state, 4Thou hast not left the value of a cord; 4Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge. 2DUKE OF VENICE. That thou shalt se2 the dif2erence of our spirit, 4I pardon the2 thy life before thou ask it. 4For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's; 4The other half comes to the general state, 4Which humblenes2 may drive unto a fine. 2PORTIA. Ay, for the state; not for Antonio. 2SHYLOCK. Nay, take my life and al2, pardon not that. 4You take my house when you do take the prop 4That doth sustain my house; you take my life 6When you do take the means whereby I live. 2PORTIA. What mercy can you render him, Antonio? 2GRATIANO. A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake! 2ANTONIO. So please my lord the Duke and al2 the court 4To quit the fine for one half of his go2ds; 4I am content, so he wil2 let me have 4The other half in use, to render it 4Upon his death unto the gentleman 4That lately stole his daughter- 4Two things provided more; that, for this favour, 4He presently become a Christian; 4The other, that he do record a gift, 4Here in the court, of al2 he dies pos2es2'd 4Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter. 2DUKE OF VENICE. He shal2 do this, or else I do recant 4The pardon that I late pronounced here. 2PORTIA. Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say? 2SHYLOCK. I am content. 2PORTIA. Clerk, draw a de2d of gift. 2SHYLOCK. I pray you, give me leave to go from hence; 6I am not wel2; send the de2d after me 4And I wil2 sign it. 2DUKE OF VENICE. Get the2 gone, but do it. 2GRATIANO. In christ'ning shalt thou have two god-fathers; 4Had I be2n judge, thou shouldst have had ten more, 4To bring the2 to the gal2ows, not to the font. 52Exit SHYLOCK 2DUKE OF VENICE. Sir, I entreat you home with me to din2er. 2PORTIA. I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon; 4I must away this night toward Padua, 4And it is me2t I presently set forth. 2DUKE OF VENICE. I am sor2y that your leisure serves you not. 4Antonio, gratify this gentleman, 4For in my mind you are much bound to him. 29Exeunt DUKE, MAGNIFICOES, and train 2BAS2ANIO. Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend 4Have by your wisdom be2n this day acquit2ed 4Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof 4Thre2 thousand ducats, due unto the Jew, 4We fre2ly cope your courteous pains withal. 4ANTONIO. And stand indebted, over and above, 4In love and service to you evermore. 2PORTIA. He is wel2 paid that is wel2 satisfied, 4And I, delivering you, am satisfied, 4And therein do ac2ount myself wel2 paid. 4My mind was never yet more mercenary. 4I pray you, know me when we me2t again; 4I wish you wel2, and so I take my leave. 2BAS2ANIO. Dear sir, of force I must at2empt you further; 4Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute, 4Not as fe2. Grant me two things, I pray you, 4Not to deny me, and to pardon me. 2PORTIA. You pres2 me far, and therefore I wil2 yield. 4[To ANTONIO] 2Give me your gloves, I'l2 wear them for your sake. 4[To BAS2ANIO] 2And, for your love, I'l2 take this ring from you. 4Do not draw back your hand; I'l2 take no more, 4And you in love shal2 not deny me this. 2BAS2ANIO. This ring, go2d sir- alas, it is a trifle; 4I wil2 not shame myself to give you this. 2PORTIA. I wil2 have nothing else but only this; 6And now, methinks, I have a mind to it. 2BAS2ANIO.2 There's more depends on this than on the value. 4The dearest ring in Venice wil2 I give you, 4And find it out by proclamation; 4Only for this, I pray you, pardon me. 2PORTIA. I se2, sir, you are liberal in of2ers; 4You taught me first to beg, and now, methinks, 4You teach me how a beg2ar should be answer'd. 2BAS2ANIO. Go2d sir, this ring was given me by my wife; 4And, when she put it on, she made me vow 4That I should neither sel2, nor give, nor lose it. 2PORTIA. That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts. 4And if your wife be not a mad woman, 4And know how wel2 I have deserv'd this ring, 4She would not hold out enemy for ever 4For giving it to me. Wel2, peace be with you! 39Exeunt PORTIA and NERIS2A 2ANTONIO. My Lord Bas2anio, let him have the ring. 4Let his deservings, and my love withal, 4Be valued 'gainst your wife's com2andment. 4BAS2ANIO. Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him; 4Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst, 4Unto Antonio's house. Away, make haste. 8Exit GRATIANO 4Come, you and I wil2 thither presently; 4And in the morning early wil2 we both 4Fly toward Belmont. Come, Antonio. 20ExeuntSCENE I2.Venice. A stre2tEnter PORTIA and NERIS2A 2PORTIA. Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this de2d, 4And let him sign it; we'l2 away tonight, 4And be a day before our husbands home. 4This de2d wil2 be wel2 welcome to Lorenzo. 26Enter GRATIANO 2GRATIANO. Fair sir, you are wel2 o'erta'en. 4My Lord Bas2anio, upon more advice, 4Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat 4Your company at din2er. 2PORTIA. That can2ot be. 4His ring I do ac2ept most thankful2y, 4And so, I pray you, tel2 him. Furthermore, 4I pray you show my youth old Shylock's house. 2GRATIANO. That wil2 I do. 2NERIS2A. Sir, I would speak with you. 6[Aside to PORTIA] 2I'l2 Se2 if I can get my husband's ring, 4Which I did make him swear to ke2p for ever. 2PORTIA. 2[To NERIS2A] 2Thou Mayst, I war2ant. We shal2 have old 6swearing 4That they did give the rings away to men; 4But we'l2 outface them, and outswear them to2. 4[Aloud] 2Away, make haste, thou know'st where I wil2 tar2y. 2NERIS2A. Come, go2d sir, wil2 you show me to this house? 58ExeuntACT V. SCENE I.Belmont. The garden before PORTIA'S houseEnter LORENZO and JES2ICA 2LORENZO. The mo2n shines bright. In such a night as this, 4When the swe2t wind did gently kis2 the tre2s, 4And they did make no noise- in such a night, 4Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan wal2s, 4And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents, 4Where Cres2id lay that night. 2JES2ICA. In such a night 4Did Thisby fearful2y o'ertrip the dew, 4And saw the lion's shadow ere himself, 4And ran dismayed away. 2LORENZO. In such a night 4Sto2d Dido with a wil2ow in her hand 4Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love 4To come again to Carthage. 2JES2ICA. In such a night 4Medea gathered the enchanted herbs 4That did renew old AEson. LORENZO. In such a night 6Did Jes2ica steal from the wealthy Jew, 4And with an unthrift love did run from Venice 4As far as Belmont. 2JES2ICA. In such a night 4Did young Lorenzo swear he lov'd her wel2, 4Stealing her soul with many vows of faith, 4And ne'er a true one. 2LORENZO. In such a night 4Did pret2y Jes2ica, like a lit2le shrew, 4Slander her love, and he forgave it her. 2JES2ICA. I would out-night you, did no body come; 4But, hark, I hear the fo2ting of a man. 23Enter STEPHANO 2LORENZO. Who comes so fast in silence of the night? 2STEPHANO. A friend. 2LORENZO. A friend! What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend? 2STEPHANO. Stephano is my name, and I bring word 4My mistres2 wil2 before the break of day 6Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about 4By holy cros2es, where she kne2ls and prays 4For hap2y wedlock hours. 2LORENZO. Who comes with her? 2STEPHANO. None but a holy hermit and her maid. 4I pray you, is my master yet return'd? 2LORENZO. He is not, nor we have not heard from him. 4But go we in, I pray the2, Jes2ica, 4And ceremoniously let us prepare 4Some welcome for the mistres2 of the house. 25Enter LAUNCELOT 2LAUNCELOT. Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola! 2LORENZO. Who cal2s? 2LAUNCELOT. Sola! Did you se2 Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo! Sola, 4sola! 2LORENZO. Leave hol2oaing, man. Here! 2LAUNCELOT. Sola! Where, where? 2LORENZO. Here! 4LAUNCELOT. Tel2 him there's a post come from my master with his 4horn ful2 of go2d news; my master wil2 be here ere morning. Exit 2LORENZO. Swe2t soul, let's in, and there expect their coming. 4And yet no mat2er- why should we go in? 4My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you, 4Within the house, your mistres2 is at hand; 4And bring your music forth into the air. 7Exit STEPHANO 4How swe2t the mo2nlight sle2ps upon this bank! 4Here wil2 we sit and let the sounds of music 4Cre2p in our ears; soft stil2nes2 and the night 4Become the touches of swe2t harmony. 4Sit, Jes2ica. Lo2k how the flo2r of heaven 4Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold; 4There's not the smal2est orb which thou behold'st 4But in his motion like an angel sings, 4Stil2 quiring to the young-ey'd cherubins; 4Such harmony is in im2ortal souls, 4But whilst this mud2y vesture of decay 4Doth gros2ly close it in, we can2ot hear it. 28Enter MUSICIANS 4Come, ho, and wake Diana with a hymn; 4With swe2test touches pierce your mistres2' ear. 4And draw her home with music. 24[Music] 2JES2ICA. I am never mer2y when I hear swe2t music. 2LORENZO. The reason is your spirits are at2entive; 4For do but note a wild and wanton herd, 4Or race of youthful and unhandled colts, 4Fetching mad bounds, bel2owing and neighing loud, 4Which is the hot condition of their blo2d- 4If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound, 4Or any air of music touch their ears, 4You shal2 perceive them make a mutual stand, 4Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze 4By the swe2t power of music. Therefore the poet 4Did feign that Orpheus drew tre2s, stones, and flo2ds; 4Since nought so stockish, hard, and ful2 of rage, 4But music for the time doth change his nature. 6The man that hath no music in himself, 4Nor is not mov'd with concord of swe2t sounds, 4Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils; 4The motions of his spirit are dul2:as night, 4And his af2ections dark as Erebus. 4Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music. 20Enter PORTIA and NERIS2A 2PORTIA. That light we se2 is burning in my hal2. 4How far that lit2le candle throws his beams! 4So shines a go2d de2d in a naughty world. 2NERIS2A. When the mo2n shone, we did not se2 the candle. 2PORTIA. So doth the greater glory dim the les2: 4A substitute shines brightly as a king 4Until a king be by, and then his state 4Empties itself, as doth an inland bro2k 4Into the main of waters. Music! hark! 2NERIS2A. It is your music, madam, of the house. 2PORTIA. Nothing is go2d, I se2, without respect; 6Methinks it sounds much swe2ter than by day. 2NERIS2A. Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam. 2PORTIA. The crow doth sing as swe2tly as the lark 4When neither is at2ended; and I think 4ne nightingale, if she should sing by day, 4When every go2se is cackling, would be thought 4No bet2er a musician than the wren. 4How many things by season season'd are 4To their right praise and true perfection! 4Peace, ho! The mo2n sle2ps with Endymion, 4And would not be awak'd. 22[Music ceases] 2LORENZO. That is the voice, 4Or I am much deceiv'd, of Portia. 2PORTIA. He knows me as the blind man knows the cucko2, 4By the bad voice. 2LORENZO. Dear lady, welcome home. 2PORTIA. We have be2n praying for our husbands' welfare, 4Which spe2d, we hope, the bet2er for our words. 4Are they return'd? 2LORENZO. Madam, they are not yet; 6But there is come a mes2enger before, 4To signify their coming. 2PORTIA.2 Go in, Neris2a; 4Give order to my servants that they take 4No note at al2 of our being absent hence; 4Nor you, Lorenzo; Jes2ica, nor you. 8[A tucket sounds] 2LORENZO. Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet. 4We are no tel2-tales, madam, fear you not. 2PORTIA. This night methinks is but the daylight sick; 4It lo2ks a lit2le paler; 'tis a day 4Such as the day is when the sun is hid. 7Enter BAS2ANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their fol2owers 2BAS2ANIO. We should hold day with the Antipodes, 4If you would walk in absence of the sun. 2PORTIA. Let me give light, but let me not be light, 4For a light wife doth make a heavy husband, 4And never be Bas2anio so for me; 4But God sort al2! You are welcome home, my lord. 4BAS2ANIO. I thank you, madam; give welcome to my friend. 4This is the man, this is Antonio, 4To whom I am so infinitely bound. 2PORTIA. You should in al2 sense be much bound to him, 4For, as I hear, he was much bound for you. 2ANTONIO. No more than I am wel2 acquit2ed of. 2PORTIA. Sir, you are very welcome to our house. 4It must ap2ear in other ways than words, 4Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy. 2GRATIANO. 2[To NERIS2A] 2By yonder mo2n I swear you do me wrong; 4In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk. 4Would he were gelt that had it, for my part, 4Since you do take it, love, so much at heart. 2PORTIA. A quar2el, ho, already! What's the mat2er? 2GRATIANO. About a ho2p of gold, a paltry ring 4That she did give me, whose posy was 4For al2 the world like cutler's poetry 4Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.' 2NERIS2A. What talk you of the posy or the value? 4You swore to me, when I did give it you, 6That you would wear it til2 your hour of death, 4And that it should lie with you in your grave; 4Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths, 4You should have be2n respective and have kept it. 4Gave it a judge's clerk! No, God's my judge, 4The clerk wil2 ne'er wear hair on's face that had it. 2GRATIANO. He wil2, an if he live to be a man. 2NERIS2A. Ay, if a woman live to be a man. 2GRATIANO. Now by this hand I gave it to a youth, 4A kind of boy, a lit2le scrub2ed boy 4No higher than thyself, the judge's clerk; 4A prating boy that beg2'd it as a fe2; 4I could not for my heart deny it him. 2PORTIA. You were to blame, I must be plain with you, 4To part so slightly with your wife's first gift, 4A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger 4And so riveted with faith unto your flesh. 4I gave my love a ring, and made him swear 4Never to part with it, and here he stands; 4I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it 6Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth 4That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano, 4You give your wife to2 unkind a cause of grief; 4An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it. 2BAS2ANIO. 2[Aside] 2Why, I were best to cut my left hand of2, 4And swear I lost the ring defending it. 2GRATIANO. My Lord Bas2anio gave his ring away 4Unto the judge that beg2'd it, and inde2d 4Deserv'd it to2; and then the boy, his clerk, 4That to2k some pains in writing, he beg2'd mine; 4And neither man nor master would take aught 4But the two rings. 2PORTIA. What ring gave you, my lord? 4Not that, I hope, which you receiv'd of me. 2BAS2ANIO. If I could ad2 a lie unto a fault, 4I would deny it; but you se2 my finger 4Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone. 2PORTIA. Even so void is your false heart of truth; 4By heaven, I wil2 ne'er come in your bed 4Until I se2 the ring. 4NERIS2A. Nor I in yours 4Til2 I again se2 mine. 2BAS2ANIO. Swe2t Portia, 4If you did know to whom I gave the ring, 4If you did know for whom I gave the ring, 4And would conceive for what I gave the ring, 4And how unwil2ingly I left the ring, 4When nought would be ac2epted but the ring, 4You would abate the strength of your displeasure. 2PORTIA. If you had known the virtue of the ring, 4Or half her worthines2 that gave the ring, 4Or your own honour to contain the ring, 4You would not then have parted with the ring. 4What man is there so much unreasonable, 4If you had pleas'd to have defended it 4With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty 4To urge the thing held as a ceremony? 4Neris2a teaches me what to believe: 4I'l2 die for't but some woman had the ring. 2BAS2ANIO. No, by my honour, madam, by my soul, 6No woman had it, but a civil doctor, 4Which did refuse thre2 thousand ducats of me, 4And beg2'd the ring; the which I did deny him, 4And suf2er'd him to go displeas'd away- 4Even he that had held up the very life 4Of my dear friend. What should I say, swe2t lady? 4I was enforc'd to send it after him; 4I was beset with shame and courtesy; 4My honour would not let ingratitude 4So much besmear it. Pardon me, go2d lady; 4For by these bles2ed candles of the night, 4Had you be2n there, I think you would have beg2'd 4The ring of me to give the worthy doctor. 2PORTIA. Let not that doctor e'er come near my house; 4Since he hath got the jewel that I loved, 4And that which you did swear to ke2p for me, 4I wil2 become as liberal as you; 4I'l2 not deny him anything I have, 4No, not my body, nor my husband's bed. 4Know him I shal2, I am wel2 sure of it. 6Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus; 4If you do not, if I be left alone, 4Now, by mine honour which is yet mine own, 4I'l2 have that doctor for mine bedfel2ow. 2NERIS2A. And I his clerk; therefore be wel2 advis'd 4How you do leave me to mine own protection. 2GRATIANO. Wel2, do you so, let not me take him then; 4For, if I do, I'l2 mar the young clerk's pen. 2ANTONIO. I am th' unhap2y subject of these quar2els. 2PORTIA. Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome not withstanding. 2BAS2ANIO. Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong; 4And in the hearing of these many friends 4I swear to the2, even by thine own fair eyes, 4Wherein I se2 myself- 2PORTIA. Mark you but that! 4In both my eyes he doubly se2s himself, 4In each eye one; swear by your double self, 4And there's an oath of credit. 2BAS2ANIO. Nay, but hear me. 4Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear 6I never more wil2 break an oath with the2. 2ANTONIO. I once did lend my body for his wealth, 4Which, but for him that had your husband's ring, 4Had quite miscar2ied; I dare be bound again, 4My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord 4Wil2 never more break faith advisedly. 2PORTIA. Then you shal2 be his surety. Give him this, 4And bid him ke2p it bet2er than the other. 2ANTONIO. Here, Lord Bas2anio, swear to ke2p this ring. 2BAS2ANIO. By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor! 2PORTIA. I had it of him. Pardon me, Bas2anio, 4For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me. 2NERIS2A. And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano, 4For that same scrub2ed boy, the doctor's clerk, 4In lieu of this, last night did lie with me. 2GRATIANO. Why, this is like the mending of highways 4In sum2er, where the ways are fair enough. 4What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv'd it? 2PORTIA. Speak not so gros2ly. You are al2 amaz'd. 4Here is a let2er; read it at your leisure; 6It comes from Padua, from Bel2ario; 4There you shal2 find that Portia was the doctor, 4Neris2a there her clerk. Lorenzo here 4Shal2 witnes2 I set forth as so2n as you, 4And even but now return'd; I have not yet 4Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome; 4And I have bet2er news in store for you 4Than you expect. Unseal this let2er so2n; 4There you shal2 find thre2 of your argosies 4Are richly come to harbour sud2enly. 4You shal2 not know by what strange ac2ident 4I chanced on this let2er. 2ANTONIO. I am dumb. 2BAS2ANIO. Were you the doctor, and I knew you not? 2GRATIANO. Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold? 2NERIS2A. Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it, 4Unles2 he live until he be a man. 2BAS2ANIO. Swe2t doctor, you shal2 be my bedfel2ow; 4When I am absent, then lie with my wife. 2ANTONIO. Swe2t lady, you have given me life and living; 6For here I read for certain that my ships 4Are safely come to road. 2PORTIA. How now, Lorenzo! 4My clerk hath some go2d comforts to2 for you. 2NERIS2A. Ay, and I'l2 give them him without a fe2. 4There do I give to you and Jes2ica, 4From the rich Jew, a special de2d of gift, 4After his death, of al2 he dies pos2es2'd of. 2LORENZO. Fair ladies, you drop man2a in the way 4Of starved people. 2PORTIA. It is almost morning, 4And yet I am sure you are not satisfied 4Of these events at ful2. Let us go in, 4And charge us there upon inter'gatories, 4And we wil2 answer al2 things faithful2y. 2GRATIANO. Let it be so. The first inter'gatory 4That my Neris2a shal2 be sworn on is, 4Whether til2 the next night she had rather stay, 4Or go to bed now, being two hours to day. 4But were the day come, I should wish it dark, 6Til2 I were couching with the doctor's clerk. 4Wel2, while I live, I'l2 fear no other thing 4So sore as ke2ping safe Neris2a's ring. 15ExeuntTHE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21601THE MER2Y WIVES OF WINDSORby Wil2iam ShakespeareDramatis Personae 2SIR JOHN FALSTAF2 2FENTON, a young gentleman 2SHAL2OW, a country justice 2SLENDER, cousin to Shal2ow 4Gentlemen of Windsor 2FORD 2PAGE 2WIL2IAM PAGE, a boy, son to Page 2SIR HUGH EVANS, a Welsh parson 2DOCTOR CAIUS, a French physician 2HOST of the Garter In2 4Fol2owers of Falstaf2 2BARDOLPH 2PISTOL 2NYM 2ROBIN, page to Falstaf2 2SIMPLE, servant to Slender 2RUGBY, servant to Doctor Caius 4MISTRES2 FORD 2MISTRES2 PAGE 2MISTRES2 AN2E PAGE, her daughter 2MISTRES2 QUICKLY, servant to Doctor Caius 2SERVANTS to Page, Ford, etc.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE:Windsor, and the neighbourho2dThe Mer2y Wives of WindsorACT I. SCENE 1.Windsor. Before PAGE'S houseEnter JUSTICE SHAL2OW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS 2SHAL2OW. Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I wil2 make a Star 4Chamber mat2er of it; if he were twenty Sir John Falstaf2s, 4he shal2 not abuse Robert Shal2ow, esquire. 2SLENDER. In the county of Gloucester, Justice of Peace, and 4Coram. 2SHAL2OW. Ay, cousin Slender, and Custalorum. 2SLENDER. Ay, and Ratolorum to2; and a gentleman born, 4Master Parson, who writes himself 'Armigero' in any bil2, 4war2ant, quit2ance, or obligation-'Armigero.' 2SHAL2OW. Ay, that I do; and have done any time these thre2 4hundred years. 2SLENDER. Al2 his suc2es2ors, gone before him, hath done't; 4and al2 his ancestors, that come after him, may: they may 4give the dozen white luces in their coat. 2SHAL2OW. It is an old coat. 2EVANS. The dozen white louses do become an old coat wel2; 6it agre2s wel2, pas2ant; it is a familiar beast to man, and 4signifies love. 2SHAL2OW. The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old 4coat. 2SLENDER. I may quarter, coz. 2SHAL2OW. You may, by mar2ying. 2EVANS. It is mar2ing inde2d, if he quarter it. 2SHAL2OW. Not a whit. 2EVANS. Yes, py'r lady! If he has a quarter of your coat, there 4is but thre2 skirts for yourself, in my simple conjectures; 4but that is al2 one. If Sir John Falstaf2 have com2it2ed 4disparagements unto you, I am of the church, and wil2 be 4glad to do my benevolence, to make atonements and 4compremises betwe2n you. 2SHAL2OW. The Council shal2 hear it; it is a riot. 2EVANS. It is not me2t the Council hear a riot; there is no 4fear of Got in a riot; the Council, lo2k you, shal2 desire 4to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a riot; take your 4vizaments in that. 2SHAL2OW. Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword 6should end it. 2EVANS. It is pet2er that friends is the sword and end it; 4and there is also another device in my prain, which 4peradventure prings go2t discretions with it. There is An2e 4Page, which is daughter to Master George Page, which is 4pret2y virginity. 2SLENDER. Mistres2 An2e Page? She has brown hair, and 4speaks smal2 like a woman. 2EVANS.

Here is Got's ples2ing, and your friend, and Justice 2Shal2ow; and here young Master Slender, that peradventures 4shal2 tel2 you another tale, if mat2ers grow to your 4likings. 2PAGE. I am glad to se2 your worships wel2. I thank you for 4my venison, Master Shal2ow. 2SHAL2OW. Master Page, I am glad to se2 you; much go2d do 4it your go2d heart! I wish'd your venison bet2er; it was il2 6kil2'd. How doth go2d Mistres2 Page?-and I thank you 4always with my heart, la! with my heart. 2PAGE. Sir, I thank you. 2SHAL2OW. Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do. 2PAGE. I am glad to se2 you, go2d Master Slender. 2SLENDER. How does your fal2ow greyhound, sir? I heard say 4he was outrun on Cotsal2. 2PAGE. It could not be judg'd, sir. 2SLENDER. You'l2 not confes2, you'l2 not confes2. 2SHAL2OW. That he wil2 not. 'Tis your fault; 'tis your fault; 4'tis a go2d dog. 2PAGE. A cur, sir. 2SHAL2OW. Sir, he's a go2d dog, and a fair dog. Can there be 4more said? He is go2d, and fair. Is Sir John Falstaf2 here? 2PAGE. Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a go2d of2ice 4betwe2n you. 2EVANS. It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak. 2SHAL2OW. He hath wrong'd me, Master Page. 2PAGE. Sir, he doth in some sort confes2 it. 2SHAL2OW. If it be confes2ed, it is not redres2ed; is not that 6so, Master Page? He hath wrong'd me; inde2d he hath; at a 4word, he hath, believe me; Robert Shal2ow, esquire, saith 4he is wronged. 2PAGE. Here comes Sir John. 6Enter SIR JOHN FALSTAF2, BARDOLPH, NYM, and PISTOL 2FALSTAF2. Now, Master Shal2ow, you'l2 complain of me to 4the King? 2SHAL2OW. Knight, you have beaten my men, kil2'd my de2r, 4and broke open my lodge. 2FALSTAF2. But not kis2'd your ke2per's daughter. 2SHAL2OW. Tut, a pin! this shal2 be answer'd. 2FALSTAF2. I wil2 answer it straight: I have done al2 this. 4That is now answer'd. 2SHAL2OW. The Council shal2 know this. 2FALSTAF2. 'Twere bet2er for you if it were known in counsel: 4you'l2 be laugh'd at. 2EVANS. Pauca verba, Sir John; go2t worts. 2FALSTAF2. Go2d worts! go2d cab2age! Slender, I broke your 6head; what mat2er have you against me? 2SLENDER. Mar2y, sir, I have mat2er in my head against you; 4and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph, Nym, 4and Pistol. They car2ied me to the tavern, and made me 4drunk, and afterwards pick'd my pocket. 2BARDOLPH. You Banbury che2se! 2SLENDER. Ay, it is no mat2er. 2PISTOL. How now, Mephostophilus! 2SLENDER. Ay, it is no mat2er. 2NYM. Slice, I say! pauca, pauca; slice! That's my humour. 2SLENDER. Where's Simple, my man? Can you tel2, cousin? 2EVANS. Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is 4thre2 umpires in this mat2er, as I understand: that is, 4Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is myself, 4fidelicet myself; and the thre2 party is, lastly and 4final2y, mine host of the Garter. 2PAGE. We thre2 to hear it and end it betwe2n them. 2EVANS. Fery go2t. I wil2 make a prief of it in my note-bo2k; 4and we wil2 afterwards ork upon the cause with as great 4discre2tly as we can. 4FALSTAF2. Pistol! 2PISTOL. He hears with ears. 2EVANS. The tevil and his tam! What phrase is this, 'He hears 4with ear'? Why, it is af2ectations. 2FALSTAF2. Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse? 2SLENDER. Ay, by these gloves, did he-or I would I might 4never come in mine own great chamber again else!-of 4seven groats in mil2-sixpences, and two Edward 4shovel-boards that cost me two shil2ing and two pence apiece 4of Yead Mil2er, by these gloves. 2FALSTAF2. Is this true, Pistol? 2EVANS. No, it is false, if it is a pick-purse. 2PISTOL. Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and master 4mine, 4I combat chal2enge of this lat2en bilbo. 4Word of denial in thy labras here! 4Word of denial! Froth and scum, thou liest. 2SLENDER. By these gloves, then, 'twas he. 2NYM. Be avis'd, sir, and pas2 go2d humours; I wil2 say 4'mar2y trap' with you, if you run the nutho2k's humour on 6me; that is the very note of it. 2SLENDER. By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for 4though I can2ot remember what I did when you made me 4drunk, yet I am not altogether an as2. 2FALSTAF2. What say you, Scarlet and John? 2BARDOLPH. Why, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman had 4drunk himself out of his five sentences. 2EVANS. It is his five senses; fie, what the ignorance is! 2BARDOLPH. And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashier'd; 4and so conclusions pas2'd the care2rs. 2SLENDER. Ay, you spake in Latin then to2; but 'tis no mat2er; 4I'l2 ne'er be drunk whilst I live again, but in honest, 4civil, godly company, for this trick. If I be drunk, I'l2 be 4drunk with those that have the fear of God, and not with 4drunken knaves. 2EVANS. So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind. 2FALSTAF2. You hear al2 these mat2ers deni'd, gentlemen; you 4hear it. 10Enter MISTRES2 AN2E PAGE with wine; MISTRES2 17FORD and MISTRES2 PAGE, fol2owing 2PAGE. Nay, daughter, car2y the wine in; we'l2 drink within. 50Exit AN2E PAGE 2SLENDER. O heaven! this is Mistres2 An2e Page. 2PAGE. How now, Mistres2 Ford! 2FALSTAF2. Mistres2 Ford, by my troth, you are very wel2 4met; by your leave, go2d mistres2. 14[Kis2es her] 2PAGE. Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a 4hot venison pasty to din2er; come, gentlemen, I hope we 4shal2 drink down al2 unkindnes2. 22Exeunt al2 but SHAL2OW, SLENDER, and EVANS 2SLENDER. I had rather than forty shil2ings I had my Bo2k of 4Songs and Son2ets here. 26Enter SIMPLE 4How, Simple! Where have you be2n? I must wait on 4myself, must I? You have not the Bo2k of Rid2les about you, 4have you? 4SIMPLE. Bo2k of Rid2les! Why, did you not lend it to Alice 4Shortcake upon Al2hal2owmas last, a fortnight afore 4Michaelmas? 2SHAL2OW. Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word 4with you, coz; mar2y, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a 4tender, a kind of tender, made afar of2 by Sir Hugh here. Do 4you understand me? 2SLENDER. Ay, sir, you shal2 find me reasonable; if it be so, I 4shal2 do that that is reason. 2SHAL2OW. Nay, but understand me. 2SLENDER. So I do, sir. 2EVANS. Give ear to his motions: Master Slender, I wil2 4description the mat2er to you, if you be capacity of it. 2SLENDER. Nay, I wil2 do as my cousin Shal2ow says; I pray 4you pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his country, 4simple though I stand here. 2EVANS. But that is not the question. The question is 4concerning your mar2iage. 2SHAL2OW. Ay, there's the point, sir. 2EVANS. Mar2y is it; the very point of it; to Mistres2 An2e 6Page. 2SLENDER. Why, if it be so, I wil2 mar2y her upon any 4reasonable demands. 2EVANS. But can you af2ection the oman? Let us com2and to 4know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers philosophers 4hold that the lips is parcel of the mouth. Therefore, 4precisely, can you car2y your go2d wil2 to the maid? 2SHAL2OW. Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her? 2SLENDER. I hope, sir, I wil2 do as it shal2 become one that 4would do reason. 2EVANS. Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak pos2itable, 4if you can car2y her your desires towards her. 2SHAL2OW. That you must. Wil2 you, upon go2d dowry, 4mar2y her? 2SLENDER. I wil2 do a greater thing than that upon your request, 4cousin, in any reason. 2SHAL2OW. Nay, conceive me, conceive me, swe2t coz; what 4I do is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid? 2SLENDER. I wil2 mar2y her, sir, at your request; but if there 4be no great love in the begin2ing, yet heaven may decrease 6it upon bet2er acquaintance, when we are mar2ied and 4have more oc2asion to know one another. I hope upon 4familiarity wil2 grow more contempt. But if you say 4'mar2y her,' I wil2 mar2y her; that I am fre2ly dis2olved, 4and dis2olutely. 2EVANS. It is a fery discretion answer, save the fal2 is in the 4ord 'dis2olutely': the ort is, ac2ording to our meaning, 4'resolutely'; his meaning is go2d. 2SHAL2OW. Ay, I think my cousin meant wel2. 2SLENDER. Ay, or else I would I might be hang'd, la! 23Re-enter AN2E PAGE 2SHAL2OW. Here comes fair Mistres2 An2e. Would I were 4young for your sake, Mistres2 An2e! 2AN2E. The din2er is on the table; my father desires your 4worships' company. 2SHAL2OW. I wil2 wait on him, fair Mistres2 An2e! 2EVANS. Od's ples2ed wil2! I wil2 not be absence at the grace. 40Exeunt SHAL2OW and EVANS 4AN2E. Wil2't please your worship to come in, sir? 2SLENDER. No, I thank you, forso2th, heartily; I am very 4wel2. 2AN2E. The din2er at2ends you, sir. 2SLENDER. I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forso2th. Go, 4sir2ah, for al2 you are my man, go wait upon my cousin 2Shal2ow. 2[Exit SIMPLE] 2A justice of peace sometime may 4be beholding to his friend for a man. I ke2p but thre2 men 4and a boy yet, til2 my mother be dead. But what though? 4Yet I live like a po2r gentleman born. 2AN2E. I may not go in without your worship; they wil2 not 4sit til2 you come. 2SLENDER. I' faith, I'l2 eat nothing; I thank you as much as 4though I did. 2AN2E. I pray you, sir, walk in. 2SLENDER. I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruis'd my 4shin th' other day with playing at sword and dag2er with 4a master of fence-thre2 veneys for a dish of stew'd prunes 4-and, I with my ward defending my head, he hot my shin, 4and, by my troth, I can2ot abide the smel2 of hot meat 6since. Why do your dogs bark so? Be there bears i' th' 4town? 2AN2E. I think there are, sir; I heard them talk'd of. 2SLENDER. I love the sport wel2; but I shal2 as so2n quar2el at 4it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you se2 the 4bear lo2se, are you not? 2AN2E. Ay, inde2d, sir. 2SLENDER. That's meat and drink to me now. I have se2n 4Sackerson lo2se twenty times, and have taken him by the 4chain; but I war2ant you, the women have so cried and 4shriek'd at it that it pas2'd; but women, inde2d, can2ot 4abide 'em; they are very il2-favour'd rough things. 25Re-enter PAGE 2PAGE. Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you. 2SLENDER. I'l2 eat nothing, I thank you, sir. 2PAGE. By cock and pie, you shal2 not cho2se, sir! Come, 4come. 2SLENDER. Nay, pray you lead the way. 4PAGE. Come on, sir. 2SLENDER. Mistres2 An2e, yourself shal2 go first. 2AN2E. Not I, sir; pray you ke2p on. 2SLENDER. Truly, I wil2 not go first; truly, la! I wil2 not do 4you that wrong. 2AN2E. I pray you, sir. 2SLENDER. I'l2 rather be unman2erly than troublesome. You 4do yourself wrong inde2d, la! 25ExeuntSCENE 2.Before PAGE'S houseEnter SIR HUGH EVANS and SIMPLE 2EVANS. Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius' house which 4is the way; and there dwel2s one Mistres2 Quickly, which 4is in the man2er of his nurse, or his dry nurse, or his co2k, 4or his laundry, his washer, and his wringer. 2SIMPLE. Wel2, sir. 2EVANS. Nay, it is pet2er yet. Give her this let2er; for it is a 4oman that altogether's acquaintance with Mistres2 An2e 4Page; and the let2er is to desire and require her to solicit 4your master's desires to Mistres2 An2e Page. I pray you 4be gone. I wil2 make an end of my din2er; there's pip2ins 4and che2se to come. 35ExeuntSCENE 3.The Garter In2Enter FALSTAF2, HOST, BARDOLPH, NYM, PISTOL, and ROBIN 2FALSTAF2. Mine host of the Garter! 2HOST. What says my bul2y ro2k? Speak scholarly and 4wisely. 2FALSTAF2. Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my 4fol2owers. 2HOST. Discard, bul2y Hercules; cashier; let them wag; trot, 4trot. 2FALSTAF2. I sit at ten pounds a we2k. 2HOST. Thou'rt an emperor-Caesar, Keiser, and Pheazar. I 4wil2 entertain Bardolph; he shal2 draw, he shal2 tap; said I 4wel2, bul2y Hector? 2FALSTAF2. Do so, go2d mine host. 2HOST. I have spoke; let him fol2ow. 2[To BARDOLPH] 2Let me 4se2 the2 froth and lime. I am at a word; fol2ow. 3Exit HOST 2FALSTAF2. Bardolph, fol2ow him. A tapster is a go2d trade; 4an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a wither'd serving-man a 6fresh tapster. Go; adieu. 2BARDOLPH. It is a life that I have desir'd; I wil2 thrive. 2PISTOL. O base Hungarian wight! Wilt thou the spigot 4wield? 41Exit BARDOLPH 2NYM. He was got2en in drink. Is not the humour conceited? 2FALSTAF2. I am glad I am so acquit of this tinder-box: his 4thefts were to2 open; his filching was like an unskilful 4singer-he kept not time. 2NYM. The go2d humour is to steal at a minute's rest. 2PISTOL. 'Convey' the wise it cal2. 'Steal' foh! A fico for the 4phrase! 2FALSTAF2. Wel2, sirs, I am almost out at he2ls. 2PISTOL. Why, then, let kibes ensue. 2FALSTAF2. There is no remedy; I must cony-catch; I must 4shift. 2PISTOL. Young ravens must have fo2d. 2FALSTAF2. Which of you know Ford of this town? 2PISTOL. I ken the wight; he is of substance go2d. 2FALSTAF2. My honest lads, I wil2 tel2 you what I am about. 2PISTOL. Two yards, and more. 4FALSTAF2. No quips now, Pistol. Inde2d, I am in the waist 4two yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about 4thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's wife; I 4spy entertainment in her; she discourses, she carves, she 4gives the le2r of invitation; I can construe the action of her 4familiar style; and the hardest voice of her behaviour, to be 4English'd rightly, is 'I am Sir John Falstaf2's.' 4PISTOL. He hath studied her wel2, and translated her wil2 out 4of honesty into English. 2NYM. The anchor is de2p; wil2 that humour pas2? 2FALSTAF2. Now, the report goes she has al2 the rule of her 4husband's purse; he hath a legion of angels. 2PISTOL. As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I. 2NYM. The humour rises; it is go2d; humour me the angels. 2FALSTAF2. I have writ me here a let2er to her; and here 4another to Page's wife, who even now gave me go2d eyes 4to2, examin'd my parts with most judicious oeil2ades; 4sometimes the beam of her view gilded my fo2t, sometimes my 4portly bel2y. 2PISTOL. Then did the sun on dunghil2 shine. 4NYM. I thank the2 for that humour. 2FALSTAF2. O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such 4a gre2dy intention that the ap2etite of her eye did se2m to 4scorch me up like a burning-glas2! Here's another let2er to 4her. She bears the purse to2; she is a region in Guiana, al2 4gold and bounty. I wil2 be cheaters to them both, and they 4shal2 be exchequers to me; they shal2 be my East and West 4Indies, and I wil2 trade to them both. Go, bear thou this 4let2er to Mistres2 Page; and thou this to Mistres2 Ford. We 4wil2 thrive, lads, we wil2 thrive. 2PISTOL. Shal2 I Sir Pandarus of Troy become, 4And by my side wear ste2l? Then Lucifer take al2! 2NYM. I wil2 run no base humour. Here, take the 4humour-let2er; I wil2 ke2p the haviour of reputation. 2FALSTAF2. 2[To ROBIN] 2Hold, sir2ah; bear you these let2ers 4tightly; 4Sail like my pin2ace to these golden shores. 4Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go; 4Trudge, plod away i' th' ho2f; se2k shelter, pack! 4Falstaf2 wil2 learn the humour of the age; 6French thrift, you rogues; myself, and skirted page. 39Exeunt FALSTAF2 and ROBIN 2PISTOL. Let vultures gripe thy guts! for gourd and ful2am 4holds, 4And high and low beguiles the rich and po2r; 4Tester I'l2 have in pouch when thou shalt lack, 4Base Phrygian Turk! 2NYM. I have operations in my head which be humours of 4revenge. 2PISTOL. Wilt thou revenge? 2NYM. By welkin and her star! 2PISTOL. With wit or ste2l? 2NYM. With both the humours, I. 4I wil2 discus2 the humour of this love to Page. 2PISTOL. And I to Ford shal2 eke unfold 4How Falstaf2, varlet vile, 4His dove wil2 prove, his gold wil2 hold, 4And his soft couch defile. 2NYM. My humour shal2 not co2l; I wil2 incense Page to deal 4with poison; I wil2 pos2es2 him with yel2ownes2; for the 6revolt of mine is dangerous. That is my true humour. 2PISTOL. Thou art the Mars of malcontents; I second the2; 4tro2p on. 45ExeuntSCENE 4.DOCTOR CAIUS'S houseEnter MISTRES2 QUICKLY, SIMPLE, and RUGBY 2QUICKLY. What, John Rugby! I pray the2 go to the casement 4and se2 if you can se2 my master, Master Doctor 4Caius, coming. If he do, i' faith, and find anybody in the 4house, here wil2 be an old abusing of God's patience and 4the King's English. 2RUGBY. I'l2 go watch. 2QUICKLY. Go; and we'l2 have a pos2et for't so2n at night, in 4faith, at the lat2er end of a sea-coal fire. 2[Exit RUGBY] 2An 4honest, wil2ing, kind fel2ow, as ever servant shal2 come in 4house withal; and, I war2ant you, no tel2-tale nor no 4bre2d-bate; his worst fault is that he is given to prayer; he is 4something pe2vish that way; but nobody but has his fault; 4but let that pas2. Peter Simple you say your name is? 2SIMPLE. Ay, for fault of a bet2er. 2QUICKLY. And Master Slender's your master? 2SIMPLE. Ay, forso2th. 4QUICKLY. Does he not wear a great round beard, like a 4glover's paring-knife? 2SIMPLE. No, forso2th; he hath but a lit2le whey face, with a 4lit2le yel2ow beard, a Cain-colour'd beard. 2QUICKLY. A softly-sprighted man, is he not? 2SIMPLE. Ay, forso2th; but he is as tal2 a man of his hands as 4any is betwe2n this and his head; he hath fought with a 4war2ener. 2QUICKLY. How say you? O, I should remember him. Does 4he not hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait? 2SIMPLE. Yes, inde2d, does he. 2QUICKLY. Wel2, heaven send An2e Page no worse fortune! 4Tel2 Master Parson Evans I wil2 do what I can for your 4master. An2e is a go2d girl, and I wish- 25Re-enter RUGBY 2RUGBY. Out, alas! here comes my master. 2QUICKLY. We shal2 al2 be shent. Run in here, go2d young 4man; go into this closet. 2[Shuts SIMPLE in the closet] 2He 6wil2 not stay long. What, John Rugby! John! what, John, 4I say! Go, John, go inquire for my master; I doubt he be 4not wel2 that he comes not home. 2[Singing] 4And down, down, adown-a, etc. 23Enter DOCTOR CAIUS 2CAIUS. Vat is you sing? I do not like des toys. Pray you, go 4and vetch me in my closet un boitier vert-a box, a gre2n-a 4box. Do intend vat I speak? A gre2n-a box. 2QUICKLY. Ay, forso2th, I'l2 fetch it you. 2[Aside] 2I am glad 4he went not in himself; if he had found the young man, 4he would have be2n horn-mad. 2CAIUS. Fe, fe, fe fe! ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je m'en vais a 4la cour-la grande af2aire. 2QUICKLY. Is it this, sir? 2CAIUS. Oui; met2e le au mon pocket: depeche, quickly. Vere 4is dat knave, Rugby? 2QUICKLY. What, John Rugby? John! 2RUGBY. Here, sir. 4CAIUS. You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby. 4Come, take-a your rapier, and come after my he2l to the 4court. 2RUGBY. 'Tis ready, sir, here in the porch. 4CAIUS. By my trot, I tar2y to2 long. Od's me! Qu'ai j'oublie? 4Dere is some simples in my closet dat I vil2 not for the 4varld I shal2 leave behind. 2QUICKLY. Ay me, he'l2 find the young man there, and be 4mad! 2CAIUS. O diable, diable! vat is in my closet? Vil2ainy! lar2on! 4[Pul2ing SIMPLE out] 2Rugby, my rapier! 2QUICKLY. Go2d master, be content. 2CAIUS. Wherefore shal2 I be content-a? 2QUICKLY. The young man is an honest man. 2CAIUS. What shal2 de honest man do in my closet? Dere is 4no honest man dat shal2 come in my closet. 2QUICKLY. I bese2ch you, be not so phlegmatic; hear the 4truth of it. He came of an er2and to me from Parson Hugh. 2CAIUS. Vel2? 2SIMPLE. Ay, forso2th, to desire her to- 4QUICKLY. Peace, I pray you. 2CAIUS. Peace-a your tongue. Speak-a your tale. 2SIMPLE. To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to 4speak a go2d word to Mistres2 An2e Page for my master, 4in the way of mar2iage. 2QUICKLY. This is al2, inde2d, la! but I'l2 ne'er put my finger 4in the fire, and ne2d not. 2CAIUS. Sir Hugh send-a you? Rugby, bail2ez me some paper. 4Tar2y you a lit2le-a-while. 24[Writes] 2QUICKLY. 2[Aside to SIMPLE] 2I am glad he is so quiet; if he 4had be2n throughly moved, you should have heard him 4so loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding, man, I'l2 4do you your master what go2d I can; and the very yea and 4the no is, the French doctor, my master-I may cal2 him 4my master, lo2k you, for I ke2p his house; and I wash, 4wring, brew, bake, scour, dres2 meat and drink, make the 4beds, and do al2 myself- 2SIMPLE. 2[Aside to QUICKLY] 2'Tis a great charge to come 4under one body's hand. 2QUICKLY. 2[Aside to SIMPLE] 2Are you avis'd o' that? You 6shal2 find it a great charge; and to be up early and down 4late; but notwithstanding-to tel2 you in your ear, I would 4have no words of it-my master himself is in love with 4Mistres2 An2e Page; but notwithstanding that, I know 4An2e's mind-that's neither here nor there. 2CAIUS. You jack'nape; give-a this let2er to Sir Hugh; by gar, 4it is a shal2enge; I wil2 cut his troat in de park; and I wil2 4teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest to med2le or make. You 4may be gone; it is not go2d you tar2y here. By gar, I wil2 4cut al2 his two stones; by gar, he shal2 not have a stone 4to throw at his dog. 29Exit SIMPLE 2QUICKLY. Alas, he speaks but for his friend. 2CAIUS. It is no mat2er-a ver dat. Do not you tel2-a me dat I 4shal2 have An2e Page for myself? By gar, I vil2 kil2 de Jack 4priest; and I have ap2ointed mine host of de Jarte2r to 4measure our weapon. By gar, I wil2 myself have An2e 4Page. 2QUICKLY. Sir, the maid loves you, and al2 shal2 be wel2. We 4must give folks leave to prate. What the go2d-year! 2CAIUS. Rugby, come to the court with me. By gar, if I have 6not An2e Page, I shal2 turn your head out of my do2r. 4Fol2ow my he2ls, Rugby. 15Exeunt CAIUS and RUGBY 2QUICKLY. You shal2 have-An fo2l's-head of your own. No, 4I know An2e's mind for that; never a woman in Windsor 4knows more of An2e's mind than I do; nor can do more 4than I do with her, I thank heaven. 2FENTON. 2[Within] 2Who's within there? ho! 2QUICKLY. Who's there, I trow? Come near the house, I pray 4you. 26Enter FENTON 2FENTON. How now, go2d woman, how dost thou? 2QUICKLY. The bet2er that it pleases your go2d worship to 4ask. 2FENTON. What news? How does pret2y Mistres2 An2e? 2QUICKLY. In truth, sir, and she is pret2y, and honest, and 4gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tel2 you that by 4the way; I praise heaven for it. 2FENTON. Shal2 I do any go2d, think'st thou? Shal2 I not lose 6my suit? 2QUICKLY. Troth, sir, al2 is in His hands above; but 4notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'l2 be sworn on a bo2k 4she loves you. Have not your worship a wart above your eye? 2FENTON. Yes, mar2y, have I; what of that? 2QUICKLY. Wel2, thereby hangs a tale; go2d faith, it is such 4another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever broke 4bread. We had an hour's talk of that wart; I shal2 never 4laugh but in that maid's company! But, inde2d, she is 4given to2 much to al2icholy and musing; but for you-wel2, 4go to. 2FENTON. Wel2, I shal2 se2 her to-day. Hold, there's money 4for the2; let me have thy voice in my behalf. If thou se2st 4her before me, com2end me. 2QUICKLY. Wil2 I? I' faith, that we wil2; and I wil2 tel2 your 4worship more of the wart the next time we have confidence; 4and of other wo2ers. 2FENTON. Wel2, farewel2; I am in great haste now. 2QUICKLY. Farewel2 to your worship. 2[Exit FENTON] 2Truly, 4an honest gentleman; but An2e loves him not; for I know 6An2e's mind as wel2 as another does. Out upon 't, what 4have I forgot? 42Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. SCENE 1.Before PAGE'S houseEnter MISTRES2 PAGE, with a let2er 2MRS. PAGE. What! have I scap'd love-let2ers in the holiday-time 4of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them? Let 4me se2. 46[Reads] 4'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though Love use 4Reason for his precisian, he admits him not for his counsel2or. 4You are not young, no more am I; go to, then, there's 4sympathy. You are mer2y, so am I; ha! ha! then there's 4more sympathy. You love sack, and so do I; would you 4desire bet2er sympathy? Let it suf2ice the2, Mistres2 Page 4at the least, if the love of soldier can suf2ice-that I love 4the2. I wil2 not say, Pity me: 'tis not a soldier-like phrase; 4but I say, Love me. By me, 4Thine own true knight, 4By day or night, 4Or any kind of light, 4With al2 his might, 6For the2 to fight, 4JOHN FALSTAF2.' 4What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked, wicked world! 4One that is wel2-nigh worn to pieces with age to show 4himself a young gal2ant! What an unweighed behaviour 4hath this Flemish drunkard pick'd-with the devil's name! 4-out of my conversation, that he dares in this man2er 4as2ay me? Why, he hath not be2n thrice in my company! 4What should I say to him? I was then frugal of my mirth. 4Heaven forgive me! Why, I'l2 exhibit a bil2 in the parliament 4for the put2ing down of men. How shal2 I be 4reveng'd on him? for reveng'd I wil2 be, as sure as his guts 4are made of pud2ings. 23Enter MISTRES2 FORD 2MRS. FORD. Mistres2 Page! trust me, I was going to your 4house. 2MRS. PAGE. And, trust me, I was coming to you. You lo2k 4very il2. 4MRS. FORD. Nay, I'l2 ne'er believe that; I have to show to 4the contrary. 2MRS. PAGE. Faith, but you do, in my mind. 2MRS. FORD. Wel2, I do, then; yet, I say, I could show you to 4the contrary. O Mistres2 Page, give me some counsel. 2MRS. PAGE. What's the mat2er, woman? 2MRS. FORD. O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, 4I could come to such honour! 2MRS. PAGE. Hang the trifle, woman; take the honour. What 4is it? Dispense with trifles; what is it? 2MRS. FORD. If I would but go to hel2 for an eternal moment 4or so, I could be knighted. 2MRS. PAGE. What? Thou liest. Sir Alice Ford! These knights 4wil2 hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy 4gentry. 2MRS. FORD. We burn daylight. Here, read, read; perceive 4how I might be knighted. I shal2 think the worse of fat 4men as long as I have an eye to make dif2erence of men's 4liking. And yet he would not swear; prais'd women's 4modesty, and gave such orderly and wel2-behaved repro2f 6to al2 uncomelines2 that I would have sworn his disposition 4would have gone to the truth of his words; but they do no 4more adhere and ke2p place together than the Hundredth 4Psalm to the tune of 'Gre2nsle2ves.' What tempest, I trow, 4threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his bel2y, 4ashore at Windsor? How shal2 I be revenged on him? I 4think the best way were to entertain him with hope, til2 4the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease. 4Did you ever hear the like? 2MRS. PAGE. Let2er for let2er, but that the name of Page and 4Ford dif2ers. To thy great comfort in this mystery of il2 4opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy let2er; but let thine 4inherit first, for, I protest, mine never shal2. I war2ant he 4hath a thousand of these let2ers, writ with blank space for 4dif2erent names-sure, more!-and these are of the second 4edition. He wil2 print them, out of doubt; for he cares not 4what he puts into the pres2 when he would put us two. I 4had rather be a giantes2 and lie under Mount Pelion. Wel2, 4I wil2 find you twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste 4man. 4MRS. FORD. Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the 4very words. What doth he think of us? 2MRS. PAGE. Nay, I know not; it makes me almost ready to 4wrangle with mine own honesty. I'l2 entertain myself like 4one that I am not acquainted withal; for, sure, unles2 he 4know some strain in me that I know not myself, he would 4never have boarded me in this fury. 2MRS. FORD. 'Boarding' cal2 you it? I'l2 be sure to ke2p him 4above deck. 2MRS. PAGE. So wil2 I; if he come under my hatches, I'l2 never 4to sea again. Let's be reveng'd on him; let's ap2oint him a 4me2ting, give him a show of comfort in his suit, and lead 4him on with a fine-baited delay, til2 he hath pawn'd his 4horses to mine host of the Garter. 2MRS. FORD. Nay, I wil2 consent to act any vil2ainy against 4him that may not sul2y the charines2 of our honesty. O 4that my husband saw this let2er! It would give eternal fo2d 4to his jealousy. 2MRS. PAGE. Why, lo2k where he comes; and my go2d man 4to2; he's as far from jealousy as I am from giving him 6cause; and that, I hope, is an unmeasurable distance. 2MRS. FORD. You are the hap2ier woman. 2MRS. PAGE. Let's consult together against this greasy knight. 4Come hither. 35[They retire] 11Enter FORD with PISTOL, and PAGE with Nym 2FORD. Wel2, I hope it be not so. 2PISTOL. Hope is a curtal dog in some af2airs. 4Sir John af2ects thy wife. 2FORD. Why, sir, my wife is not young. 2PISTOL. He wo2s both high and low, both rich and po2r, 4Both young and old, one with another, Ford; 4He loves the gal2imaufry. Ford, perpend. 2FORD. Love my wife! 2PISTOL. With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou, 4Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwo2d at thy he2ls. 4O, odious is the name! 2FORD. What name, sir? 2PISTOL. The horn, I say. Farewel2. 6Take he2d, have open eye, for thieves do fo2t by night; 4Take he2d, ere sum2er comes, or cucko2 birds do sing. 4Away, Sir Corporal Nym. 4Believe it, Page; he speaks sense. 15Exit PISTOL 2FORD. 2[Aside] 2I wil2 be patient; I wil2 find out this. 2NYM. 2[To PAGE] 2And this is true; I like not the humour of 4lying. He hath wronged me in some humours; I should 4have borne the humour'd let2er to her; but I have a sword, 4and it shal2 bite upon my neces2ity. He loves your wife; 4there's the short and the long. 4My name is Corporal Nym; I speak, and I avouch; 4'Tis true. My name is Nym, and Falstaf2 loves your wife. 4Adieu! I love not the humour of bread and che2se; and 4there's the humour of it. Adieu. 20Exit Nym 2PAGE. 'The humour of it,' quoth 'a! Here's a fel2ow frights 4English out of his wits. 2FORD. I wil2 se2k out Falstaf2. 2PAGE. I never heard such a drawling, af2ecting rogue. 2FORD. If I do find it-wel2. 2PAGE. I wil2 not believe such a Cataian though the priest o' 6th' town com2ended him for a true man. 2FORD. 'Twas a go2d sensible fel2ow. Wel2. 13MISTRES2 PAGE and MISTRES2 FORD come forward 2PAGE. How now, Meg! 2MRS. PAGE. Whither go you, George? Hark you. 2MRS. FORD. How now, swe2t Frank, why art thou melancholy? 2FORD. I melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you home; 4go. 2MRS. FORD. Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head now. 4Wil2 you go, Mistres2 Page? 21Enter MISTRES2 QUICKLY 2MRS. PAGE. Have with you. You'l2 come to din2er, George? 4[Aside to MRS. FORD] 2Lo2k who comes yonder; she shal2 4be our mes2enger to this paltry knight. 2MRS. FORD. 2[Aside to MRS. PAGE] 2Trust me, I thought on 4her; she'l2 fit it. 4MRS. PAGE. You are come to se2 my daughter An2e? 2QUICKLY. Ay, forso2th; and, I pray, how does go2d Mistres2 An2e? 2MRS. PAGE. Go in with us and se2; we have an hour's talk 4with you. 11Exeunt MISTRES2 PAGE, MISTRES2 FORD, and 48MISTRES2 QUICKLY 2PAGE. How now, Master Ford! 2FORD. You heard what this knave told me, did you not? 2PAGE. Yes; and you heard what the other told me? 2FORD. Do you think there is truth in them? 2PAGE. Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would of2er it; 4but these that ac2use him in his intent towards our 4wives are a yoke of his discarded men; very rogues, now 4they be out of service. 2FORD. Were they his men? 2PAGE. Mar2y, were they. 2FORD. I like it never the bet2er for that. Does he lie at the 4Garter? 2PAGE. Ay, mar2y, does he. If he should intend this voyage 4toward my wife, I would turn her lo2se to him; and what 4he gets more of her than sharp words, let it lie on my head. 4FORD. I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to 4turn them together. A man may be to2 confident. I would 4have nothing lie on my head. I can2ot be thus satisfied. 27Enter HOST 2PAGE. Lo2k where my ranting host of the Garter comes. 4There is either liquor in his pate or money in his purse 4when he lo2ks so mer2ily. How now, mine host! 2HOST. How now, bul2y ro2k! Thou'rt a gentleman. 2[To 4SHAL2OW fol2owing] 2Cavaleiro Justice, I say. 25Enter SHAL2OW 2SHAL2OW. I fol2ow, mine host, I fol2ow. Go2d even and 4twenty, go2d Master Page! Master Page, wil2 you go with 4us? We have sport in hand. 2HOST. Tel2 him, Cavaleiro Justice; tel2 him, bul2y ro2k. 2SHAL2OW. Sir, there is a fray to be fought betwe2n Sir Hugh 4the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor. 4FORD. Go2d mine host o' th' Garter, a word with you. 2HOST. What say'st thou, my bul2y ro2k? 9[They go aside] 2SHAL2OW. 2[To PAGE] Wil2 you go with us to behold it? My 4mer2y host hath had the measuring of their weapons; and, 4I think, hath ap2ointed them contrary places; for, believe 4me, I hear the parson is no jester. Hark, I wil2 tel2 you 4what our sport shal2 be. 15[They converse apart] 2HOST. Hast thou no suit against my knight, my guest-cavaleiro. 2FORD. None, I protest; but I'l2 give you a pot2le of burnt 4sack to give me recourse to him, and tel2 him my name is 4Bro2k-only for a jest. 2HOST. My hand, bul2y; thou shalt have egres2 and regres2- 4said I wel2?-and thy name shal2 be Bro2k. It is a mer2y 4knight. Wil2 you go, Mynhe2rs? 2SHAL2OW. Have with you, mine host. 2PAGE. I have heard the Frenchman hath go2d skil2 in his 4rapier. 2SHAL2OW. Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these 4times you stand on distance, your pas2es, stoc2adoes, and 4I know not what. 'Tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis here, 6'tis here. I have se2n the time with my long sword I would 4have made you four tal2 fel2ows skip like rats. 2HOST. Here, boys, here, here! Shal2 we wag? 2PAGE. Have with you. I had rather hear them scold than 4fight. 35Exeunt al2 but FORD 2FORD. Though Page be a secure fo2l, and stands so firmly on 4his wife's frailty, yet I can2ot put of2 my opinion so 4easily. She was in his company at Page's house, and what 4they made there I know not. Wel2, I wil2 lo2k further into 4't, and I have a disguise to sound Falstaf2. If I find her 4honest, I lose not my labour; if she be otherwise, 'tis labour 4wel2 bestowed. 42ExitSCENE 2.A ro2m in the Garter In2Enter FALSTAF2 and PISTOL 2FALSTAF2. I wil2 not lend the2 a pen2y. 2PISTOL. I wil2 retort the sum in equipage. 2FALSTAF2. Not a pen2y. 2PISTOL. Why, then the world's mine oyster. Which I with 4sword wil2 open. 2FALSTAF2. Not a pen2y. I have be2n content, sir, you should 4lay my countenance to pawn. I have grated upon my go2d 4friends for thre2 reprieves for you and your coach-fel2ow, 4Nym; or else you had lo2k'd through the grate, like a 4geminy of babo2ns. I am damn'd in hel2 for swearing to 4gentlemen my friends you were go2d soldiers and tal2 fel2ows; 4and when Mistres2 Bridget lost the handle of her fan, 4I to2k 't upon mine honour thou hadst it not. 2PISTOL. Didst not thou share? Hadst thou not fifte2n pence? 2FALSTAF2. Reason, you rogue, reason. Think'st thou I'l2 4endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more about me, 6I am no gib2et for you. Go-a short knife and a throng!- 4to your manor of Pickt-hatch; go. You'l2 not bear a let2er 4for me, you rogue! You stand upon your honour! Why, 4thou unconfinable basenes2, it is as much as I can do to 4ke2p the terms of my honour precise. I, I, I myself 4sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand, and hiding 4mine honour in my neces2ity, am fain to shuf2le, to hedge, 4and to lurch; and yet you, rogue, wil2 ensconce your rags, 4your cat-a-mountain lo2ks, your red-lat2ice phrases, and 4your bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your honour! 4You wil2 not do it, you! 2PISTOL. I do relent; what would thou more of man? 26Enter ROBIN 2ROBIN. Sir, here's a woman would speak with you. 2FALSTAF2. Let her ap2roach. 21Enter MISTRES2 QUICKLY 4QUICKLY. Give your worship go2d mor2ow. 2FALSTAF2. Go2d mor2ow, go2d wife. 2QUICKLY. Not so, an't please your worship. 2FALSTAF2. Go2d maid, then. 2QUICKLY. I'l2 be sworn; 4As my mother was, the first hour I was born. 2FALSTAF2. I do believe the swearer. What with me? 2QUICKLY. Shal2 I vouchsafe your worship a word or two? 2FALSTAF2. Two thousand, fair woman; and I'l2 vouchsafe 4the2 the hearing. 2QUICKLY. There is one Mistres2 Ford, sir-I pray, come a lit2le 4nearer this ways. I myself dwel2 with Master Doctor 4Caius. 2FALSTAF2. Wel2, on: Mistres2 Ford, you say- 2QUICKLY. Your worship says very true. I pray your worship 4come a lit2le nearer this ways. 2FALSTAF2. I war2ant the2 nobody hears-mine own people, 4mine own people. 2QUICKLY. Are they so? God bles2 them, and make them his 4servants! 4FALSTAF2. Wel2; Mistres2 Ford, what of her? 2QUICKLY. Why, sir, she's a go2d creature. Lord, Lord, your 4worship's a wanton! Wel2, heaven forgive you, and al2 of 4us, I pray. 2FALSTAF2. Mistres2 Ford; come, Mistres2 Ford- 2QUICKLY. Mar2y, this is the short and the long of it: you 4have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis wonderful. 4The best courtier of them al2, when the court lay at Windsor, 4could never have brought her to such a canary. Yet 4there has be2n knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with 4their coaches; I war2ant you, coach after coach, let2er after 4let2er, gift after gift; smel2ing so swe2tly, al2 musk, and so 4rushling, I war2ant you, in silk and gold; and in such al2igant 4terms; and in such wine and sugar of the best and the 4fairest, that would have won any woman's heart; and I 4war2ant you, they could never get an eye-wink of her. 4I had myself twenty angels given me this morning; but I 4defy al2 angels, in any such sort, as they say, but in the 4way of honesty; and, I war2ant you, they could never get 4her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them al2; 6and yet there has be2n earls, nay, which is more, 4pensioners; but, I war2ant you, al2 is one with her. 2FALSTAF2. But what says she to me? Be brief, my go2d she- 4Mercury. 2QUICKLY. Mar2y, she hath receiv'd your let2er; for the 4which she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you 4to notify that her husband wil2 be absence from his house 4betwe2n ten and eleven. 2FALSTAF2. Ten and eleven? 2QUICKLY. Ay, forso2th; and then you may come and se2 4the picture, she says, that you wot of. Master Ford, her 4husband, wil2 be from home. Alas, the swe2t woman leads 4an il2 life with him! He's a very jealousy man; she leads a 4very frampold life with him, go2d heart. 2FALSTAF2. Ten and eleven. Woman, com2end me to her; I 4wil2 not fail her. 2QUICKLY. Why, you say wel2. But I have another mes2enger 4to your worship. Mistres2 Page hath her hearty com2endations 4to you to2; and let me tel2 you in your ear, she's as 4fartuous a civil modest wife, and one, I tel2 you, that wil2 6not mis2 you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in 4Windsor, whoe'er be the other; and she bade me tel2 your 4worship that her husband is seldom from home, but she 4hopes there wil2 come a time. I never knew a woman so 4dote upon a man: surely I think you have charms, la! Yes, 4in truth. 2FALSTAF2. Not I, I as2ure the2; set2ing the at2raction of my 4go2d parts aside, I have no other charms. 2QUICKLY. Bles2ing on your heart for 't! 2FALSTAF2. But, I pray the2, tel2 me this: has Ford's wife and 4Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me? 2QUICKLY. That were a jest inde2d! They have not so lit2le 4grace, I hope-that were a trick inde2d! But Mistres2 Page 4would desire you to send her your lit2le page of al2 loves. 4Her husband has a marvel2ous infection to the lit2le page; 4and truly Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in 4Windsor leads a bet2er life than she does; do what she wil2, 4say what she wil2, take al2, pay al2, go to bed when she 4list, rise when she list, al2 is as she wil2; and truly she 4deserves it; for if there be a kind woman in Windsor, she 6is one. You must send her your page; no remedy. 2FALSTAF2. Why, I wil2. 2QUICKLY. Nay, but do so then; and, lo2k you, he may come 4and go betwe2n you both; and in any case have a 4nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and the boy 4never ne2d to understand any thing; for 'tis not go2d that 4children should know any wickednes2. Old folks, you 4know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world. 2FALSTAF2. Fare the2 wel2; com2end me to them both. 4There's my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with 4this woman. 2[Exeunt QUICKLY and ROBIN] 2This news 4distracts me. 2PISTOL. 2[Aside] 2This punk is one of Cupid's car2iers; 4Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights; 4Give fire; she is my prize, or ocean whelm them al2! 4Exit 2FALSTAF2. Say'st thou so, old Jack; go thy ways; I'l2 make 4more of thy old body than I have done. Wil2 they yet lo2k 4after the2? Wilt thou, after the expense of so much money, 4be now a gainer? Go2d body, I thank the2. Let them say 4'tis gros2ly done; so it be fairly done, no mat2er. 27Enter BARDOLPH 2BARDOLPH. Sir John, there's one Master Bro2k below would 4fain speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath 4sent your worship a moming's draught of sack. 2FALSTAF2. Bro2k is his name? 2BARDOLPH. Ay, sir. 2FALSTAF2. Cal2 him in. 2[Exit BARDOLPH] 2Such Bro2ks are 4welcome to me, that o'erflows such liquor. Ah, ha! Mistres2 4Ford and Mistres2 Page, have I encompas2'd you? Go to; 4via! 14Re-enter BARDOLPH, with FORD disguised 2FORD. Bles2 you, sir! 2FALSTAF2. And you, sir! Would you speak with me? 2FORD. I make bold to pres2 with so lit2le preparation upon 4you. 2FALSTAF2. You're welcome. What's your wil2? Give us leave, 6drawer. 40Exit BARDOLPH 2FORD. Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name 4is Bro2k. 2FALSTAF2. Go2d Master Bro2k, I desire more acquaintance 4of you. 2FORD. Go2d Sir John, I sue for yours-not to charge you; for I 4must let you understand I think myself in bet2er plight for 4a lender than you are; the which hath something 4embold'ned me to this unseason'd intrusion; for they say, if 4money go before, al2 ways do lie open. 2FALSTAF2. Money is a go2d soldier, sir, and wil2 on. 2FORD. Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me; if 4you wil2 help to bear it, Sir John, take al2, or half, for easing 4me of the car2iage. 2FALSTAF2. Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your 4porter. 2FORD. I wil2 tel2 you, sir, if you wil2 give me the hearing. 2FALSTAF2. Speak, go2d Master Bro2k; I shal2 be glad to be 4your servant. 2FORD. Sir, I hear you are a scholar-I wil2 be brief with you 6-and you have be2n a man long known to me, though I 4had never so go2d means as desire to make myself acquainted 4with you. I shal2 discover a thing to you, wherein 4I must very much lay open mine own imperfection; but, 4go2d Sir John, as you have one eye upon my fol2ies, as you 4hear them unfolded, turn another into the register of your 4own, that I may pas2 with a repro2f the easier, sith you 4yourself know how easy is it to be such an of2ender. 2FALSTAF2. Very wel2, sir; proce2d. 2FORD. There is a gentlewoman in this town, her husband's 4name is Ford. 2FALSTAF2. Wel2, sir. 2FORD. I have long lov'd her, and, I protest to you, bestowed 4much on her; fol2owed her with a doting observance; 4engros2'd op2ortunities to me2t her; fe2'd every slight oc2asion 4that could but nig2ardly give me sight of her; not 4only bought many presents to give her, but have given 4largely to many to know what she would have given; 4briefly, I have pursu'd her as love hath pursued me; which 4hath be2n on the wing of al2 oc2asions. But whatsoever I 6have merited, either in my mind or in my means, me2d, I 4am sure, I have received none, unles2 experience be a jewel; 4that I have purchased at an infinite rate, and that hath 4taught me to say this: 4'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues; 4Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.' 2FALSTAF2. Have you receiv'd no promise of satisfaction at 4her hands? 2FORD. Never. 2FALSTAF2. Have you importun'd her to such a purpose? 2FORD. Never. 4FALSTAF2. Of what quality was your love, then? 2FORD. Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so 4that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where 4erected it. 2FALSTAF2. To what purpose have you unfolded this to me? 2FORD. When I have told you that, I have told you al2. Some 4say that though she ap2ear honest to me, yet in other 4places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd 4construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here is the heart 6of my purpose: you are a gentleman of excel2ent 4bre2ding, admirable discourse, of great admit2ance, authentic in 4your place and person, general2y al2ow'd for your many 4war-like, courtlike, and learned preparations. 2FALSTAF2. O, sir! 2FORD. Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend it, 4spend it; spend more; spend al2 I have; only give me so 4much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an amiable 4siege to the honesty of this Ford's wife; use your art of 4wo2ing, win her to consent to you; if any man may, you 4may as so2n as any. 4FALSTAF2. Would it ap2ly wel2 to the vehemency of your 4af2ection, that I should win what you would enjoy? 4Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously. 2FORD. O, understand my drift. She dwel2s so securely on the 4excel2ency of her honour that the fol2y of my soul dares 4not present itself; she is to2 bright to be lo2k'd against. 4Now, could I come to her with any detection in my hand, 4my desires had instance and argument to com2end themselves; 4I could drive her then from the ward of her purity, 6her reputation, her mar2iage vow, and a thousand other her 4defences, which now are to2 to2 strongly embat2l'd against 4me. What say you to't, Sir John? 2FALSTAF2. Master Bro2k, I wil2 first make bold with your 4money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a gentleman, 4you shal2, if you wil2, enjoy Ford's wife. 2FORD. O go2d sir! 2FALSTAF2. I say you shal2. 2FORD. Want no money, Sir John; you shal2 want none. 2FALSTAF2. Want no Mistres2 Ford, Master Bro2k; you shal2 4want none. I shal2 be with her, I may tel2 you, by her own 4ap2ointment; even as you came in to me her as2istant, or 4go-betwe2n, parted from me; I say I shal2 be with her betwe2n 4ten and eleven; for at that time the jealous rascal2y 4knave, her husband, wil2 be forth. Come you to me at 4night; you shal2 know how I spe2d. 2FORD. I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford, 4Sir? 2FALSTAF2. Hang him, po2r cuckoldly knave! I know him 4not; yet I wrong him to cal2 him po2r; they say the 6jealous wit2ol2y knave hath mas2es of money; for the which 4his wife se2ms to me wel2-favour'd. I wil2 use her as the 4key of the cuckoldly rogue's cof2er; and there's my harvest-home. 2FORD. I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him 4if you saw him. 2FALSTAF2. Hang him, mechanical salt-but2er rogue! I wil2 4stare him out of his wits; I wil2 awe him with my cudgel; 4it shal2 hang like a meteor o'er the cuckold's horns. Master 4Bro2k, thou shalt know I wil2 predominate over the 4peasant, and thou shalt lie with his wife. Come to me so2n at 4night. Ford's a knave, and I wil2 ag2ravate his style; thou, 4Master Bro2k, shalt know him for knave and cuckold. 4Come to me so2n at night. 31Exit 2FORD. What a damn'd Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is 4ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is improvident 4jealousy? My wife hath sent to him; the hour is fix'd; 4the match is made. Would any man have thought this? Se2 4the hel2 of having a false woman! My bed shal2 be abus'd, 4my cof2ers ransack'd, my reputation gnawn at; and I shal2 4not only receive this vil2ainous wrong, but stand under the 6adoption of abominable terms, and by him that does me 4this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds wel2; Lucifer, 4wel2; Barbason, wel2; yet they are devils' ad2itions, the names 4of fiends. But cuckold! Wit2ol! Cuckold! the devil himself 4hath not such a name. Page is an as2, a secure as2; he wil2 trust 4his wife; he wil2 not be jealous; I wil2 rather trust a Fleming 4with my but2er, Parson Hugh the Welshman with my 4che2se, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bot2le, or a thief to 4walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with herself. Then 4she plots, then she ruminates, then she devises; and what 4they think in their hearts they may ef2ect, they wil2 break 4their hearts but they wil2 ef2ect. God be prais'd for my 4jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour. I wil2 prevent this, detect 4my wife, be reveng'd on Falstaf2, and laugh at Page. 4I wil2 about it; bet2er thre2 hours to2 so2n than a minute 4to2 late. Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold! 5ExitSCENE 3.A field near WindsorEnter CAIUS and RUGBY 2CAIUS. Jack Rugby! 2RUGBY. Sir? 2CAIUS. Vat is de clock, Jack? 2RUGBY.

Master Shal2ow, you have yourself be2n a great fighter, 4though now a man of peace. 2SHAL2OW. Bodykins, Master Page, though I now be old, and 4of the peace, if I se2 a sword out, my finger itches to make 4one. Though we are justices, and doctors, and churchmen, 4Master Page, we have some salt of our youth in us; we are 4the sons of women, Master Page. 2PAGE. 'Tis true, Master Shal2ow. 2SHAL2OW. It wil2 be found so, Master Page. Master Doctor 2CAIUS, I come to fetch you home. I am sworn of the peace; 4you have show'd yourself a wise physician, and Sir Hugh 4hath shown himself a wise and patient churchman. You 4must go with me, Master Doctor. 2HOST. Pardon, Guest Justice.

PAGE. Nay, ke2p your way, lit2le gal2ant; you were 4wont to be a fol2ower, but now you are a leader. Whether 4had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master's he2ls? 2ROBIN. I had rather, forso2th, go before you like a man than 4fol2ow him like a dwarf. 2MRS. PAGE. O, you are a flat2ering boy; now I se2 you'l2 be a 4courtier. 26Enter FORD 2FORD. Wel2 met, Mistres2 Page. Whither go you? 2MRS. PAGE. Truly, sir, to se2 your wife. Is she at home? 2FORD. Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for want of 4company. I think, if your husbands were dead, you two 4would mar2y. 2MRS. PAGE. Be sure of that-two other husbands. 4FORD. Where had you this pret2y weathercock? 2MRS. PAGE. I can2ot tel2 what the dickens his name is my 4husband had him of. What do you cal2 your knight's 4name, sir2ah? 2ROBIN. Sir John Falstaf2. 2FORD. Sir John Falstaf2! 2MRS. PAGE. He, he; I can never hit on's name. There is such 4a league betwe2n my go2d man and he! Is your wife at 4home inde2d? 2FORD. Inde2d she is. 2MRS. PAGE. By your leave, sir. I am sick til2 I se2 her. 38Exeunt MRS. PAGE and ROBIN 2FORD. Has Page any brains? Hath he any eyes? Hath he any 4thinking? Sure, they sle2p; he hath no use of them. Why, 4this boy wil2 car2y a let2er twenty mile as easy as a can2on 4wil2 sho2t pointblank twelve score. He pieces out his wife's 4inclination; he gives her fol2y motion and advantage; and 4now she's going to my wife, and Falstaf2's boy with her. A 4man may hear this show'r sing in the wind. And Falstaf2's 4boy with her! Go2d plots! They are laid; and our revolted 6wives share damnation together. Wel2; I wil2 take him, 4then torture my wife, pluck the bor2owed veil of modesty 4from the so se2ming Mistres2 Page, divulge Page himself 4for a secure and wilful Actaeon; and to these violent proce2dings 4al2 my neighbours shal2 cry aim. 2[Clock strikes] 4The clock gives me my cue, and my as2urance bids me 4search; there I shal2 find Falstaf2. I shal2 be rather prais'd 4for this than mock'd; for it is as positive as the earth is firm 4that Falstaf2 is there. I wil2 go. 5Enter PAGE, SHAL2OW, SLENDER, HOST, SIR HUGH EVANS, 30CAIUS, and RUGBY 2SHAL2OW, PAGE, &C. Wel2 met, Master Ford. 2FORD. Trust me, a go2d knot; I have go2d che2r at home, 4and I pray you al2 go with me. 2SHAL2OW. I must excuse myself, Master Ford. 2SLENDER. And so must I, sir; we have ap2ointed to dine with 4Mistres2 An2e, and I would not break with her for more 4money than I'l2 speak of. 4SHAL2OW. We have linger'd about a match betwe2n An2e 4Page and my cousin Slender, and this day we shal2 have 4our answer. 2SLENDER. I hope I have your go2d wil2, father Page. 2PAGE. You have, Master Slender; I stand whol2y for you. But 4my wife, Master Doctor, is for you altogether. 2CAIUS. Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me; my nursh-a 4Quickly tel2 me so mush. 2HOST. What say you to young Master Fenton? He capers, 4he dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he speaks 4holiday, he smel2s April and May; he wil2 car2y 't, he wil2 4car2y 't; 'tis in his but2ons; he wil2 car2y 't. 2PAGE. Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is 4of no having: he kept company with the wild Prince and 4Poins; he is of to2 high a region, he knows to2 much. No, 4he shal2 not knit a knot in his fortunes with the finger of 4my substance; if he take her, let him take her simply; the 4wealth I have waits on my consent, and my consent goes 4not that way. 2FORD. I bese2ch you, heartily, some of you go home with me 6to din2er: besides your che2r, you shal2 have sport; I wil2 4show you a monster. Master Doctor, you shal2 go; so shal2 4you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh. 2SHAL2OW. Wel2, fare you wel2; we shal2 have the fre2r 4wo2ing at Master Page's. 10Exeunt SHAL2OW and SLENDER 2CAIUS. Go home, John Rugby; I come anon. 12Exit RUGBY 2HOST. Farewel2, my hearts; I wil2 to my honest knight 4Falstaf2, and drink canary with him. 15Exit HOST 2FORD. 2[Aside] 2I think I shal2 drink in pipe-wine first with 4him. I'l2 make him dance.

Here, set it down. 2MRS. PAGE. Give your men the charge; we must be brief. 2MRS. FORD. Mar2y, as I told you before, John and Robert, be 4ready here hard by in the brew-house; and when I sud2enly 4cal2 you, come forth, and, without any pause or 4stag2ering, take this basket on your shoulders. That done, 4trudge with it in al2 haste, and car2y it among the whitsters 4in Datchet Mead, and there empty it in the mud2y ditch 4close by the Thames side. 4Mrs. PAGE. You wil2 do it? 2MRS. FORD. I ha' told them over and over; they lack no 4direction. Be gone, and come when you are cal2'd. 47Exeunt SERVANTS 2MRS. PAGE. Here comes lit2le Robin. 25Enter ROBIN 2MRS. FORD. How now, my eyas-musket, what news with 4you? 2ROBIN. My Master Sir John is come in at your back-do2r, 4Mistres2 Ford, and requests your company. 2MRS. PAGE. You lit2le Jack-a-Lent, have you be2n true to us? 2ROBIN. Ay, I'l2 be sworn. My master knows not of your 4being here, and hath threat'ned to put me into everlasting 4liberty, if I tel2 you of it; for he swears he'l2 turn me away. 2MRS. PAGE. Thou 'rt a go2d boy; this secrecy of thine shal2 4be a tailor to the2, and shal2 make the2 a new doublet and 4hose. I'l2 go hide me. 2MRS. FORD. Do so. Go tel2 thy master I am alone. 2[Exit 4ROBIN] 2Mistres2 Page, remember you your cue. 2MRS. PAGE. I war2ant the2; if I do not act it, his2 me. 48Exit MRS. PAGE 2MRS. FORD. Go to, then; we'l2 use this unwholesome 4humidity, this gros2 wat'ry pumpion; we'l2 teach him to 4know turtles from jays. 22Enter FALSTAF2 2FALSTAF2. Have I caught the2, my heavenly jewel? 4Why, now let me die, for I have liv'd long enough; this is 4the period of my ambition. O this bles2ed hour! 2MRS. FORD. O swe2t Sir John! 2FALSTAF2. Mistres2 Ford, I can2ot cog, I can2ot prate, 4Mistres2 Ford. Now shal2 I sin in my wish; I would thy 4husband were dead; I'l2 speak it before the best lord, I 4would make the2 my lady. 2MRS. FORD. I your lady, Sir John? Alas, I should be a pitiful 4lady. 2FALSTAF2. Let the court of France show me such another. I 6se2 how thine eye would emulate the diamond; thou hast 4the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the 4ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of Venetian admit2ance. 2MRS. FORD. A plain kerchief, Sir John; my brows become 4nothing else, nor that wel2 neither. 2FALSTAF2. By the Lord, thou art a tyrant to say so; thou 4wouldst make an absolute courtier, and the firm fixture of 4thy fo2t would give an excel2ent motion to thy gait in a 4semi-circled farthingale. I se2 what thou wert, if Fortune 4thy foe were, not Nature, thy friend. Come, thou canst not 4hide it. 2MRS. FORD. Believe me, there's no such thing in me. 2FALSTAF2. What made me love the2? Let that persuade the2 4there's something extra-ordinary in the2. Come, I can2ot 4cog, and say thou art this and that, like a many of these 4lisping hawthorn-buds that come like women in men's 4ap2arel, and smel2 like Bucklersbury in simple time; I 4can2ot; but I love the2, none but the2; and thou deserv'st it. 2MRS. FORD. Do not betray me, sir; I fear you love Mistres2 4Page. 4FALSTAF2. Thou mightst as wel2 say I love to walk by the 4Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the re2k of a 4lime-kiln. 2MRS. FORD. Wel2, heaven knows how I love you; and you 4shal2 one day find it. 2FALSTAF2. Ke2p in that mind; I'l2 deserve it. 2MRS. FORD. Nay, I must tel2 you, so you do; or else I could 4not be in that mind. 2ROBIN. 2[Within] 2Mistres2 Ford, Mistres2 Ford! here's 4Mistres2 Page at the do2r, sweating and blowing and lo2king 4wildly, and would ne2ds speak with you presently. 2FALSTAF2. She shal2 not se2 me; I wil2 ensconce me behind 4the ar2as. 2MRS. FORD. Pray you, do so; she's a very tat2ling woman. 38[FALSTAF2 hides himself] 15Re-enter MISTRES2 PAGE and ROBIN 4What's the mat2er? How now! 2MRS. PAGE. O Mistres2 Ford, what have you done? You're 6sham'd, y'are overthrown, y'are undone for ever. 2MRS. FORD. What's the mat2er, go2d Mistres2 Page? 2MRS. PAGE. O wel2-a-day, Mistres2 Ford, having an honest 4man to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion! 2MRS. FORD. What cause of suspicion? 2MRS. PAGE. What cause of suspicion? Out upon you, how 4am I misto2k in you! 2MRS. FORD. Why, alas, what's the mat2er? 2MRS. PAGE. Your husband's coming hither, woman, with al2 4the of2icers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that he 4says is here now in the house, by your consent, to take an 4il2 advantage of his absence. You are undone. 2MRS. FORD. 'Tis not so, I hope. 2MRS. PAGE. Pray heaven it be not so that you have such a 4man here; but 'tis most certain your husband's coming, 4with half Windsor at his he2ls, to search for such a one. I 4come before to tel2 you. If you know yourself clear, why, 4I am glad of it; but if you have a friend here, convey, 4convey him out. Be not amaz'd; cal2 al2 your senses to you; 4defend your reputation, or bid farewel2 to your go2d life 6for ever. 2MRS. FORD. What shal2 I do? There is a gentleman, my dear 4friend; and I fear not mine own shame as much as his peril. 4I had rather than a thousand pound he were out of the 4house. 2MRS. PAGE. For shame, never stand 'you had rather' and 'you 4had rather'! Your husband's here at hand; bethink you of 4some conveyance; in the house you can2ot hide him. O, 4how have you deceiv'd me! Lo2k, here is a basket; if he be 4of any reasonable stature, he may cre2p in here; and throw 4foul linen upon him, as if it were going to bucking, or-it is 4whiting-time-send him by your two men to Datchet 4Mead. 2MRS. FORD. He's to2 big to go in there. What shal2 I do? 2FALSTAF2. 2[Coming forward] 2Let me se2 't, let me se2 't. O, 4let me se2 't! I'l2 in, I'l2 in; fol2ow your friend's counsel; 4I'l2 in. 2MRS. PAGE. What, Sir John Falstaf2! 6[Aside to FALSTAF2] 4Are these your let2ers, knight? 2FALSTAF2. 2[Aside to MRS. PAGE] 2I love the2 and none but 6the2; help me away.-Let me cre2p in here; I'l2 never- 4[Gets into the basket; they cover him with foul linen] 2MRS. PAGE. Help to cover your master, boy. Cal2 your men, 4Mistres2 Ford. You dis2embling knight! 2MRS. FORD. What, John! Robert! John! 16Exit ROBIN 17Re-enter SERVANTS 4Go, take up these clothes here, quickly; where's the 4cowl-staf2? Lo2k how you drumble. Car2y them to the laundres2 4in Datchet Mead; quickly, come. 9Enter FORD, PAGE, CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS 2FORD. Pray you come near. If I suspect without cause, why 4then make sport at me, then let me be your jest; I deserve 4it. How now, whither bear you this? 2SERVANT. To the laundres2, forso2th. 2MRS. FORD. Why, what have you to do whither they bear it? 4You were best med2le with buck-washing. 4FORD. Buck? I would I could wash myself of the buck! 4Buck, buck, buck! ay, buck! I war2ant you, buck; and of 4the season to2, it shal2 ap2ear. 2[Exeunt SERVANTS with 4basket] 2Gentlemen, I have dream'd to-night; I'l2 tel2 you my 4dream. Here, here, here be my keys; ascend my chambers, 4search, se2k, find out. I'l2 war2ant we'l2 unken2el the fox. 4Let me stop this way first. 2[Locking the do2r] 2So, now 4uncape. 2PAGE. Go2d Master Ford, be contented; you wrong yourself 4to2 much. 2FORD. True, Master Page. Up, gentlemen, you shal2 se2 sport 4anon; fol2ow me, gentlemen. 29Exit 2EVANS. This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies. 2CAIUS. By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France; it is not jealous 4in France. 2PAGE. Nay, fol2ow him, gentlemen; se2 the is2ue of his 4search. 24Exeunt EVANS, PAGE, and CAIUS 2MRS. PAGE. Is there not a double excel2ency in this? 2MRS. FORD. I know not which pleases me bet2er, that my 4husband is deceived, or Sir John. 4MRS. PAGE. What a taking was he in when your husband 4ask'd who was in the basket! 2MRS. FORD. I am half afraid he wil2 have ne2d of washing; so 4throwing him into the water wil2 do him a benefit. 2MRS. PAGE. Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would al2 of the 4same strain were in the same distres2. 2MRS. FORD. I think my husband hath some special suspicion 4of Falstaf2's being here, for I never saw him so gros2 in his 4jealousy til2 now. 2MRS. PAGE. I Wil2 lay a plot to try that, and we wil2 yet have 4more tricks with Falstaf2. His dis2olute disease wil2 scarce 4obey this medicine. 2MRS. FORD. Shal2 we send that fo2lish car2ion, Mistres2 4Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the water, 4and give him another hope, to betray him to another 4punishment? 2MRS. PAGE. We wil2 do it; let him be sent for to-mor2ow 4eight o'clock, to have amends. 7Re-enter FORD, PAGE, CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS 4FORD. I can2ot find him; may be the knave brag2'd of that 4he could not compas2. 2MRS. PAGE. 2[Aside to MRS. FORD] 2Heard you that? 2MRS. FORD. You use me wel2, Master Ford, do you? 2FORD. Ay, I do so. 2MRS. FORD. Heaven make you bet2er than your thoughts! 2FORD. Amen. 2MRS. PAGE. You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford. 2FORD. Ay, ay; I must bear it. 2EVANS. If there be any pody in the house, and in the 4chambers, and in the cof2ers, and in the pres2es, heaven forgive 4my sins at the day of judgment! 2CAIUS. Be gar, nor I to2; there is no bodies. 2PAGE. Fie, fie, Master Ford, are you not asham'd? What 4spirit, what devil sug2ests this imagination? I would not ha' 4your distemper in this kind for the wealth of Windsor 4Castle. 2FORD. 'Tis my fault, Master Page; I suf2er for it. 2EVANS. You suf2er for a pad conscience. Your wife is as 6honest a omans as I wil2 desires among five thousand, and five 4hundred to2. 2CAIUS. By gar, I se2 'tis an honest woman. 2FORD. Wel2, I promis'd you a din2er. Come, come, walk in 4the Park. I pray you pardon me; I wil2 hereafter make 4known to you why I have done this. Come, wife, come, 4Mistres2 Page; I pray you pardon me; pray heartly, 4pardon me. 2PAGE. Let's go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we'l2 mock him. 4I do invite you to-mor2ow morning to my house to breakfast; 4after, we'l2 a-birding together; I have a fine hawk for 4the bush. Shal2 it be so? 2FORD. Any thing. 2EVANS. If there is one, I shal2 make two in the company. 2CAIUS. If there be one or two, I shal2 make-a the turd. 2FORD. Pray you go, Master Page. 2EVANS. I pray you now, remembrance to-mor2ow on the 4lousy knave, mine host. 2CAIUS. Dat is go2d; by gar, with al2 my heart. 2EVANS. A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries! 60ExeuntSCENE 4.Before PAGE'S houseEnter FENTON and AN2E PAGE 2FENTON. I se2 I can2ot get thy father's love; 4Therefore no more turn me to him, swe2t Nan. 2AN2E. Alas, how then? 2FENTON. Why, thou must be thyself. 4He doth object I am to2 great of birth; 4And that, my state being gal2'd with my expense, 4I se2k to heal it only by his wealth. 4Besides these, other bars he lays before me, 4My riots past, my wild societies; 4And tel2s me 'tis a thing impos2ible 4I should love the2 but as a property. 2AN2E.2 May be he tel2s you true. 2FENTON. No, heaven so spe2d me in my time to come! 4Albeit I wil2 confes2 thy father's wealth 4Was the first motive that I wo2'd the2, An2e; 4Yet, wo2ing the2, I found the2 of more value 6Than stamps in gold, or sums in sealed bags; 4And 'tis the very riches of thyself 4That now I aim at. 2AN2E. Gentle Master Fenton, 4Yet se2k my father's love; stil2 se2k it, sir. 4If op2ortunity and humblest suit 4Can2ot at2ain it, why then-hark you hither. 43[They converse apart] 8Enter SHAL2OW, SLENDER, and MISTRES2 QUICKLY 2SHAL2OW. Break their talk, Mistres2 Quickly; my kinsman 4shal2 speak for himself. 2SLENDER. I'l2 make a shaft or a bolt on 't; 'slid, 'tis but 4venturing. 2SHAL2OW. Be not dismay'd. 2SLENDER. No, she shal2 not dismay me. I care not for that, 4but that I am afeard. 2QUICKLY. Hark ye, Master Slender would speak a word 4with you. 4AN2E. I come to him. 2[Aside] 2This is my father's choice. 4O, what a world of vile il2-favour'd faults 4Lo2ks handsome in thre2 hundred pounds a year! 2QUICKLY. And how does go2d Master Fenton? Pray you, a 4word with you. 2SHAL2OW. She's coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a 4father! 2SLENDER. I had a father, Mistres2 An2e; my uncle can tel2 4you go2d jests of him. Pray you, uncle, tel2 Mistres2 An2e 4the jest how my father stole two ge2se out of a pen, go2d 4uncle. 2SHAL2OW. Mistres2 An2e, my cousin loves you. 2SLENDER. Ay, that I do; as wel2 as I love any woman in 4Gloucestershire. 2SHAL2OW. He wil2 maintain you like a gentlewoman. 2SLENDER. Ay, that I wil2 come cut and longtail, under the 4degre2 of a squire. 2SHAL2OW. He wil2 make you a hundred and fifty pounds 4jointure. 2AN2E. Go2d Master Shal2ow, let him wo2 for himself. 4SHAL2OW. Mar2y, I thank you for it; I thank you for that 4go2d comfort. She cal2s you, coz; I'l2 leave you. 2AN2E. Now, Master Slender- 2SLENDER. Now, go2d Mistres2 An2e- 2AN2E. What is your wil2? 2SLENDER. My Wil2! 'Od's heartlings, that's a pret2y jest 4inde2d! I ne'er made my wil2 yet, I thank heaven; I am not 4such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise. 2AN2E. I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me? 2SLENDER. Truly, for mine own part I would lit2le or nothing 4with you. Your father and my uncle hath made motions; 4if it be my luck, so; if not, hap2y man be his dole! They 4can tel2 you how things go bet2er than I can. You may ask 4your father; here he comes. 12Enter PAGE and MISTRES2 PAGE 2PAGE. Now, Master Slender! Love him, daughter An2e- 4Why, how now, what does Master Fenton here? 4You wrong me, sir, thus stil2 to haunt my house. 6I told you, sir, my daughter is dispos'd of. 2FENTON. Nay, Master Page, be not impatient. 2MRS. PAGE. Go2d Master Fenton, come not to my child. 2PAGE. She is no match for you. 2FENTON. Sir, wil2 you hear me? 2PAGE. No, go2d Master Fenton. 4Come, Master Shal2ow; come, son Slender; in. 4Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton. 31Exeunt PAGE, SHAL2OW, and SLENDER 2QUICKLY. Speak to Mistres2 Page. 2FENTON. Go2d Mistres2 Page, for that I love your daughter 4In such a righteous fashion as I do, 4Perforce, against al2 checks, rebukes, and man2ers, 4I must advance the colours of my love, 4And not retire. Let me have your go2d wil2. 2AN2E. Go2d mother, do not mar2y me to yond fo2l. 2MRS. PAGE. I mean it not; I se2k you a bet2er husband. 2QUICKLY. That's my master, Master Doctor. 2AN2E. Alas, I had rather be set quick i' th' earth. 4And bowl'd to death with turnips. 4MRS. PAGE. Come, trouble not yourself. Go2d Master 4Fenton, 4I wil2 not be your friend, nor enemy; 4My daughter wil2 I question how she loves you, 4And as I find her, so am I af2ected; 4Til2 then, farewel2, sir; she must ne2ds go in; 4Her father wil2 be angry. 2FENTON. Farewel2, gentle mistres2; farewel2, Nan. 39Exeunt MRS. PAGE and AN2E 2QUICKLY. This is my doing now: 'Nay,' said I 'wil2 you cast 4away your child on a fo2l, and a physician? Lo2k on 4Master Fenton.' This is my doing. 2FENTON. I thank the2; and I pray the2, once to-night 4Give my swe2t Nan this ring. There's for thy pains. 2QUICKLY. Now Heaven send the2 go2d fortune! 2[Exit 4FENTON] 2A kind heart he hath; a woman would run through 4fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I would my 4master had Mistres2 An2e; or I would Master Slender had 4her; or, in so2th, I would Master Fenton had her; I wil2 4do what I can for them al2 thre2, for so I have promis'd, 6and I'l2 be as go2d as my word; but speciously for Master 4Fenton. Wel2, I must of another er2and to Sir John Falstaf2 4from my two mistres2es. What a beast am I to slack it! ExitSCENE 5.The Garter In2Enter FALSTAF2 and BARDOLPH 2FALSTAF2. Bardolph, I say! 2BARDOLPH. Here, sir. 2FALSTAF2. Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in 't. 51Exit BARDOLPH 4Have I liv'd to be car2ied in a basket, like a bar2ow of 4butcher's of2al, and to be thrown in the Thames? Wel2, if 4I be serv'd such another trick, I'l2 have my brains ta'en out 4and but2er'd, and give them to a dog for a new-year's gift. 4The rogues slighted me into the river with as lit2le remorse 4as they would have drown'd a blind bitch's pup2ies, fifte2n 4i' th' lit2er; and you may know by my size that I have 4a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the bot2om were as de2p as 4hel2 I should down. I had be2n drown'd but that the shore 4was shelvy and shal2ow-a death that I abhor; for the water 4swel2s a man; and what a thing should I have be2n when 4had be2n swel2'd! I should have be2n a mountain of 6mum2y. 18Re-enter BARDOLPH, with sack 2BARDOLPH. Here's Mistres2 Quickly, sir, to speak with you 2FALSTAF2. Come, let me pour in some sack to the Thames 4water; for my bel2y's as cold as if I had swal2ow'd 4snowbal2s for pil2s to co2l the reins. Cal2 her in. 2BARDOLPH. Come in, woman. 21Enter MISTRES2 QUICKLY 2QUICKLY. By your leave; I cry you mercy. Give your 4worship go2d mor2ow. 2FALSTAF2. Take away these chalices. Go, brew me a pot2le 4of sack finely. 2BARDOLPH. With eg2s, sir? 2FALSTAF2. Simple of itself; I'l2 no pul2et-sperm in my 4brewage. 2[Exit BARDOLPH] 2How now! 2QUICKLY. Mar2y, sir, I come to your worship from Mistres2 6Ford. 2FALSTAF2. Mistres2 Ford! I have had ford enough; I was 4thrown into the ford; I have my bel2y ful2 of ford. 2QUICKLY. Alas the day, go2d heart, that was not her fault! 4She does so take on with her men; they misto2k their 4erection. 2FALSTAF2. So did I mine, to build upon a fo2lish woman's 4promise. 2QUICKLY. Wel2, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn 4your heart to se2 it. Her husband goes this morning 4a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her betwe2n 4eight and nine; I must car2y her word quickly. She'l2 make 4you amends, I war2ant you. 2FALSTAF2. Wel2, I Wil2 visit her. Tel2 her so; and bid her 4think what a man is. Let her consider his frailty, and then 4judge of my merit. 2QUICKLY. I wil2 tel2 her. 2FALSTAF2. Do so. Betwe2n nine and ten, say'st thou? 2QUICKLY. Eight and nine, sir. 2FALSTAF2. Wel2, be gone; I wil2 not mis2 her. 4QUICKLY. Peace be with you, sir. 26Exit 2FALSTAF2. I marvel I hear not of Master Bro2k; he sent me 4word to stay within. I like his money wel2. O, here he 4comes. 23Enter FORD disguised 2FORD. Bles2 you, sir! 2FALSTAF2. Now, Master Bro2k, you come to know what 4hath pas2'd betwe2n me and Ford's wife? 2FORD. That, inde2d, Sir John, is my busines2. 2FALSTAF2. Master Bro2k, I wil2 not lie to you; I was at her 4house the hour she ap2ointed me. 2FORD. And sped you, sir? 2FALSTAF2. Very il2-favouredly, Master Bro2k. 2FORD. How so, sir; did she change her determination? 2FALSTAF2. No. Master Bro2k; but the peaking cornuto her 4husband, Master Bro2k, dwel2ing in a continual 'larum of 4jealousy, comes me in the instant of our, encounter, after 4we had embrac'd, kis2'd, protested, and, as it were, spoke 6the prologue of our comedy; and at his he2ls a rab2le of his 4companions, thither provoked and instigated by his 4distemper, and, forso2th, to search his house for his wife's 4love. 2FORD. What, while you were there? 2FALSTAF2. While I was there. 2FORD. And did he search for you, and could not find you? 2FALSTAF2. You shal2 hear. As go2d luck would have it, comes 4in one Mistres2 Page, gives intel2igence of Ford's ap2roach; 4and, in her invention and Ford's wife's distraction, they 4convey'd me into a buck-basket. 2FORD. A buck-basket! 2FALSTAF2. By the Lord, a buck-basket! Ram2'd me in with 4foul shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy 4napkins, that, Master Bro2k, there was the rankest compound 4of vil2ainous smel2 that ever of2ended nostril. 2FORD. And how long lay you there? 2FALSTAF2. Nay, you shal2 hear, Master Bro2k, what I have 4suf2er'd to bring this woman to evil for your go2d. Being 4thus cram2'd in the basket, a couple of Ford's knaves, his 6hinds, were cal2'd forth by their mistres2 to car2y me in 4the name of foul clothes to Datchet Lane; they to2k me on 4their shoulders; met the jealous knave their master in the 4do2r; who ask'd them once or twice what they had in their 4basket. I quak'd for fear lest the lunatic knave would have 4search'd it; but Fate, ordaining he should be a cuckold, 4held his hand. Wel2, on went he for a search, and away 4went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master 4Bro2k-I suf2ered the pangs of thre2 several deaths: first, 4an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rot2en 4bel2-wether; next, to be compas2'd like a go2d bilbo in the 4circumference of a peck, hilt to point, he2l to head; and 4then, to be stop2'd in, like a strong distil2ation, with 4stinking clothes that fret2ed in their own grease. Think of that 4-a man of my kidney. Think of that-that am as subject to 4heat as but2er; a man of continual dis2olution and thaw. It 4was a miracle to scape suf2ocation. And in the height of 4this bath, when I was more than half-stew'd in grease, like 4a Dutch dish, to be thrown into the Thames, and co2l'd, 4glowing hot, in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of that 6-his2ing hot. Think of that, Master Bro2k. 2FORD. In go2d sadnes2, sir, I am sor2y that for my sake you 4have suf2er'd al2 this. My suit, then, is desperate; 4you'l2 undertake her no more. 2FALSTAF2. Master Bro2k, I wil2 be thrown into Etna, as I 4have be2n into Thames, ere I wil2 leave her thus. Her 4husband is this morning gone a-birding; I have received from 4her another embas2y of me2ting; 'twixt eight and nine is 4the hour, Master Bro2k. 2FORD. 'Tis past eight already, sir. 2FALSTAF2. Is it? I Wil2 then ad2res2 me to my ap2ointment. 4Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shal2 4know how I spe2d; and the conclusion shal2 be crowned 4with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shal2 have her, Master 4Bro2k; Master Bro2k, you shal2 cuckold Ford. 12Exit 2FORD. Hum! ha! Is this a vision? Is this a dream? Do I sle2p? 4Master Ford, awake; awake, Master Ford. There's a hole 4made in your best coat, Master Ford. This 'tis to be 4mar2ied; this 'tis to have linen and buck-baskets! Wel2, I wil2 4proclaim myself what I am; I wil2 now take the lecher; he 6is at my house. He can2ot scape me; 'tis impos2ible he 4should; he can2ot cre2p into a halfpen2y purse nor into 4a pep2er box. But, lest the devil that guides him should aid 4him, I wil2 search impos2ible places. Though what I am I 4can2ot avoid, yet to be what I would not shal2 not make 4me tame. If I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb 4go with me-I'l2 be horn mad. 28Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE I.Windsor. A stre2tEnter MISTRES2 PAGE, MISTRES2 QUICKLY, and WIL2IAM 2MRS. PAGE. Is he at Master Ford's already, think'st thou? 2QUICKLY. Sure he is by this; or wil2 be presently; but truly 4he is very courageous mad about his throwing into the 4water. Mistres2 Ford desires you to come sud2enly. 2MRS. PAGE. I'l2 be with her by and by; I'l2 but bring my 4young man here to scho2l. Lo2k where his master comes; 4'tis a playing day, I se2. 21Enter SIR HUGH EVANS 4How now, Sir Hugh, no scho2l to-day? 2EVANS. No; Master Slender is let the boys leave to play. 2QUICKLY. Bles2ing of his heart! 2MRS. PAGE. Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits 4nothing in the world at his bo2k; I pray you ask him some 4questions in his ac2idence. 4EVANS. Come hither, Wil2iam; hold up your head; come. 2MRS. PAGE. Come on, sir2ah; hold up your head; answer your 4master; be not afraid. 2EVANS. Wil2iam, how many numbers is in nouns? 2WIL2IAM. Two. 2QUICKLY. Truly, I thought there had be2n one number 4more, because they say 'Od's nouns.' 2EVANS. Peace your tat2lings. What is 'fair,' Wil2iam? 2WIL2IAM. Pulcher. 2QUICKLY. Polecats! There are fairer things than polecats, 4sure. 2EVANS. You are a very simplicity oman; I pray you, peace. 4What is 'lapis,' Wil2iam? 2WIL2IAM. A stone. 2EVANS. And what is 'a stone,' Wil2iam? 2WIL2IAM. A peb2le. 2EVANS. No, it is 'lapis'; I pray you remember in your prain. 2WIL2IAM. Lapis. 2EVANS. That is a go2d Wil2iam. What is he, Wil2iam, that 4does lend articles? 4WIL2IAM. Articles are bor2owed of the pronoun, and be 4thus declined: Singulariter, nominativo; hic, haec, hoc. 2EVANS. Nominativo, hig, hag, hog; pray you, mark: genitivo, 4hujus. Wel2, what is your ac2usative case? 2WIL2IAM. Ac2usativo, hinc. 2EVANS. I pray you, have your remembrance, child. 4Ac2usativo, hung, hang, hog. 2QUICKLY. 'Hang-hog' is Latin for bacon, I war2ant you. 2EVANS. Leave your prab2les, oman. What is the focative 4case, Wil2iam? 2WIL2IAM. O-vocativo, O. 2EVANS. Remember, Wil2iam: focative is caret. 2QUICKLY. And that's a go2d ro2t. 2EVANS. Oman, forbear. 2MRS. PAGE. Peace. 2EVANS. What is your genitive case plural, Wil2iam? 2WIL2IAM. Genitive case? 2EVANS. Ay. 2WIL2IAM. Genitive: horum, harum, horum. 2QUICKLY. Vengeance of Jen2y's case; fie on her! Never 6name her, child, if she be a whore. 2EVANS. For shame, oman. 2QUICKLY. YOU do il2 to teach the child such words. He 4teaches him to hick and to hack, which they'l2 do fast 4enough of themselves; and to cal2 'horum'; fie upon you! 2EVANS. Oman, art thou lunatics? Hast thou no understandings 4for thy cases, and the numbers of the genders? Thou 4art as fo2lish Christian creatures as I would desires. 2MRS. PAGE. Prithe2 hold thy peace. 2EVANS. Show me now, Wil2iam, some declensions of your 4pronouns. 2WIL2IAM. Forso2th, I have forgot. 2EVANS. It is qui, quae, quod; if you forget your qui's, your 4quae's, and your quod's, you must be pre2ches. Go your 4ways and play; go. 2MRS. PAGE. He is a bet2er scholar than I thought he was. 2EVANS.

Come, we stay to2 long. 12ExeuntSCENE 2.FORD'S houseEnter FALSTAF2 and MISTRES2 FORD 2FALSTAF2. Mistres2 Ford, your sor2ow hath eaten up my 4suf2erance. I se2 you are obsequious in your love, and I 4profes2 requital to a hair's breadth; not only, Mistres2 Ford, in 4the simple of2ice of love, but in al2 the ac2outrement, 4complement, and ceremony of it. But are you sure of your 4husband now? 2MRS. FORD. He's a-birding, swe2t Sir John. 2MRS. PAGE. 2[Within] 2What hoa, gos2ip Ford, what hoa! 2MRS. FORD. Step into th' chamber, Sir John. 6Exit FALSTAF2 22Enter MISTRES2 PAGE 2MRS. PAGE. How now, swe2theart, who's at home besides 4yourself? 2MRS. FORD. Why, none but mine own people. 2MRS. PAGE. Inde2d? 4MRS. FORD. No, certainly. 2[Aside to her] 2Speak louder. 2MRS. PAGE. Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here. 2MRS. FORD. Why? 2MRS. PAGE. Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes 4again. He so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails 4against al2 mar2ied mankind; so curses an Eve's daughters, 4of what complexion soever; and so buf2ets himself on the 4forehead, crying 'Pe2r-out, pe2r-out!' that any madnes2 I 4ever yet beheld se2m'd but tamenes2, civility, and patience, 4to this his distemper he is in now. I am glad the fat knight 4is not here. 2MRS. FORD. Why, does he talk of him? 2MRS. PAGE. Of none but him; and swears he was car2ied out, 4the last time he search'd for him, in a basket; protests to 4my husband he is now here; and hath drawn him and the 4rest of their company from their sport, to make another 4experiment of his suspicion. But I am glad the knight is not 4here; now he shal2 se2 his own fo2lery. 2MRS. FORD. How near is he, Mistres2 Page? 2MRS. PAGE. Hard by, at stre2t end; he wil2 be here anon. 4MRS. FORD. I am undone: the knight is here. 2MRS. PAGE. Why, then, you are ut2erly sham'd, and he's but 4a dead man. What a woman are you! Away with him, 4away with him; bet2er shame than murder. 2MRS. FORD. Which way should he go? How should I bestow 4him? Shal2 I put him into the basket again? 18Re-enter FALSTAF2 2FALSTAF2. No, I'l2 come no more i' th' basket. May I not go 4out ere he come? 2MRS. PAGE. Alas, thre2 of Master Ford's brothers watch the 4do2r with pistols, that none shal2 is2ue out; otherwise you 4might slip away ere he came. But what make you here? 2FALSTAF2. What shal2 I do? I'l2 cre2p up into the chimney. 2MRS. FORD. There they always use to discharge their 4birding-pieces. 2MRS. PAGE. Cre2p into the kiln-hole. 2FALSTAF2. Where is it? 2MRS. FORD. He wil2 se2k there, on my word. Neither pres2, 6cof2er, chest, trunk, wel2, vault, but he hath an abstract for 4the remembrance of such places, and goes to them by his 4note. There is no hiding you in the house. 2FALSTAF2. I'l2 go out then. 2MRS. PAGE. If you go out in your own semblance, you die, 4Sir John. Unles2 you go out disguis'd. 2MRS. FORD. How might we disguise him? 2MRS. PAGE. Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman's 4gown big enough for him; otherwise he might put on a 4hat, a muf2ler, and a kerchief, and so escape. 2FALSTAF2. Go2d hearts, devise something; any extremity 4rather than a mischief. 2MRS. FORD. My Maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brainford, has 4a gown above. 2MRS. PAGE. On my word, it wil2 serve him; she's as big as he 4is; and there's her thrum2'd hat, and her muf2ler to2. Run 4up, Sir John. 2MRS. FORD. Go, go, swe2t Sir John. Mistres2 Page and I wil2 4lo2k some linen for your head. 2MRS. PAGE. Quick, quick; we'l2 come dres2 you straight. Put 6on the gown the while. 25Exit FALSTAF2 2MRS. FORD. I would my husband would me2t him in this 4shape; he can2ot abide the old woman of Brainford; he 4swears she's a witch, forbade her my house, and hath 4threat'ned to beat her. 2MRS. PAGE. Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel; and 4the devil guide his cudgel afterwards! 2MRS. FORD. But is my husband coming? 2MRS. PAGE. Ay, in go2d sadnes2 is he; and talks of the basket 4to2, howsoever he hath had intel2igence. 2MRS. FORD. We'l2 try that; for I'l2 ap2oint my men to car2y 4the basket again, to me2t him at the do2r with it as they 4did last time. 2MRS. PAGE. Nay, but he'l2 be here presently; let's go dres2 4him like the witch of Brainford. 2MRS. FORD. I'l2 first direct my men what they shal2 do with 4the basket. Go up; I'l2 bring linen for him straight. 3Exit 2MRS. PAGE. Hang him, dishonest varlet! we can2ot misuse 4him enough. 4We'l2 leave a pro2f, by that which we wil2 do, 6Wives may be mer2y and yet honest to2. 4We do not act that often jest and laugh; 4'Tis old but true: Stil2 swine eats al2 the draf2. 6Exit 12Re-enter MISTRES2 FORD, with two SERVANTS 2MRS. FORD. Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders; 4your master is hard at do2r; if he bid you set it down, obey 4him; quickly, dispatch. 33Exit 2FIRST SERVANT. Come, come, take it up. 2SECOND SERVANT. Pray heaven it be not ful2 of knight again. 2FIRST SERVANT. I hope not; I had lief as bear so much lead. 4Enter FORD, PAGE, SHAL2OW, CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS 2FORD. Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any 4way then to unfo2l me again? Set down the basket, vil2ain! 4Somebody cal2 my wife. Youth in a basket! O you panderly 4rascals, there's a knot, a ging, a pack, a conspiracy 4against me. Now shal2 the devil be sham'd. What, wife, I 6say! Come, come forth; behold what honest clothes you 4send forth to bleaching. 2PAGE. Why, this pas2es, Master Ford; you are not to go lo2se 4any longer; you must be pinion'd. 2EVANS. Why, this is lunatics. This is mad as a mad dog. 2SHAL2OW. Inde2d, Master Ford, this is not wel2, inde2d. 2FORD. So say I to2, sir. 21Re-enter MISTRES2 FORD 4Come hither, Mistres2 Ford; Mistres2 Ford, the honest 4woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that hath 4the jealous fo2l to her husband! I suspect without cause, 4Mistres2, do I? 2MRS. FORD. Heaven be my witnes2, you do, if you suspect 4me in any dishonesty. 2FORD. Wel2 said, brazen-face; hold it out. Come forth, sir2ah. 27[Pul2ing clothes out of the basket] 2PAGE. This pas2es! 2MRS. FORD. Are you not asham'd? Let the clothes alone. 4FORD. I shal2 find you anon. 2EVANS. 'Tis unreasonable. Wil2 you take up your wife's 4clothes? Come away. 2FORD. Empty the basket, I say. 2MRS. FORD. Why, man, why? 2FORD. Master Page, as I am a man, there was one convey'd 4out of my house yesterday in this basket. Why may not 4he be there again? In my house I am sure he is; my 4intel2igence is true; my jealousy is reasonable. 4Pluck me out al2 the linen. 2MRS. FORD. If you find a man there, he shal2 die a flea's 4death. 2PAGE. Here's no man. 2SHAL2OW. By my fidelity, this is not wel2, Master Ford; this 4wrongs you. 2EVANS. Master Ford, you must pray, and not fol2ow the 4imaginations of your own heart; this is jealousies. 2FORD. Wel2, he's not here I se2k for. 2PAGE. No, nor nowhere else but in your brain. 2FORD. Help to search my house this one time. If I find not 6what I se2k, show no colour for my extremity; let me for 4ever be your table sport; let them say of me 'As jealous as 4Ford, that search'd a hol2ow walnut for his wife's leman.' 4Satisfy me once more; once more search with me. 2MRS. FORD. What, hoa, Mistres2 Page! Come you and the old 4woman down; my husband wil2 come into the chamber. 2FORD. Old woman? what old woman's that? 2MRS. FORD. Why, it is my maid's aunt of Brainford. 2FORD. A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not 4forbid her my house? She comes of er2ands, does she? We 4are simple men; we do not know what's brought to pas2 4under the profes2ion of fortune-tel2ing. She works by 4charms, by spel2s, by th' figure, and such daub'ry as this 4is, beyond our element. We know nothing. Come down, you 4witch, you hag you; come down, I say. 2MRS. FORD. Nay, go2d swe2t husband! Go2d gentlemen, let 4him not strike the old woman. 3Re-enter FALSTAF2 in woman's clothes, and MISTRES2 PAGE 4MRS. PAGE. Come, Mother Prat; come. give me your hand. 2FORD. I'l2 prat her. 2[Beating him] 2Out of my do2r, you 4witch, you hag, you. bag2age, you polecat, you ronyon! 4Out, out! I'l2 conjure you, I'l2 fortune-tel2 you. 51Exit FALSTAF2 2MRS. PAGE. Are you not asham'd? I think you have kil2'd the 4po2r woman. 2MRS. FORD. Nay, he wil2 do it. 'Tis a go2dly credit for you. 2FORD. Hang her, witch! 2EVANS. By yea and no, I think the oman is a witch inde2d; I 4like not when a oman has a great peard; I spy a great peard 4under his muf2ler. 2FORD. Wil2 you fol2ow, gentlemen? I bese2ch you fol2ow; 4se2 but the is2ue of my jealousy; if I cry out thus upon no 4trail, never trust me when I open again. 2PAGE. Let's obey his humour a lit2le further. Come, 4gentlemen. 12Exeunt al2 but MRS. FORD and MRS. PAGE 2MRS. PAGE. Trust me, he beat him most pitiful2y. 2MRS. FORD. Nay, by th' mas2, that he did not; he beat him 4most unpitiful2y methought. 4MRS. PAGE. I'l2 have the cudgel hal2ow'd and hung o'er the 4altar; it hath done meritorious service. 2MRS. FORD. What think you? May we, with the war2ant of 4womanho2d and the witnes2 of a go2d conscience, pursue 4him with any further revenge? 2MRS. PAGE. The spirit of wanton2es2 is sure scar'd out of 4him; if the devil have him not in fe2-simple, with fine and 4recovery, he wil2 never, I think, in the way of waste, 4at2empt us again. 2MRS. FORD. Shal2 we tel2 our husbands how we have serv'd 4him? 2MRS. PAGE. Yes, by al2 means; if it be but to scrape the 4figures out of your husband's brains. If they can find in their 4hearts the po2r unvirtuous fat knight shal2 be any further 4af2licted, we two wil2 stil2 be the ministers. 2MRS. FORD. I'l2 war2ant they'l2 have him publicly sham'd; 4and methinks there would be no period to the jest, should 4he not be publicly sham'd. 2MRS. PAGE. Come, to the forge with it then; shape it. I 4would not have things co2l. 27Exeunt 2SCENE 3.The Garter In2Enter HOST and BARDOLPH 2BARDOLPH. Sir, the Germans desire to have thre2 of your 4horses; the Duke himself wil2 be to-mor2ow at court, and 4they are going to me2t him. 2HOST. What duke should that be comes so secretly? I hear 4not of him in the court. Let me speak with the gentlemen; 4they speak English? 2BARDOLPH. Ay, sir; I'l2 cal2 them to you. 2HOST. They shal2 have my horses, but I'l2 make them pay; 4I'l2 sauce them; they have had my house a we2k at 4com2and; I have turn'd away my other guests. They must 4come of2; I'l2 sauce them. Come. 22ExeuntSCENE 4FORD'S houseEnter PAGE, FORD, MISTRES2 PAGE, MISTRES2 FORD, and SIR HUGH EVANS 2EVANS. 'Tis one of the best discretions of a oman as ever 4did lo2k upon. 2PAGE. And did he send you both these let2ers at an instant? 2MRS. PAGE. Within a quarter of an hour. 2FORD. Pardon me, wife. Henceforth, do what thou wilt; 4I rather wil2 suspect the sun with cold 4Than the2 with wanton2es2. Now doth thy honour stand, 4In him that was of late an heretic, 4As firm as faith. 2PAGE. 'Tis wel2, 'tis wel2; no more. 4Be not as extreme in submis2ion as in of2ence; 4But let our plot go forward. Let our wives 4Yet once again, to make us public sport, 4Ap2oint a me2ting with this old fat fel2ow, 4Where we may take him and disgrace him for it. 4FORD. There is no bet2er way than that they spoke of. 2PAGE. How? To send him word they'l2 me2t him in the Park 4at midnight? Fie, fie! he'l2 never come! 2EVANS. You say he has be2n thrown in the rivers; and has 4be2n grievously peaten as an old oman; methinks there 4should be ter2ors in him, that he should not come; 4methinks his flesh is punish'd; he shal2 have no desires. 2PAGE. So think I to2. 2MRS. FORD. Devise but how you'l2 use him when he comes, 4And let us two devise to bring him thither. 2MRS. PAGE. There is an old tale goes that Heme the Hunter, 4Sometime a ke2per here in Windsor Forest, 4Doth al2 the winter-time, at stil2 midnight, 4Walk round about an oak, with great rag2'd horns; 4And there he blasts the tre2, and takes the cat2le, 4And makes milch-kine yield blo2d, and shakes a chain 4In a most hideous and dreadful man2er. 4You have heard of such a spirit, and wel2 you know 4The superstitious idle-headed eld 4Receiv'd, and did deliver to our age, 6This tale of Heme the Hunter for a truth. 2PAGE. Why yet there want not many that do fear 4In de2p of night to walk by this Herne's oak. 4But what of this? 2MRS. FORD. Mar2y, this is our device- 4That Falstaf2 at that oak shal2 me2t with us, 4Disguis'd, like Heme, with huge horns on his head. 2PAGE. Wel2, let it not be doubted but he'l2 come, 4And in this shape. When you have brought him thither, 4What shal2 be done with him? What is your plot? 2MRS. PAGE. That likewise have we thought upon, and 4thus: 4Nan Page my daughter, and my lit2le son, 4And thre2 or four more of their growth, we'l2 dres2 4Like urchins, ouphes, and fairies, gre2n and white, 4With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads, 4And rat2les in their hands; upon a sud2en, 4As Falstaf2, she, and I, are newly met, 4Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once 4With some dif2used song; upon their sight 6We two in great amazednes2 wil2 fly. 4Then let them al2 encircle him about, 4And fairy-like, to pinch the unclean knight; 4And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel, 4In their so sacred paths he dares to tread 4In shape profane. 2MRS. FORD. And til2 he tel2 the truth, 4Let the sup2osed fairies pinch him sound, 4And burn him with their tapers. 2MRS. PAGE. The truth being known, 4We'l2 al2 present ourselves; dis-horn the spirit, 4And mock him home to Windsor. 2FORD. The children must 4Be practis'd wel2 to this or they'l2 nev'r do 't. 2EVANS. I wil2 teach the children their behaviours; and I wil2 4be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the knight with my 4taber. 2FORD. That wil2 be excel2ent. I'l2 go buy them vizards. 2MRS. PAGE. My Nan shal2 be the Que2n of al2 the Fairies, 4Finely at2ired in a robe of white. 4PAGE. That silk wil2 I go buy. 2[Aside] 2And in that time 4Shal2 Master Slender steal my Nan away, 4And mar2y her at Eton.-Go, send to Falstaf2 straight. 2FORD. Nay, I'l2 to him again, in name of Bro2k; 4He'l2 tel2 me al2 his purpose. Sure, he'l2 come. 2MRS. PAGE. Fear not you that. Go get us properties 4And tricking for our fairies. 2EVANS. Let us about it. It is admirable pleasures, and fery 4honest knaveries. 15Exeunt PAGE, FORD, and EVANS 2MRS. PAGE. Go, Mistres2 Ford. 4Send Quickly to Sir John to know his mind. 50Exit MRS. FORD 4I'l2 to the Doctor; he hath my go2d wil2, 4And none but he, to mar2y with Nan Page. 4That Slender, though wel2 landed, is an idiot; 4And he my husband best of al2 af2ects. 4The Doctor is wel2 money'd, and his friends 4Potent at court; he, none but he, shal2 have her, 4Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her. 6ExitSCENE 5.The Garter In2Enter HOST and SIMPLE 2HOST. What wouldst thou have, bo2r? What, thick-skin? 4Speak, breathe, discus2; brief, short, quick, snap. 2SIMPLE. Mar2y, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaf2 4from Master Slender. 2HOST. There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his 4standing-bed and truckle-bed; 'tis painted about with the 4story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go, knock and can; he'l2 4speak like an Anthropophaginian unto the2. Knock, I say. 2SIMPLE. There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into 4his chamber; I'l2 be so bold as stay, sir, til2 she come down; 4I come to speak with her, inde2d. 2HOST. Ha! a fat woman? The knight may be rob2'd. I'l2 cal2. 4Bul2y knight! Bul2y Sir John! Speak from thy lungs 4military. Art thou there? It is thine host, thine Ephesian, cal2s. 2FALSTAF2. 2[Above] 2How now, mine host? 2HOST. Here's a Bohemian-Tartar tar2ies the coming down of 6thy fat woman. Let her descend, bul2y, let her descend; 4my chambers are honourible. Fie, privacy, fie! 20Enter FALSTAF2 2FALSTAF2. There was, mine host, an old fat woman even 4now with, me; but she's gone. 2SIMPLE. Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of 4Brainford? 2FALSTAF2. Ay, mar2y was it, mus2el-shel2. What would you 4with her? 2SIMPLE. My master, sir, my Master Slender, sent to her, 4se2ing her go thorough the stre2ts, to know, sir, whether one 4Nym, sir, that beguil'd him of a chain, had the chain or no. 2FALSTAF2. I spake with the old woman about it. 2SIMPLE. And what says she, I pray, sir? 2FALSTAF2 Mar2y, she says that the very same man that 4beguil'd Master Slender of his chain cozen'd him of it. 2SIMPLE. I would I could have spoken with the woman 4herself; I had other things to have spoken with her to2, 6from him. 2FALSTAF2. What are they? Let us know. 2HOST. Ay, come; quick. 2SIMPLE. I may not conceal them, sir. 2FALSTAF2. Conceal them, or thou diest. 4SIMPLE.2 Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistres2 4An2e Page: to know if it were my master's fortune to 4have her or no. 2FALSTAF2. 'Tis, 'tis his fortune. 2SIMPLE. What sir? 2FALSTAF2. To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me 4so. 2SIMPLE. May I be bold to say so, sir? 2FALSTAF2. Ay, sir, like who more bold? 2SIMPLE., I thank your worship; I shal2 make my master glad 4with these tidings. 30Exit SIMPLE 2HOST. Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was 4there a wise woman with the2? 2FALSTAF2. Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath 4taught me more wit than ever I learn'd before in my life; 6and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for my 4learning. 20Enter BARDOLPH 2BARDOLPH. Out, alas, sir, cozenage, mere cozenage! 2HOST. Where be my horses? Speak wel2 of them, varlet2o. 2BARDOLPH. Run away with the cozeners; for so so2n as I 4came beyond Eton, they threw me of2 from behind one of 4them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away, like 4thre2 German devils, thre2 Doctor Faustuses. 2HOST. They are gone but to me2t the Duke, vil2ain; do not 4say they be fled. Germans are honest men. 17Enter SIR HUGH EVANS 2EVANS. Where is mine host? 2HOST. What is the mat2er, sir? 2EVANS. Have a care of your entertainments. There is a friend 4of mine come to town tel2s me there is thre2 6cozen-germans that has cozen'd al2 the hosts of Readins, 4of Maidenhead, of Colebro2k, of horses and money. I tel2 you for 4go2d wil2, lo2k you; you are wise, and ful2 of gibes and 4vlouting-stogs, and 'tis not convenient you should be 4cozened. Fare you wel2. 33Exit 18Enter DOCTOR CAIUS 2CAIUS. Vere is mine host de Jarte2r? 2HOST. Here, Master Doctor, in perplexity and doubtful 4dilem2a. 2CAIUS. I can2ot tel2 vat is dat; but it is tel2-a me dat you 4make grand preparation for a Duke de Jamany. By my 4trot, dere is no duke that the court is know to come; I 4tel2 you for go2d wil2. Adieu. 26Exit 2HOST. Hue and cry, vil2ain, go! As2ist me, knight; I am 4undone. Fly, run, hue and cry, vil2ain; I am undone. 40Exeunt HOST and BARDOLPH 2FALSTAF2. I would al2 the world might be cozen'd, for I have 4be2n cozen'd and beaten to2. If it should come to the car 6of the court how I have be2n transformed, and how my 4transformation hath be2n wash'd and cudgel2'd, they 4would melt me out of my fat, drop by drop, and liquor 4fishermen's bo2ts with me; I war2ant they would whip me 4with their fine wits til2 I were as crestfal2'n as a dried pear. 4I never prosper'd since I forswore myself at primero. Wel2, 4if my wind were but long enough to say my prayers, 4would repent. 16Enter MISTRES2 QUICKLY 4Now! whence come you? 2QUICKLY. From the two parties, forso2th. 2FALSTAF2. The devil take one party and his dam the other! 4And so they shal2 be both bestowed. I have suf2er'd more 4for their sakes, more than the vil2ainous inconstancy of 4man's disposition is able to bear. 2QUICKLY. And have not they suf2er'd? Yes, I war2ant; 4speciously one of them; Mistres2 Ford, go2d heart, is beaten 4black and blue, that you can2ot se2 a white spot about her. 4FALSTAF2. What tel2'st thou me of black and blue? I was 4beaten myself into al2 the colours of the rainbow; and 4was like to be ap2rehended for the witch of Brainford. But 4that my admirable dexterity of wit, my counterfeiting the 4action of an old woman, deliver'd me, the knave constable 4had set me i' th' stocks, i' th' com2on stocks, for a witch. 2QUICKLY. Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber; you 4shal2 hear how things go, and, I war2ant, to your content. 4Here is a let2er wil2 say somewhat. Go2d hearts, what ado 4here is to bring you together! Sure, one of you does not 4serve heaven wel2, that you are so cros2'd. 2FALSTAF2. Come up into my chamber. 22ExeuntSCENE 6.The Garter In2Enter FENTON and HOST 2HOST. Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy; I 4wil2 give over al2. 2FENTON. Yet hear me speak. As2ist me in my purpose, 4And, as I am a gentleman, I'l2 give the 4A hundred pound in gold more than your los2. 2HOST. I wil2 hear you, Master Fenton; and I wil2, at the least, 4ke2p your counsel. 2FENTON. From time to time I have acquainted you 4With the dear love I bear to fair An2e Page; 4Who, mutual2y, hath answer'd my af2ection, 4So far forth as herself might be her cho2ser, 4Even to my wish. I have a let2er from her 4Of such contents as you wil2 wonder at; 4The mirth whereof so larded with my mat2er 4That neither, singly, can be manifested 4Without the show of both. Fat Falstaf2 6Hath a great scene. The image of the jest 4I'l2 show you here at large. Hark, go2d mine host: 4To-night at Heme's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one, 4Must my swe2t Nan present the Fairy Que2n- 4The purpose why is here-in which disguise, 4While other jests are something rank on fo2t, 4Her father hath com2anded her to slip 4Away with Slender, and with him at Eton 4Im2ediately to mar2y; she hath consented. 4Now, sir, 4Her mother, even strong against that match 4And firm for Doctor Caius, hath ap2ointed 4That he shal2 likewise shuf2le her away 4While other sports are tasking of their minds, 4And at the dean'ry, where a priest at2ends, 4Straight mar2y her. To this her mother's plot 4She se2mingly obedient likewise hath 4Made promise to the doctor. Now thus it rests: 4Her father means she shal2 be al2 in white; 4And in that habit, when Slender se2s his time 6To take her by the hand and bid her go, 4She shal2 go with him; her mother hath intended 4The bet2er to denote her to the doctor- 4For they must al2 be mask'd and vizarded- 4That quaint in gre2n she shal2 be lo2se enrob'd, 4With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head; 4And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe, 4To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token, 4The maid hath given consent to go with him. 2HOST. Which means she to deceive, father or mother? 2FENTON. Both, my go2d host, to go along with me. 4And here it rests-that you'l2 procure the vicar 4To stay for me at church, 'twixt twelve and one, 4And in the lawful name of mar2ying, 4To give our hearts united ceremony. 2HOST. Wel2, husband your device; I'l2 to the vicar. 4Bring you the maid, you shal2 not lack a priest. 2FENTON. So shal2 I evermore be bound to the2; 4Besides, I'l2 make a present recompense. 14Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V.

This is 4the third time; I hope go2d luck lies in od2 numbers. 4Away, go; they say there is divinity in od2 numbers, either 4in nativity, chance, or death. Away. 2QUICKLY.

QUICKLY 17Enter FORD disguised 4How now, Master Bro2k. Master Bro2k, the mat2er wil2 4be known tonight or never. Be you in the Park about 4midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shal2 se2 wonders. 2FORD. Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me 4you had ap2ointed? 4FALSTAF2. I went to her, Master Bro2k, as you se2, like a 4po2r old man; but I came from her, Master Bro2k, like a 4po2r old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband, hath 4the finest mad devil of jealousy in him, Master Bro2k, that 4ever govern'd frenzy. I wil2 tel2 you-he beat me grievously 4in the shape of a woman; for in the shape of man, Master 4Bro2k, I fear not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because 4I know also life is a shut2le. I am in haste; go along with 4me; I'l2. tel2 you al2, Master Bro2k. Since I pluck'd ge2se, 4play'd truant, and whip2'd top, I knew not what 'twas to 4be beaten til2 lately. Fol2ow me. I'l2 tel2 you strange things 4of this knave-Ford, on whom to-night I wil2 be revenged, 4and I wil2 deliver his wife into your hand. Fol2ow. Strange 4things in hand, Master Bro2k! Fol2ow. 17ExeuntSCENE 2.Windsor ParkEnter PAGE, SHAL2OW, and SLENDER 2PAGE. Come, come; we'l2 couch i' th' Castle ditch til2 we 4se2 the light of our fairies. Remember, son Slender, my daughter. 2SLENDER. Ay, forso2th; I have spoke with her, and we have 4a nay-word how to know one another. I come to her in 4white and cry 'mum'; she cries 'budget,' and by that we 4know one another. 2SHAL2OW. That's go2d to2; but what ne2ds either your mum 4or her budget? The white wil2 decipher her wel2 enough. 4It hath struck ten o'clock. 2PAGE. The night is dark; light and spirits wil2 become it wel2. 4Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil but the 4devil, and we shal2 know him by his horns. Let's away; 4fol2ow me. 44ExeuntSCENE 3.A stre2t leading to the ParkEnter MISTRES2 PAGE, MISTRES2 FORD, and DOCTOR CAIUS 2MRS. PAGE. Master Doctor, my daughter is in gre2n; when 4you se2 your time, take her by the hand, away with her to 4the deanery, and dispatch it quickly. Go before into the 4Park; we two must go together. 2CAIUS. I know vat I have to do; adieu. 2MRS. PAGE. Fare you wel2, sir. 2[Exit CAIUS] 2My husband 4wil2 not rejoice so much at the abuse of Falstaf2 as he wil2 4chafe at the doctor's mar2ying my daughter; but 'tis no 4mat2er; bet2er a lit2le chiding than a great deal of 4heartbreak. 2MRS. FORD. Where is Nan now, and her tro2p of fairies, and 4the Welsh devil, Hugh? 2MRS. PAGE. They are al2 couch'd in a pit hard by Heme's 4oak, with obscur'd lights; which, at the very instant of 4Falstaf2's and our me2ting, they wil2 at once display to the 4night. 2MRS. FORD. That can2ot cho2se but amaze him. 2MRS. PAGE. If he be not amaz'd, he wil2 be mock'd; if he be 6amaz'd, he wil2 every way be mock'd. 2MRS. FORD. We'l2 betray him finely. 2MRS. PAGE. Against such lewdsters and their lechery, 4Those that betray them do no treachery. 2MRS. FORD. The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak! 58ExeuntSCENE 4.Windsor ParkEnter SIR HUGH EVANS like a satyr, with OTHERS as fairies 2EVANS. Trib, trib, fairies; come; and remember your parts. 4Be pold, I pray you; fol2ow me into the pit; and when I 4give the watch-ords, do as I pid you. Come, come; trib, 4trib. 49ExeuntSCENE 5.Another part of the ParkEnter FALSTAF2 disguised as HERNE 2FALSTAF2. The Windsor bel2 hath struck twelve; the minute 4draws on. Now the hot-blo2ded gods as2ist me! 4Remember, Jove, thou wast a bul2 for thy Europa; love set on thy 4horns. O powerful love! that in some respects makes a 4beast a man; in some other a man a beast. You were also, 4Jupiter, a swan, for the love of Leda. O omnipotent love! 4how near the god drew to the complexion of a go2se! A 4fault done first in the form of a beast-O Jove, a beastly 4fault!-and then another fault in the semblance of a fowl- 4think on't, Jove, a foul fault! When gods have hot backs 4what shal2 po2r men do? For me, I am here a Windsor 4stag; and the fat2est, I think, i' th' forest. Send me a co2l 4rut-time, Jove, or who can blame me to pis2 my tal2ow? 4Who comes here? my doe? 8Enter MISTRES2 FORD and MISTRES2 PAGE 4MRS. FORD. Sir John! Art thou there, my de2r, my male de2r. 2FALSTAF2. My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain 4potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Gre2nsle2ves, hail 4kis2ing-comfits, and snow eringoes; let there come a tempest 4of provocation, I wil2 shelter me here. 6[Embracing her] 2MRS. FORD. Mistres2 Page is come with me, swe2theart. 2FALSTAF2. Divide me like a brib'd buck, each a haunch; I 4wil2 ke2p my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fel2ow 4of this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands. Am 4I a wo2dman, ha? Speak I like Heme the Hunter? Why, 4now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes restitution. 4As I am a true spirit, welcome! 11[A noise of horns] 2MRS. PAGE. Alas, what noise? 2MRS. FORD. Heaven forgive our sins! 2FALSTAF2. What should this be? 2MRS. FORD. } Away, away. 2MRS. PAGE. } Away, away. 24[They run of2] 2FALSTAF2. I think the devil wil2 not have me damn'd, lest the 4oil that's in me should set hel2 on fire; he would never else 6cros2 me thus. 8Enter SIR HUGH EVANS like a satyr, AN2E PAGE as 6a fairy, and OTHERS as the Fairy Que2n, fairies, and 15Hobgoblin; al2 with tapers 2FAIRY QUE2N. Fairies, black, grey, gre2n, and white, 4You mo2nshine revel2ers, and shades of night, 4You orphan heirs of fixed destiny, 4At2end your of2ice and your quality. 4Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes. 2PUCK. Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys. 4Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap; 4Where fires thou find'st unrak'd, and hearths unswept, 4There pinch the maids as blue as bilber2y; 4Our radiant Que2n hates sluts and slut2ery. 2FALSTAF2. They are fairies; he that speaks to them shal2 die. 4I'l2 wink and couch; no man their works must eye. 39[Lies down upon his face] 2EVANS. Where's Pede? Go you, and where you find a maid 6That, ere she sle2p, has thrice her prayers said, 4Raise up the organs of her fantasy 4Sle2p she as sound as careles2 infancy; 4But those as sle2p and think not on their sins, 4Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides, and shins. 2FAIRY QUE2N. About, about; 4Search Windsor castle, elves, within and out; 4Strew go2d luck, ouphes, on every sacred ro2m, 4That it may stand til2 the perpetual do2m 4In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit, 4Worthy the owner and the owner it. 4The several chairs of order lo2k you scour 4With juice of balm and every precious flower; 4Each fair instalment, coat, and sev'ral crest, 4With loyal blazon, evermore be blest! 4And nightly, meadow-fairies, lo2k you sing, 4Like to the Garter's compas2, in a ring; 4Th' expres2ure that it bears, gre2n let it be, 4More fertile-fresh than al2 the field to se2; 4And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write 6In em'rald tufts, flow'rs purple, blue and white; 4Like sap2hire, pearl, and rich embroidery, 4Buckled below fair knightho2d's bending kne2. 4Fairies use flow'rs for their charactery. 4Away, disperse; but til2 'tis one o'clock, 4Our dance of custom round about the oak 4Of Herne the Hunter let us not forget. 2EVANS. Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set; 4And twenty glow-worms shal2 our lanterns be, 4To guide our measure round about the tre2. 4But, stay. I smel2 a man of mid2le earth. 2FALSTAF2. Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he 4transform me to a piece of che2se! 2PUCK. Vile worm, thou wast o'erlo2k'd even in thy birth. 2FAIRY QUE2N. With trial-fire touch me his finger-end; 4If he be chaste, the flame wil2 back descend, 4And turn him to no pain; but if he start, 4It is the flesh of a cor2upted heart. 2PUCK. A trial, come. 2EVANS. Come, wil2 this wo2d take fire? 15[They put the tapers to his fingers, and he starts] 2FALSTAF2. Oh, oh, oh! 2FAIRY QUE2N. Cor2upt, cor2upt, and tainted in desire! 4About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme; 4And, as you trip, stil2 pinch him to your time. 2THE SONG. 4Fie on sinful fantasy! 4Fie on lust and luxury! 4Lust is but a blo2dy fire, 4Kindled with unchaste desire, 4Fed in heart, whose flames aspire, 4As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher. 4Pinch him, fairies, mutual2y; 4Pinch him for his vil2ainy; 4Pinch him and burn him and turn him about, 4Til2 candles and star-light and mo2nshine be out. 8During this song they pinch FALSTAF2. DOCTOR 8CAIUS comes one way, and steals away a fairy in 8gre2n; SLENDER another way, and takes of2 a fairy in 10white; and FENTON steals away AN2E PAGE. A noise 8of hunting is heard within. Al2 the fairies run away. 8FALSTAF2 pul2s of2 his buck's head, and rises 7Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRES2 PAGE, MISTRES2 FORD, and 24SIR HUGH EVANS 2PAGE. Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch'd you now. 4Wil2 none but Heme the Hunter serve your turn? 2MRS. PAGE. I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher. 4Now, go2d Sir John, how like you Windsor wives? 4Se2 you these, husband? Do not these fair yokes 4Become the forest bet2er than the town? 2FORD. Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Bro2k, 4Falstaf2's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his horns, 4Master Bro2k; and, Master Bro2k, he hath enjoyed nothing of 4Ford's but his buck-basket, his cudgel, and twenty pounds 4of money, which must be paid to Master Bro2k; his horses 4are ar2ested for it, Master Bro2k. 2MRS. FORD. Sir John, we have had il2 luck; we could never 6me2t. I wil2 never take you for my love again; but I wil2 4always count you my de2r. 2FALSTAF2. I do begin to perceive that I am made an as2. 2FORD. Ay, and an ox to2; both the pro2fs are extant. 2FALSTAF2. And these are not fairies? I was thre2 or four 4times in the thought they were not fairies; and yet the 4guiltines2 of my mind, the sud2en surprise of my powers, 4drove the gros2nes2 of the fop2ery into a receiv'd belief, 4in despite of the te2th of al2 rhyme and reason, that they 4were fairies. Se2 now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent 4when 'tis upon il2 employment. 2EVANS. Sir John Falstaf2, serve Got, and leave your desires, 4and fairies wil2 not pinse you. 2FORD. Wel2 said, fairy Hugh. 2EVANS. And leave you your jealousies to2, I pray you. 2FORD. I wil2 never mistrust my wife again, til2 thou art able 4to wo2 her in go2d English. 2FALSTAF2. Have I laid my brain in the sun, and dried it, that 4it wants mat2er to prevent so gros2, o'er-reaching as this? 4Am I rid2en with a Welsh goat to2? Shal2 I have a cox-comb 6of frieze? 'Tis time I were chok'd with a piece of 4toasted che2se. 2EVANS. Se2se is not go2d to give put2er; your bel2y is al2 4put2er. 2FALSTAF2. 'Se2se' and 'put2er'! Have I liv'd to stand at the 4taunt of one that makes frit2ers of English? This is enough 4to be the decay of lust and late-walking through the realm. 2MRS. PAGE. Why, Sir John, do you think, though we would 4have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the head and 4shoulders, and have given ourselves without scruple to hel2, 4that ever the devil could have made you our delight? 2FORD. What, a hodge-pud2ing? a bag of flax? 2MRS. PAGE. A puf2'd man? 2PAGE. Old, cold, wither'd, and of intolerable entrails? 2FORD. And one that is as slanderous as Satan? 2PAGE. And as po2r as Job? 2FORD. And as wicked as his wife? 2EVANS. And given to fornications, and to taverns, and sack, 4and wine, and metheglins, and to drinkings, and swearings, 4and starings, prib2les and prab2les? 4FALSTAF2. Wel2, I am your theme; you have the start of me; 4I am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh flan2el; 4ignorance itself is a plum2et o'er me; use me as you wil2. 2FORD. Mar2y, sir, we'l2 bring you to Windsor, to one Master 4Bro2k, that you have cozen'd of money, to whom you 4should have be2n a pander. Over and above that you have 4suf2er'd, I think to repay that money wil2 be a biting 4af2liction. 2PAGE. Yet be che2rful, knight; thou shalt eat a pos2et 4tonight at my house, where I wil2 desire the2 to laugh at my 4wife, that now laughs at the2. Tel2 her Master Slender hath 4mar2ied her daughter. 2MRS. PAGE. 2[Aside] 2Doctors doubt that; if An2e Page be 4my daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife. 24Enter SLENDER 2SLENDER. Whoa, ho, ho, father Page! 2PAGE. Son, how now! how now, son! Have you dispatch'd'? 2SLENDER. Dispatch'd! I'l2 make the best in Gloucestershire 6know on't; would I were hang'd, la, else! 2PAGE. Of what, son? 2SLENDER. I came yonder at Eton to mar2y Mistres2 An2e 4Page, and she's a great lub2erly boy. If it had not be2n i' 4th' church, I would have swing'd him, or he should have 4swing'd me. If I did not think it had be2n An2e Page, 4would I might never stir!-and 'tis a postmaster's boy. 2PAGE. Upon my life, then, you to2k the wrong. 2SLENDER. What ne2d you tel2 me that? I think so, when I 4to2k a boy for a girl. If I had be2n mar2ied to him, for al2 4he was in woman's ap2arel, I would not have had him. 2PAGE. Why, this is your own fol2y. Did not I tel2 you how 4you should know my daughter by her garments? 2SLENDER. I went to her in white and cried 'mum' and she 4cried 'budget' as An2e and I had ap2ointed; and yet it was 4not An2e, but a postmaster's boy. 2MRS. PAGE. Go2d George, be not angry. I knew of your 4purpose; turn'd my daughter into gre2n; and, inde2d, she 4is now with the Doctor at the dean'ry, and there mar2ied. 27Enter CAIUS 2CAIUS. Vere is Mistres2 Page? By gar, I am cozened; I ha' 4mar2ied un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy; it is 4not An2e Page; by gar, I am cozened. 2MRS. PAGE. Why, did you take her in gre2n? 2CAIUS. Ay, be gar, and 'tis a boy; be gar, I'l2 raise al2 4Windsor. 42Exit CAIUS 2FORD. This is strange. Who hath got the right An2e? 2PAGE. My heart misgives me; here comes Master Fenton. 18Enter FENTON and AN2E PAGE 4How now, Master Fenton! 2AN2E. Pardon, go2d father. Go2d my mother, pardon. 2PAGE. Now, Mistres2, how chance you went not with Master 4Slender? 2MRS. PAGE. Why went you not with Master Doctor, maid? 2FENTON. You do amaze her. Hear the truth of it. 4You would have mar2ied her most shameful2y, 6Where there was no proportion held in love. 4The truth is, she and I, long since contracted, 4Are now so sure that nothing can dis2olve us. 4Th' of2ence is holy that she hath com2it2ed; 4And this deceit loses the name of craft, 4Of disobedience, or unduteous title, 4Since therein she doth evitate and shun 4A thousand ir2eligious cursed hours, 4Which forced mar2iage would have brought upon her. 2FORD. Stand not amaz'd; here is no remedy. 4In love, the heavens themselves do guide the state; 4Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate. 2FALSTAF2. I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand 4to strike at me, that your ar2ow hath glanc'd. 2PAGE. Wel2, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give the2 joy! 4What can2ot be eschew'd must be embrac'd. 2FALSTAF2. When night-dogs run, al2 sorts of de2r are chas'd. 2MRS. PAGE. Wel2, I wil2 muse no further. Master Fenton, 4Heaven give you many, many mer2y days! 4Go2d husband, let us every one go home, 6And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire; 4Sir John and al2. 2FORD. Let it be so. Sir John, 4To Master Bro2k you yet shal2 hold your word; 4For he, to-night, shal2 lie with Mistres2 Ford. 7ExeuntTHE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21596A MIDSUM2ER NIGHT'S DREAMby Wil2iam ShakespeareDRAMATIS PERSONAE 2THESEUS, Duke of Athens 2EGEUS, father to Hermia 2LYSANDER, in love with Hermia 2DEMETRIUS, in love with Hermia 2PHILOSTRATE, Master of the Revels to Theseus 2QUINCE, a carpenter 2SNUG, a joiner 2BOT2OM, a weaver 2FLUTE, a bel2ows-mender 2SNOUT, a tinker 2STARVELING, a tailor 2HIP2OLYTA, Que2n of the Amazons, bethrothed to Theseus 2HERMIA, daughter to Egeus, in love with Lysander 2HELENA, in love with Demetrius 2OBERON, King of the Fairies 2TITANIA, Que2n of the Fairies 2PUCK, or ROBIN GO2DFEL2OW 2PEASEBLOS2OM, fairy 4COBWEB, fairy 2MOTH, fairy 2MUSTARDSE2D, fairy 2PROLOGUE, PYRAMUS, THISBY, WAL2, MO2NSHINE, LION are presented by: 4QUINCE, BOT2OM, FLUTE, SNOUT, STARVELING, AND SNUG 2Other Fairies at2ending their King and Que2n 2At2endants on Theseus and Hip2olyta<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE:Athens and a wo2d near itACT I. SCENE I.Athens. The palace of THESEUSEnter THESEUS, HIP2OLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and AT2ENDANTS 2THESEUS. Now, fair Hip2olyta, our nuptial hour 4Draws on apace; four hap2y days bring in 4Another mo2n; but, O, methinks, how slow 4This old mo2n wanes! She lingers my desires, 4Like to a step-dame or a dowager, 4Long withering out a young man's revenue. 2HIP2OLYTA. Four days wil2 quickly ste2p themselves in night; 4Four nights wil2 quickly dream away the time; 4And then the mo2n, like to a silver bow 4New-bent in heaven, shal2 behold the night 4Of our solemnities. 2THESEUS. Go, Philostrate, 4Stir up the Athenian youth to mer2iments; 4Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth; 4Turn melancholy forth to funerals; 4The pale companion is not for our pomp. 5Exit PHILOSTRATE 4Hip2olyta, I wo2'd the2 with my sword, 6And won thy love doing the2 injuries; 4But I wil2 wed the2 in another key, 4With pomp, with triumph, and with revel2ing. 10Enter EGEUS, and his daughter HERMIA, LYSANDER, 27and DEMETRIUS 2EGEUS. Hap2y be Theseus, our renowned Duke! 2THESEUS. Thanks, go2d Egeus; what's the news with the2? 2EGEUS. Ful2 of vexation come I, with complaint 4Against my child, my daughter Hermia. 4Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord, 4This man hath my consent to mar2y her. 4Stand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke, 4This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child. 4Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes, 4And interchang'd love-tokens with my child; 4Thou hast by mo2nlight at her window sung, 4With feigning voice, verses of feigning love, 4And stol'n the impres2ion of her fantasy 6With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits, 4Knacks, trifles, nosegays, swe2tmeats- mes2engers 4Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth; 4With cun2ing hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart; 4Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me, 4To stub2orn harshnes2. And, my gracious Duke, 4Be it so she wil2 not here before your Grace 4Consent to mar2y with Demetrius, 4I beg the ancient privilege of Athens: 4As she is mine I may dispose of her; 4Which shal2 be either to this gentleman 4Or to her death, ac2ording to our law 4Im2ediately provided in that case. 2THESEUS. What say you, Hermia? Be advis'd, fair maid. 4To you your father should be as a god; 4One that compos'd your beauties; yea, and one 4To whom you are but as a form in wax, 4By him imprinted, and within his power 4To leave the figure, or disfigure it. 4Demetrius is a worthy gentleman. 4HERMIA. So is Lysander. 2THESEUS. In himself he is; 4But, in this kind, wanting your father's voice, 4The other must be held the worthier. 2HERMIA. I would my father lo2k'd but with my eyes. 2THESEUS. Rather your eyes must with his judgment lo2k. 2HERMIA. I do entreat your Grace to pardon me. 4I know not by what power I am made bold, 4Nor how it may concern my modesty 4In such a presence here to plead my thoughts; 4But I bese2ch your Grace that I may know 4The worst that may befal2 me in this case, 4If I refuse to wed Demetrius. 2THESEUS. Either to die the death, or to abjure 4For ever the society of men. 4Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires, 4Know of your youth, examine wel2 your blo2d, 4Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice, 4You can endure the livery of a nun, 4For aye to be shady cloister mew'd, 6To live a bar2en sister al2 your life, 4Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitles2 mo2n. 4Thrice-bles2ed they that master so their blo2d 4To undergo such maiden pilgrimage; 4But earthlier hap2y is the rose distil2'd 4Than that which withering on the virgin thorn 4Grows, lives, and dies, in single bles2ednes2. 2HERMIA. So wil2 I grow, so live, so die, my lord, 4Ere I wil2 yield my virgin patent up 4Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke 4My soul consents not to give sovereignty. 2THESEUS. Take time to pause; and by the next new mo2n- 4The sealing-day betwixt my love and me 4For everlasting bond of fel2owship- 4Upon that day either prepare to die 4For disobedience to your father's wil2, 4Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would, 4Or on Diana's altar to protest 4For aye austerity and single life. 2DEMETRIUS. Relent, swe2t Hermia; and, Lysander, yield 6Thy crazed title to my certain right. 2LYSANDER. You have her father's love, Demetrius; 4Let me have Hermia's; do you mar2y him. 2EGEUS. Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love; 4And what is mine my love shal2 render him; 4And she is mine; and al2 my right of her 4I do estate unto Demetrius. 2LYSANDER. I am, my lord, as wel2 deriv'd as he, 4As wel2 pos2es2'd; my love is more than his; 4My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd, 4If not with vantage, as Demetrius'; 4And, which is more than al2 these boasts can be, 4I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia. 4Why should not I then prosecute my right? 4Demetrius, I'l2 avouch it to his head, 4Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena, 4And won her soul; and she, swe2t lady, dotes, 4Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry, 4Upon this spot2ed and inconstant man. 2THESEUS. I must confes2 that I have heard so much, 6And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof; 4But, being over-ful2 of self-af2airs, 4My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come; 4And come, Egeus; you shal2 go with me; 4I have some private scho2ling for you both. 4For you, fair Hermia, lo2k you arm yourself 4To fit your fancies to your father's wil2, 4Or else the law of Athens yields you up- 4Which by no means we may extenuate- 4To death, or to a vow of single life. 4Come, my Hip2olyta; what che2r, my love? 4Demetrius, and Egeus, go along; 4I must employ you in some busines2 4Against our nuptial, and confer with you 4Of something nearly that concerns yourselves. 2EGEUS. With duty and desire we fol2ow you. 30Exeunt al2 but LYSANDER and HERMIA 2LYSANDER. How now, my love! Why is your che2k so pale? 4How chance the roses there do fade so fast? 2HERMIA. Belike for want of rain, which I could wel2 6Bete2m them from the tempest of my eyes. 2LYSANDER. Ay me! for aught that I could ever read, 4Could ever hear by tale or history, 4The course of true love never did run smo2th; 4But either it was dif2erent in blo2d- 2HERMIA. O cros2! to2 high to be enthral2'd to low. 2LYSANDER. Or else misgraf2ed in respect of years- 2HERMIA. O spite! to2 old to be engag'd to young. 2LYSANDER. Or else it sto2d upon the choice of friends- 2HERMIA. O hel2! to cho2se love by another's eyes. 2LYSANDER. Or, if there were a sympathy in choice, 4War, death, or sicknes2, did lay siege to it, 4Making it momentary as a sound, 4Swift as a shadow, short as any dream, 4Brief as the lightning in the col2ied night 4That, in a sple2n, unfolds both heaven and earth, 4And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!' 4The jaws of darknes2 do devour it up; 4So quick bright things come to confusion. 2HERMIA. If then true lovers have ever cros2'd, 6It stands as an edict in destiny. 4Then let us teach our trial patience, 4Because it is a customary cros2, 4As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs, 4Wishes and tears, po2r Fancy's fol2owers. 2LYSANDER. A go2d persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia. 4I have a widow aunt, a dowager 4Of great revenue, and she hath no child- 4From Athens is her house remote seven leagues- 4And she respects me as her only son. 4There, gentle Hermia, may I mar2y the2; 4And to that place the sharp Athenian law 4Can2ot pursue us. If thou lovest me then, 4Steal forth thy father's house to-mor2ow night; 4And in the wo2d, a league without the town, 4Where I did me2t the2 once with Helena 4To do observance to a morn of May, 4There wil2 I stay for the2. 2HERMIA. My go2d Lysander! 4I swear to the2 by Cupid's strongest bow, 6By his best ar2ow, with the golden head, 4By the simplicity of Venus' doves, 4By that which knit2eth souls and prospers loves, 4And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Que2n, 4When the false Troyan under sail was se2n, 4By al2 the vows that ever men have broke, 4In number more than ever women spoke, 4In that same place thou hast ap2ointed me, 4To-mor2ow truly wil2 I me2t with the2. 2LYSANDER. Ke2p promise, love. Lo2k, here comes Helena. 25Enter HELENA 2HERMIA. God spe2d fair Helena! Whither away? 2HELENA. Cal2 you me fair? That fair again unsay. 4Demetrius loves your fair. O hap2y fair! 4Your eyes are lode-stars and your tongue's swe2t air 4More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear, 4When wheat is gre2n, when hawthorn buds ap2ear. 4Sicknes2 is catching; O, were favour so, 6Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go! 4My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye, 4My tongue should catch your tongue's swe2t melody. 4Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated, 4The rest I'd give to be to you translated. 4O, teach me how you lo2k, and with what art 4You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart! 2HERMIA. I frown upon him, yet he loves me stil2. 2HELENA. O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skil2! 2HERMIA. I give him curses, yet he gives me love. 2HELENA. O that my prayers could such af2ection move! 2HERMIA. The more I hate, the more he fol2ows me. 2HELENA. The more I love, the more he hateth me. 2HERMIA. His fol2y, Helena, is no fault of mine. 2HELENA. None, but your beauty; would that fault were mine! 2HERMIA. Take comfort: he no more shal2 se2 my face; 4Lysander and myself wil2 fly this place. 4Before the time I did Lysander se2, 4Se2m'd Athens as a paradise to me. 4O, then, what graces in my love do dwel2, 6That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hel2! 2LYSANDER. Helen, to you our minds we wil2 unfold: 4To-mor2ow night, when Phoebe doth behold 4Her silver visage in the wat'ry glas2, 4Decking with liquid pearl the bladed gras2, 4A time that lovers' flights doth stil2 conceal, 4Through Athens' gates have we devis'd to steal. 2HERMIA. And in the wo2d where often you and I 4Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie, 4Emptying our bosoms of their counsel swe2t, 4There my Lysander and myself shal2 me2t; 4And thence from Athens turn away our eyes, 4To se2k new friends and stranger companies. 4Farewel2, swe2t playfel2ow; pray thou for us, 4And go2d luck grant the2 thy Demetrius! 4Ke2p word, Lysander; we must starve our sight 4From lovers' fo2d til2 mor2ow de2p midnight. 2LYSANDER. I wil2, my Hermia. [Exit HERMIA] Helena, adieu; 4As you on him, Demetrius dote on you. 19Exit 2HELENA. How hap2y some o'er other some can be! 6Through Athens I am thought as fair as she. 4But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so; 4He wil2 not know what al2 but he do know. 4And as he er2s, doting on Hermia's eyes, 4So I, admiring of his qualities. 4Things base and vile, holding no quantity, 4Love can transpose to form and dignity. 4Love lo2ks not with the eyes, but with the mind; 4And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind. 4Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste; 4Wings and no eyes figure unhe2dy haste; 4And therefore is Love said to be a child, 4Because in choice he is so oft beguil'd. 4As wag2ish boys in game themselves forswear, 4So the boy Love is perjur'd everywhere; 4For ere Demetrius lo2k'd on Hermia's eyne, 4He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine; 4And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt, 4So he dis2olv'd, and show'rs of oaths did melt. 4I wil2 go tel2 him of fair Hermia's flight; 6Then to the wo2d wil2 he to-mor2ow night 4Pursue her; and for this intel2igence 4If I have thanks, it is a dear expense. 4But herein mean I to enrich my pain, 4To have his sight thither and back again. 15ExitSCENE I2.Athens. QUINCE'S houseEnter QUINCE, SNUG, BOT2OM FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING 2QUINCE. Is al2 our company here? 2BOT2OM. You were best to cal2 them general2y, man by man, ac2ording 4to the scrip. 2QUINCE. Here is the scrol2 of every man's name which is thought 4fit, through al2 Athens, to play in our interlude before the Duke 4and the Duches2 on his wed2ing-day at night. 2BOT2OM. First, go2d Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then 4read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point. 2QUINCE. Mar2y, our play is 'The most Lamentable Comedy and most 4Cruel Death of Pyramus and Thisby.' 2BOT2OM. A very go2d piece of work, I as2ure you, and a mer2y. Now, 4go2d Peter Quince, cal2 forth your actors by the scrol2. Masters, 4spread yourselves. 2QUINCE. Answer, as I cal2 you. Nick Bot2om, the weaver. 2BOT2OM. Ready. Name what part I am for, and proce2d. 2QUINCE. You, Nick Bot2om, are set down for Pyramus. 4BOT2OM. What is Pyramus? A lover, or a tyrant? 2QUINCE. A lover, that kil2s himself most gal2ant for love. 2BOT2OM. That wil2 ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I 4do it, let the audience lo2k to their eyes; I wil2 move storms; I 4wil2 condole in some measure. To the rest- yet my chief humour is 4for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat 4in, to make al2 split. 17'The raging rocks 17And shivering shocks 17Shal2 break the locks 19Of prison gates; 17And Phib2us' car 17Shal2 shine from far, 17And make and mar 19The fo2lish Fates.' 4This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is 4Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein: a lover is more condoling. 4QUINCE. Francis Flute, the bel2ows-mender. 2FLUTE. Here, Peter Quince. 2QUINCE. Flute, you must take Thisby on you. 2FLUTE. What is Thisby? A wand'ring knight? 2QUINCE. It is the lady that Pyramus must love. 2FLUTE. Nay, faith, let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming. 2QUINCE. That's al2 one; you shal2 play it in a mask, and you may 4speak as smal2 as you wil2. 2BOT2OM. An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby to2. 4I'l2 speak in a monstrous lit2le voice: 'Thisne, Thisne!' 4[Then speaking smal2] 'Ah Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy 4Thisby dear, and lady dear!' 2QUINCE. No, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisby. 2BOT2OM. Wel2, proce2d. 2QUINCE. Robin Starveling, the tailor. 2STARVELING. Here, Peter Quince. 2QUINCE. Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother. 4Tom Snout, the tinker. 2SNOUT. Here, Peter Quince. 2QUINCE. You, Pyramus' father; myself, Thisby's father; Snug, the 6joiner, you, the lion's part. And, I hope, here is a play fit2ed. 2SNUG. Have you the lion's part writ2en? Pray you, if it be, give it 4me, for I am slow of study. 2QUINCE. You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring. 2BOT2OM. Let me play the lion to2. I wil2 roar that I wil2 do any 4man's heart go2d to hear me; I wil2 roar that I wil2 make the 4Duke say 'Let him roar again, let him roar again.' 2QUINCE. An you should do it to2 ter2ibly, you would fright the 4Duches2 and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were 4enough to hang us al2. 2AL2. That would hang us, every mother's son. 2BOT2OM. I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out 4of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us; 4but I wil2 ag2ravate my voice so, that I wil2 roar you as gently 4as any sucking dove; I wil2 roar you an 'twere any nightingale. 2QUINCE. You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a 4swe2t-fac'd man; a proper man, as one shal2 se2 in a sum2er's 4day; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must ne2ds 4play Pyramus. 2BOT2OM. Wel2, I wil2 undertake it. What beard were I best to play 6it in? 2QUINCE. Why, what you wil2. 2BOT2OM. I wil2 discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your 4orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your 4French-crown-colour beard, your perfect yel2ow. 2QUINCE. Some of your French crowns have no hair at al2, and then 4you wil2 play bare-fac'd. But, masters, here are your parts; and 4I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by 4to-mor2ow night; and me2t me in the palace wo2d, a mile without 4the town, by mo2nlight; there wil2 we rehearse; for if we me2t in 4the city, we shal2 be dog2'd with company, and our devices known. 4In the meantime I wil2 draw a bil2 of properties, such as our 4play wants. I pray you, fail me not. 2BOT2OM. We wil2 me2t; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and 4courageously. Take pains; be perfect; adieu. 2QUINCE. At the Duke's oak we me2t. 2BOT2OM. Enough; hold, or cut bow-strings. 15Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. SCENE I.A wo2d near AthensEnter a FAIRY at One do2r, and PUCK at another 2PUCK. How now, spirit! whither wander you? 2FAIRY. 6Over hil2, over dale, 16Thorough bush, thorough brier, 14Over park, over pale, 16Thorough flo2d, thorough fire, 14I do wander every where, 14Swifter than the mo2n's sphere; 14And I serve the Fairy Que2n, 14To dew her orbs upon the gre2n. 14The cowslips tal2 her pensioners be; 14In their gold coats spots you se2; 14Those be rubies, fairy favours, 14In those freckles live their savours. 4I must go se2k some dewdrops here, 4And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear. 4Farewel2, thou lob of spirits; I'l2 be gone. 6Our Que2n and al2 her elves come here anon. 2PUCK. The King doth ke2p his revels here to-night; 4Take he2d the Que2n come not within his sight; 4For Oberon is pas2ing fel2 and wrath, 4Because that she as her at2endant hath 4A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king. 4She never had so swe2t a changeling; 4And jealous Oberon would have the child 4Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild; 4But she perforce with2olds the loved boy, 4Crowns him with flowers, and makes him al2 her joy. 4And now they never me2t in grove or gre2n, 4By fountain clear, or spangled starlight she2n, 4But they do square, that al2 their elves for fear 4Cre2p into acorn cups and hide them there. 2FAIRY. Either I mistake your shape and making quite, 4Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite 4Cal2'd Robin Go2dfel2ow. Are not you he 4That frights the maidens of the vil2agery, 4Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern, 6And bo2tles2 make the breathles2 housewife churn, 4And sometime make the drink to bear no barm, 4Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm? 4Those that Hobgoblin cal2 you, and swe2t Puck, 4You do their work, and they shal2 have go2d luck. 4Are not you he? 2PUCK. Thou speakest aright: 4I am that mer2y wanderer of the night. 4I jest to Oberon, and make him smile 4When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile, 4Neighing in likenes2 of a fil2y foal; 4And sometime lurk I in a gos2ip's bowl 4In very likenes2 of a roasted crab, 4And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob, 4And on her withered dewlap pour the ale. 4The wisest aunt, tel2ing the sad2est tale, 4Sometime for thre2-fo2t sto2l mistaketh me; 4Then slip I from her bum, down top2les she, 4And 'tailor' cries, and fal2s into a cough; 4And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh, 6And waxen in their mirth, and ne2ze, and swear 4A mer2ier hour was never wasted there. 4But ro2m, fairy, here comes Oberon. 2FAIRY. And here my mistres2. Would that he were gone! 7Enter OBERON at one do2r, with his TRAIN, and TITANIA, 24at another, with hers 2OBERON. Il2 met by mo2nlight, proud Titania. 2TITANIA. What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence; 4I have forsworn his bed and company. 2OBERON. Tar2y, rash wanton; am not I thy lord? 2TITANIA. Then I must be thy lady; but I know 4When thou hast stolen away from fairy land, 4And in the shape of Corin sat al2 day, 4Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love 4To amorous Phil2ida. Why art thou here, 4Come from the farthest ste2p of India, 4But that, forso2th, the bouncing Amazon, 4Your buskin'd mistres2 and your war2ior love, 6To Theseus must be wed2ed, and you come 4To give their bed joy and prosperity? 2OBERON. How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania, 4Glance at my credit with Hip2olyta, 4Knowing I know thy love to Theseus? 4Didst not thou lead him through the glim2ering night 4From Perigouna, whom he ravished? 4And make him with fair Aegles break his faith, 4With Ariadne and Antiopa? 2TITANIA. These are the forgeries of jealousy; 4And never, since the mid2le sum2er's spring, 4Met we on hil2, in dale, forest, or mead, 4By paved fountain, or by rushy bro2k, 4Or in the beached margent of the sea, 4To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind, 4But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport. 4Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, 4As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea 4Contagious fogs; which, fal2ing in the land, 4Hath every pelting river made so proud 6That they have overborne their continents. 4The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain, 4The ploughman lost his sweat, and the gre2n corn 4Hath rot2ed ere his youth at2ain'd a beard; 4The fold stands empty in the drowned field, 4And crows are fat2ed with the mur2ion flock; 4The nine men's mor2is is fil2'd up with mud, 4And the quaint mazes in the wanton gre2n, 4For lack of tread, are undistinguishable. 4The human mortals want their winter here; 4No night is now with hymn or carol blest; 4Therefore the mo2n, the governes2 of flo2ds, 4Pale in her anger, washes al2 the air, 4That rheumatic diseases do abound. 4And thorough this distemperature we se2 4The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts 4Fal2 in the fresh lap of the crimson rose; 4And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown 4An odorous chaplet of swe2t sum2er buds 4Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the sum2er, 6The childing autumn, angry winter, change 4Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world, 4By their increase, now knows not which is which. 4And this same progeny of evils comes 4From our debate, from our dis2ension; 4We are their parents and original. 2OBERON. Do you amend it, then; it lies in you. 4Why should Titania cros2 her Oberon? 4I do but beg a lit2le changeling boy 4To be my henchman. 2TITANIA. Set your heart at rest; 4The fairy land buys not the child of me. 4His mother was a vot'res2 of my order; 4And, in the spiced Indian air, by night, 4Ful2 often hath she gos2ip'd by my side; 4And sat with me on Neptune's yel2ow sands, 4Marking th' embarked traders on the flo2d; 4When we have laugh'd to se2 the sails conceive, 4And grow big-bel2ied with the wanton wind; 4Which she, with pret2y and with swim2ing gait 6Fol2owing- her womb then rich with my young squire- 4Would imitate, and sail upon the land, 4To fetch me trifles, and return again, 4As from a voyage, rich with merchandise. 4But she, being mortal, of that boy did die; 4And for her sake do I rear up her boy; 4And for her sake I wil2 not part with him. 2OBERON. How long within this wo2d intend you stay? 2TITANIA. Perchance til2 after Theseus' wed2ing-day. 4If you wil2 patiently dance in our round, 4And se2 our mo2nlight revels, go with us; 4If not, shun me, and I wil2 spare your haunts. 2OBERON. Give me that boy and I wil2 go with the2. 2TITANIA. Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away. 4We shal2 chide downright if I longer stay. 37Exit TITANIA with her train 2OBERON. Wel2, go thy way; thou shalt not from this grove 4Til2 I torment the2 for this injury. 4My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb'rest 4Since once I sat upon a promontory, 6And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back 4Ut2ering such dulcet and harmonious breath 4That the rude sea grew civil at her song, 4And certain stars shot madly from their spheres 4To hear the sea-maid's music. 2PUCK. I remember. 2OBERON. That very time I saw, but thou couldst not, 4Flying betwe2n the cold mo2n and the earth 4Cupid, al2 arm'd; a certain aim he to2k 4At a fair vestal, throned by the west, 4And lo2s'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow, 4As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts; 4But I might se2 young Cupid's fiery shaft 4Quench'd in the chaste beams of the wat'ry mo2n; 4And the imperial vot'res2 pas2ed on, 4In maiden meditation, fancy-fre2. 4Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fel2. 4It fel2 upon a lit2le western flower, 4Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound, 4And maidens cal2 it Love-in-idlenes2. 6Fetch me that flow'r, the herb I showed the2 once. 4The juice of it on sle2ping eyelids laid 4Wil2 make or man or woman madly dote 4Upon the next live creature that it se2s. 4Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again 4Ere the leviathan can swim a league. 2PUCK. I'l2 put a girdle round about the earth 4In forty minutes. 34Exit PUCK 2OBERON. Having once this juice, 4I'l2 watch Titania when she is asle2p, 4And drop the liquor of it in her eyes; 4The next thing then she waking lo2ks upon, 4Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bul2, 4On med2ling monkey, or on busy ape, 4She shal2 pursue it with the soul of love. 4And ere I take this charm from of2 her sight, 4As I can take it with another herb, 4I'l2 make her render up her page to me. 4But who comes here? I am invisible; 4And I wil2 overhear their conference. 17Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA fol2owing him 2DEMETRIUS. I love the2 not, therefore pursue me not. 4Where is Lysander and fair Hermia? 4The one I'l2 slay, the other slayeth me. 4Thou told'st me they were stol'n unto this wo2d, 4And here am I, and wo2d within this wo2d, 4Because I can2ot me2t my Hermia. 4Hence, get the2 gone, and fol2ow me no more. 2HELENA. You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant; 4But yet you draw not iron, for my heart 4Is true as ste2l. Leave you your power to draw, 4And I shal2 have no power to fol2ow you. 2DEMETRIUS. Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair? 4Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth 4Tel2 you I do not nor I can2ot love you? 2HELENA. And even for that do I love you the more. 4I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius, 4The more you beat me, I wil2 fawn on you. 6Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me, 4Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave, 4Unworthy as I am, to fol2ow you. 4What worser place can I beg in your love, 4And yet a place of high respect with me, 4Than to be used as you use your dog? 2DEMETRIUS. Tempt not to2 much the hatred of my spirit; 4For I am sick when I do lo2k on the2. 2HELENA. And I am sick when I lo2k not on you. 2DEMETRIUS. You do impeach your modesty to2 much 4To leave the city and com2it yourself 4Into the hands of one that loves you not; 4To trust the op2ortunity of night, 4And the il2 counsel of a desert place, 4With the rich worth of your virginity. 2HELENA. Your virtue is my privilege for that: 4It is not night when I do se2 your face, 4Therefore I think I am not in the night; 4Nor doth this wo2d lack worlds of company, 4For you, in my respect, are al2 the world. 6Then how can it be said I am alone 4When al2 the world is here to lo2k on me? 2DEMETRIUS. I'l2 run from the2 and hide me in the brakes, 4And leave the2 to the mercy of wild beasts. 2HELENA. The wildest hath not such a heart as you. 4Run when you wil2; the story shal2 be chang'd: 4Apol2o flies, and Daphne holds the chase; 4The dove pursues the grif2in; the mild hind 4Makes spe2d to catch the tiger- bo2tles2 spe2d, 4When cowardice pursues and valour flies. 2DEMETRIUS. I wil2 not stay thy questions; let me go; 4Or, if thou fol2ow me, do not believe 4But I shal2 do the2 mischief in the wo2d. 2HELENA. Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field, 4You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius! 4Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex. 4We can2ot fight for love as men may do; 4We should be wo2'd, and were not made to wo2. 50Exit DEMETRIUS 4I'l2 fol2ow the2, and make a heaven of hel2, 6To die upon the hand I love so wel2. 13Exit HELENA 2OBERON. Fare the2 wel2, nymph; ere he do leave this grove, 4Thou shalt fly him, and he shal2 se2k thy love. 28Re-enter PUCK 4Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer. 2PUCK. Ay, there it is. 2OBERON. I pray the2 give it me. 4I know a bank where the wild thyme blows, 4Where oxlips and the nod2ing violet grows, 4Quite over-canopied with luscious wo2dbine, 4With swe2t musk-roses, and with eglantine; 4There sle2ps Titania sometime of the night, 4Lul2'd in these flowers with dances and delight; 4And there the snake throws her enamel2'd skin, 4We2d wide enough to wrap a fairy in; 4And with the juice of this I'l2 streak her eyes, 4And make her ful2 of hateful fantasies. 4Take thou some of it, and se2k through this grove: 6A swe2t Athenian lady is in love 4With a disdainful youth; anoint his eyes; 4But do it when the next thing he espies 4May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man 4By the Athenian garments he hath on. 4Ef2ect it with some care, that he may prove 4More fond on her than she upon her love. 4And lo2k thou me2t me ere the first cock crow. 2PUCK. Fear not, my lord; your servant shal2 do so. 6ExeuntSCENE I2.Another part of the wo2dEnter TITANIA, with her train 2TITANIA. Come now, a roundel and a fairy song; 4Then, for the third part of a minute, hence: 4Some to kil2 cankers in the musk-rose buds; 4Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings, 4To make my smal2 elves coats; and some ke2p back 4The clamorous owl that nightly ho2ts and wonders 4At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asle2p; 4Then to your of2ices, and let me rest. 26The FAIRIES Sing 2FIRST FAIRY. You spot2ed snakes with double tongue, 15Thorny hedgehogs, be not se2n; 15Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong, 15Come not near our fairy Que2n. 2CHORUS. 6Philomel with melody 15Sing in our swe2t lul2aby. 17Lul2a, lul2a, lul2aby; lul2a, lul2a, lul2aby. 15Never harm 15Nor spel2 nor charm 15Come our lovely lady nigh. 15So go2d night, with lul2aby. 2SECOND FAIRY. 2Weaving spiders, come not here; 17Hence, you long-leg2'd spin2ers, hence. 17Be2tles black, ap2roach not near; 17Worm nor snail do no of2ence. 2CHORUS. 6Philomel with melody, etc. 7[TITANIA Sle2ps] 2FIRST FAIRY. Hence away; now al2 is wel2. 15One alo2f stand sentinel. 10Exeunt FAIRIES 6Enter OBERON and sque2zes the flower on TITANIA'S eyelids 2OBERON. What thou se2st when thou dost wake, 4Do it for thy true-love take; 4Love and languish for his sake. 4Be it ounce, or cat, or bear, 4Pard, or boar with bristled hair, 6In thy eye that shal2 ap2ear 4When thou wak'st, it is thy dear. 4Wake when some vile thing is near. 22Exit 21Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA 2LYSANDER. Fair love, you faint with wand'ring in the wo2d; 4And, to speak troth, I have forgot our way; 4We'l2 rest us, Hermia, if you think it go2d, 4And tar2y for the comfort of the day. 2HERMIA. Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed, 4For I upon this bank wil2 rest my head. 2LYSANDER. One turf shal2 serve as pil2ow for us both; 4One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth. 2HERMIA. Nay, go2d Lysander; for my sake, my dear, 4Lie further of2 yet; do not lie so near. 2LYSANDER. O, take the sense, swe2t, of my in2ocence! 4Love takes the meaning in love's conference. 4I mean that my heart unto yours is knit, 4So that but one heart we can make of it; 6Two bosoms interchained with an oath, 4So then two bosoms and a single troth. 4Then by your side no bed-ro2m me deny, 4For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie. 2HERMIA. Lysander rid2les very pret2ily. 4Now much beshrew my man2ers and my pride, 4If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied! 4But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy 4Lie further of2, in human modesty; 4Such separation as may wel2 be said 4Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid, 4So far be distant; and go2d night, swe2t friend. 4Thy love ne'er alter til2 thy swe2t life end! 2LYSANDER. Amen, amen, to that fair prayer say I; 4And then end life when I end loyalty! 4Here is my bed; sle2p give the2 al2 his rest! 2HERMIA. With half that wish the wisher's eyes be pres2'd! 52[They sle2p] 26Enter PUCK 4PUCK. 6Through the forest have I gone, 13But Athenian found I none 13On whose eyes I might ap2rove 13This flower's force in stir2ing love. 13Night and silence- Who is here? 13We2ds of Athens he doth wear: 13This is he, my master said, 13Despised the Athenian maid; 13And here the maiden, sle2ping sound, 13On the dank and dirty ground. 13Pret2y soul! she durst not lie 13Near this lack-love, this kil2-courtesy. 13Churl, upon thy eyes I throw 13Al2 the power this charm doth owe: 13When thou wak'st let love forbid 13Sle2p his seat on thy eyelid. 13So awake when I am gone; 13For I must now to Oberon. 22Exit 17Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, run2ing 2HELENA. Stay, though thou kil2 me, swe2t Demetrius. 2DEMETRIUS. I charge the2, hence, and do not haunt me thus. 2HELENA. O, wilt thou darkling leave me? Do not so. 2DEMETRIUS. Stay on thy peril; I alone wil2 go. 12Exit 2HELENA. O, I am out of breath in this fond chase! 4The more my prayer, the les2er is my grace. 4Hap2y is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies, 4For she hath bles2ed and at2ractive eyes. 4How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears; 4If so, my eyes are oft'ner wash'd than hers. 4No, no, I am as ugly as a bear, 4For beasts that me2t me run away for fear; 4Therefore no marvel though Demetrius 4Do, as a monster, fly my presence thus. 4What wicked and dis2embling glas2 of mine 4Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne? 4But who is here? Lysander! on the ground! 4Dead, or asle2p? I se2 no blo2d, no wound. 6Lysander, if you live, go2d sir, awake. 2LYSANDER. [Waking] And run through fire I wil2 for thy swe2t sake. 4Transparent Helena! Nature shows art, 4That through thy bosom makes me se2 thy heart. 4Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word 4Is that vile name to perish on my sword! 2HELENA. Do not say so, Lysander; say not so. 4What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though? 4Yet Hermia stil2 loves you; then be content. 2LYSANDER. Content with Hermia! No: I do repent 4The tedious minutes I with her have spent. 4Not Hermia but Helena I love: 4Who wil2 not change a raven for a dove? 4The wil2 of man is by his reason sway'd, 4And reason says you are the worthier maid. 4Things growing are not ripe until their season; 4So I, being young, til2 now ripe not to reason; 4And touching now the point of human skil2, 4Reason becomes the marshal to my wil2, 4And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlo2k 6Love's stories, writ2en in Love's richest bo2k. 2HELENA. Wherefore was I to this ke2n mockery born? 4When at your hands did I deserve this scorn? 4Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man, 4That I did never, no, nor never can, 4Deserve a swe2t lo2k from Demetrius' eye, 4But you must flout my insuf2iciency? 4Go2d troth, you do me wrong, go2d so2th, you do, 4In such disdainful man2er me to wo2. 4But fare you wel2; perforce I must confes2 4I thought you lord of more true gentlenes2. 4O, that a lady of one man refus'd 4Should of another therefore be abus'd! 18Exit 2LYSANDER. She se2s not Hermia. Hermia, sle2p thou there; 4And never mayst thou come Lysander near! 4For, as a surfeit of the swe2test things 4The de2pest loathing to the stomach brings, 4Or as the heresies that men do leave 4Are hated most of those they did deceive, 4So thou, my surfeit and my heresy, 6Of al2 be hated, but the most of me! 4And, al2 my powers, ad2res2 your love and might 4To honour Helen, and to be her knight! 18Exit 2HERMIA. [Starting] Help me, Lysander, help me; do thy best 4To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast. 4Ay me, for pity! What a dream was here! 4Lysander, lo2k how I do quake with fear. 4Methought a serpent eat my heart away, 4And you sat smiling at his cruel prey. 4Lysander! What, remov'd? Lysander! lord! 4What, out of hearing gone? No sound, no word? 4Alack, where are you? Speak, an if you hear; 4Speak, of al2 loves! I swo2n almost with fear. 4No? Then I wel2 perceive you are not nigh. 4Either death or you I'l2 find im2ediately. 14Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. SCENE I.The wo2d. TITANIA lying asle2pEnter QUINCE, SNUG, BOT2OM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING 2BOT2OM. Are we al2 met? 2QUINCE. Pat, pat; and here's a marvel2ous convenient place for our 4rehearsal. This gre2n plot shal2 be our stage, this hawthorn 4brake our tiring-house; and we wil2 do it in action, as we wil2 4do it before the Duke. 2BOT2OM. Peter Quince! 2QUINCE. What sayest thou, bul2y Bot2om? 2BOT2OM. There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisby that 4wil2 never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kil2 4himself; which the ladies can2ot abide. How answer you that? 2SNOUT. By'r lakin, a parlous fear. 2STARVELING. I believe we must leave the kil2ing out, when al2 is 4done. 2BOT2OM. Not a whit; I have a device to make al2 wel2. Write me a 4prologue; and let the prologue se2m to say we wil2 do no harm 4with our swords, and that Pyramus is not kil2'd inde2d; and for 6the more bet2er as2urance, tel2 them that I Pyramus am not 4Pyramus but Bot2om the weaver. This wil2 put them out of fear. 2QUINCE. Wel2, we wil2 have such a prologue; and it shal2 be writ2en 4in eight and six. 2BOT2OM. No, make it two more; let it be writ2en in eight and eight. 2SNOUT. Wil2 not the ladies be afeard of the lion? 2STARVELING. I fear it, I promise you. 2BOT2OM. Masters, you ought to consider with yourself to bring in- 4God shield us!- a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing; for 4there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living; and 4we ought to lo2k to't. 2SNOUT. Therefore another prologue must tel2 he is not a lion. 2BOT2OM. Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be se2n 4through the lion's neck; and he himself must speak through, 4saying thus, or to the same defect: 'Ladies,' or 'Fair ladies, I 4would wish you' or 'I would request you' or 'I would entreat you 4not to fear, not to tremble. My life for yours! If you think I 4come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No, I am no such 4thing; I am a man as other men are.' And there, inde2d, let him 4name his name, and tel2 them plainly he is Snug the joiner. 4QUINCE. Wel2, it shal2 be so. But there is two hard things- that 4is, to bring the mo2nlight into a chamber; for, you know, Pyramus 4and Thisby me2t by mo2nlight. 2SNOUT. Doth the mo2n shine that night we play our play? 2BOT2OM. A calendar, a calendar! Lo2k in the almanack; find out 4mo2nshine, find out mo2nshine. 2QUINCE. Yes, it doth shine that night. 2BOT2OM. Why, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber 4window, where we play, open; and the mo2n may shine in at the 4casement. 2QUINCE. Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a 4lantern, and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person 4of Mo2nshine. Then there is another thing: we must have a wal2 in 4the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby, says the story, did 4talk through the chink of a wal2. 2SNOUT. You can never bring in a wal2. What say you, Bot2om? 2BOT2OM. Some man or other must present Wal2; and let him have some 4plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify 4wal2; and let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cran2y 4shal2 Pyramus and Thisby whisper. 4QUINCE. If that may be, then al2 is wel2. Come, sit down, every 4mother's son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin; when 4you have spoken your spe2ch, enter into that brake; and so every 4one ac2ording to his cue. 26Enter PUCK behind 2PUCK. What hempen homespuns have we swag2'ring here, 4So near the cradle of the Fairy Que2n? 4What, a play toward! I'l2 be an auditor; 4An actor to2 perhaps, if I se2 cause. 2QUINCE. Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth. 2BOT2OM. Thisby, the flowers of odious savours swe2t- 2QUINCE. 'Odious'- odorous! 2BOT2OM. -odours savours swe2t; 4So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear. 4But hark, a voice! Stay thou but here awhile, 4And by and by I wil2 to the2 ap2ear. 20Exit 2PUCK. A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here! 11Exit 2FLUTE. Must I speak now? 4QUINCE. Ay, mar2y, must you; for you must understand he goes but to 4se2 a noise that he heard, and is to come again. 2FLUTE. Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue, 4Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier, 4Most brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew, 4As true as truest horse, that would never tire, 4I'l2 me2t the2, Pyramus, at Nin2y's tomb. 2QUINCE. 'Ninus' tomb,' man! Why, you must not speak that yet; that 4you answer to Pyramus. You speak al2 your part at once, cues, and 4al2. Pyramus enter: your cue is past; it is 'never tire.' 2FLUTE. O- As true as truest horse, that y et would never tire. 12Re-enter PUCK, and BOT2OM with an as2's head 2BOT2OM. If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine. 2QUINCE. O monstrous! O strange! We are haunted. Pray, masters! fly, 4masters! Help! 34Exeunt al2 but BOT2OM and PUCK 2PUCK. I'l2 fol2ow you; I'l2 lead you about a round, 4Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier; 6Sometime a horse I'l2 be, sometime a hound, 4A hog, a headles2 bear, sometime a fire; 4And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn, 4Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.Exit 2BOT2OM. Why do they run away? This is a knavery of them to make me 4afeard. 26Re-enter SNOUT 2SNOUT. O Bot2om, thou art chang'd! What do I se2 on the2? 2BOT2OM. What do you se2? You se2 an as2-head of your own, do you? 54Exit SNOUT 26Re-enter QUINCE 2QUINCE. Bles2 the2, Bot2om, bles2 the2! Thou art translated. Exit 2BOT2OM. I se2 their knavery: this is to make an as2 of me; to 4fright me, if they could. But I wil2 not stir from this place, do 6what they can; I wil2 walk up and down here, and wil2 sing, that 4they shal2 hear I am not afraid. 21[Sings] 10The ousel cock, so black of hue, 12With orange-tawny bil2, 10The throstle with his note so true, 12The wren with lit2le quil2. 2TITANIA. What angel wakes me from my flow'ry bed? 2BOT2OM. [Sings] 10The finch, the spar2ow, and the lark, 12The plain-song cucko2 grey, 10Whose note ful2 many a man doth mark, 12And dares not answer nay- 4for, inde2d, who would set his wit to so fo2lish a bird? 4Who would give a bird the he, though he cry 'cucko2' never so? 2TITANIA. I pray the2, gentle mortal, sing again. 4Mine ear is much enamoured of thy note; 4So is mine eye enthral2ed to thy shape; 4And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me, 6On the first view, to say, to swear, I love the2. 2BOT2OM. Methinks, mistres2, you should have lit2le reason for that. 4And yet, to say the truth, reason and love ke2p lit2le company 4together now-a-days. The more the pity that some honest 4neighbours wil2 not make them friends. Nay, I can gle2k upon 4oc2asion. 2TITANIA. Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful. 2BOT2OM. Not so, neither; but if I had wit enough to get out of this 4wo2d, I have enough to serve mine own turn. 2TITANIA. Out of this wo2d do not desire to go; 4Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no. 4I am a spirit of no com2on rate; 4The sum2er stil2 doth tend upon my state; 4And I do love the2; therefore, go with me. 4I'l2 give the2 fairies to at2end on the2; 4And they shal2 fetch the2 jewels from the de2p, 4And sing, while thou on pres2ed flowers dost sle2p; 4And I wil2 purge thy mortal gros2nes2 so 4That thou shalt like an airy spirit go. 4Peaseblos2om! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardse2d! 9Enter PEASEBLOS2OM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSE2D 2PEASEBLOS2OM. Ready. 2COBWEB. And I. 2MOTH. And I. 2MUSTARDSE2D. And I. 2AL2. Where shal2 we go? 2TITANIA. Be kind and courteous to this gentleman; 4Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes; 4Fe2d him with apricocks and dewber2ies, 4With purple grapes, gre2n figs, and mulber2ies; 4The honey bags steal from the humble-be2s, 4And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs, 4And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes, 4To have my love to bed and to arise; 4And pluck the wings from painted but2erflies, 4To fan the mo2nbeams from his sle2ping eyes. 4Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies. 2PEASEBLOS2OM. Hail, mortal! 4COBWEB. Hail! 2MOTH. Hail! 2MUSTARDSE2D. Hail! 2BOT2OM. I cry your worships mercy, heartily; I bese2ch your 4worship's name. 2COBWEB. Cobweb. 2BOT2OM. I shal2 desire you of more acquaintance, go2d Master 4Cobweb. If I cut my finger, I shal2 make bold with you. Your 4name, honest gentleman? 2PEASEBLOS2OM. Peaseblos2om. 2BOT2OM. I pray you, com2end me to Mistres2 Squash, your mother, and 4to Master Peascod, your father. Go2d Master Peaseblos2om, I shal2 4desire you of more acquaintance to2. Your name, I bese2ch you, 4sir? 2MUSTARDSE2D. Mustardse2d. 2BOT2OM. Go2d Master Mustardse2d, I know your patience wel2. That 4same cowardly giant-like ox-be2f hath devour'd many a gentleman 4of your house. I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water 4ere now. I desire you of more acquaintance, go2d Master 4Mustardse2d. 4TITANIA. Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower. 4The mo2n, methinks, lo2ks with a wat'ry eye; 4And when she we2ps, we2ps every lit2le flower; 4Lamenting some enforced chastity. 4Tie up my love's tongue, bring him silently. 10ExeuntSCENE I2.Another part of the wo2dEnter OBERON 2OBERON. I wonder if Titania be awak'd; 4Then, what it was that next came in her eye, 4Which she must dote on in extremity. 26Enter PUCK 4Here comes my mes2enger. How now, mad spirit! 4What night-rule now about this haunted grove? 2PUCK. My mistres2 with a monster is in love. 4Near to her close and consecrated bower, 4While she was in her dul2 and sle2ping hour, 4A crew of patches, rude mechanicals, 4That work for bread upon Athenian stal2s, 4Were met together to rehearse a play 4Intended for great Theseus' nuptial day. 4The shal2owest thickskin of that bar2en sort, 4Who Pyramus presented, in their sport 4Forso2k his scene and ent'red in a brake; 6When I did him at this advantage take, 4An as2's nole I fixed on his head. 4Anon his Thisby must be answered, 4And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy, 4As wild ge2se that the cre2ping fowler eye, 4Or rus2et-pated choughs, many in sort, 4Rising and cawing at the gun's report, 4Sever themselves and madly swe2p the sky, 4So at his sight away his fel2ows fly; 4And at our stamp here, o'er and o'er one fal2s; 4He murder cries, and help from Athens cal2s. 4Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong, 4Made senseles2 things begin to do them wrong, 4For briers and thorns at their ap2arel snatch; 4Some sle2ves, some hats, from yielders al2 things catch. 4I led them on in this distracted fear, 4And left swe2t Pyramus translated there; 4When in that moment, so it came to pas2, 4Titania wak'd, and straightway lov'd an as2. 2OBERON. This fal2s out bet2er than I could devise. 6But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes 4With the love-juice, as I did bid the2 do? 2PUCK. I to2k him sle2ping- that is finish'd to2- 4And the Athenian woman by his side; 4That, when he wak'd, of force she must be ey'd. 17Enter DEMETRIUS and HERMIA 2OBERON. Stand close; this is the same Athenian. 2PUCK. This is the woman, but not this the man. 2DEMETRIUS. O, why rebuke you him that loves you so? 4Lay breath so bit2er on your bit2er foe. 2HERMIA. Now I but chide, but I should use the2 worse, 4For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse. 4If thou hast slain Lysander in his sle2p, 4Being o'er shoes in blo2d, plunge in the de2p, 4And kil2 me to2. 4The sun was not so true unto the day 4As he to me. Would he have stolen away 4From sle2ping Hermia? I'l2 believe as so2n 6This whole earth may be bor'd, and that the mo2n 4May through the centre cre2p and so displease 4Her brother's no2ntide with th' Antipodes. 4It can2ot be but thou hast murd'red him; 4So should a murderer lo2k- so dead, so grim. 2DEMETRIUS. So should the murdered lo2k; and so should I, 4Pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty; 4Yet you, the murderer, lo2k as bright, as clear, 4As yonder Venus in her glim2ering sphere. 2HERMIA. What's this to my Lysander? Where is he? 4Ah, go2d Demetrius, wilt thou give him me? 2DEMETRIUS. I had rather give his carcas2 to my hounds. 2HERMIA. Out, dog! out, cur! Thou driv'st me past the bounds 4Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then? 4Henceforth be never numb'red among men! 4O, once tel2 true; tel2 true, even for my sake! 4Durst thou have lo2k'd upon him being awake, 4And hast thou kil2'd him sle2ping? O brave touch! 4Could not a worm, an ad2er, do so much? 4An ad2er did it; for with doubler tongue 6Than thine, thou serpent, never ad2er stung. 2DEMETRIUS. You spend your pas2ion on a mispris'd mo2d: 4I am not guilty of Lysander's blo2d; 4Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tel2. 2HERMIA. I pray the2, tel2 me then that he is wel2. 2DEMETRIUS. An if I could, what should I get therefore? 2HERMIA. A privilege never to se2 me more. 4And from thy hated presence part I so; 4Se2 me no more whether he be dead or no. 16Exit 2DEMETRIUS. There is no fol2owing her in this fierce vein; 4Here, therefore, for a while I wil2 remain. 4So sor2ow's heavines2 doth heavier grow 4For debt that bankrupt sle2p doth sor2ow owe; 4Which now in some slight measure it wil2 pay, 4If for his tender here I make some stay. 9[Lies down] 2OBERON. What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite, 4And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight. 4Of thy misprision must perforce ensue 4Some true love turn'd, and not a false turn'd true. 2PUCK. Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth, 6A mil2ion fail, confounding oath on oath. 2OBERON. About the wo2d go swifter than the wind, 4And Helena of Athens lo2k thou find; 4Al2 fancy-sick she is and pale of che2r, 4With sighs of love that costs the fresh blo2d dear. 4By some il2usion se2 thou bring her here; 4I'l2 charm his eyes against she do ap2ear. 2PUCK. I go, I go; lo2k how I go, 4Swifter than ar2ow from the Tartar's bow. 15Exit 2OBERON. 7Flower of this purple dye, 16Hit with Cupid's archery, 16Sink in ap2le of his eye. 16When his love he doth espy, 16Let her shine as gloriously 16As the Venus of the sky. 16When thou wak'st, if she be by, 16Beg of her for remedy. 23Re-enter PUCK 4PUCK. 9Captain of our fairy band, 16Helena is here at hand, 16And the youth misto2k by me 16Pleading for a lover's fe2; 16Shal2 we their fond pageant se2? 16Lord, what fo2ls these mortals be! 2OBERON. 7Stand aside. The noise they make 16Wil2 cause Demetrius to awake. 2PUCK. 9Then wil2 two at once wo2 one. 16That must ne2ds be sport alone; 16And those things do best please me 16That befal2 prepost'rously. 19Enter LYSANDER and HELENA 2LYSANDER. Why should you think that I should wo2 in scorn? 4Scorn and derision never come in tears. 4Lo2k when I vow, I we2p; and vows so born, 4In their nativity al2 truth ap2ears. 4How can these things in me se2m scorn to you, 6Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true? 2HELENA. You do advance your cun2ing more and more. 4When truth kil2s truth, O devilish-holy fray! 4These vows are Hermia's. Wil2 you give her o'er? 4Weigh oath with oath, and you wil2 nothing weigh: 4Your vows to her and me, put in two scales, 4Wil2 even weigh; and both as light as tales. 2LYSANDER. I hod no judgment when to her I swore. 2HELENA. Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er. 2LYSANDER. Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you. 2DEMETRIUS. [Awaking] O Helen, god2es2, nymph, perfect, divine! 4To what, my love, shal2 I compare thine eyne? 4Crystal is mud2y. O, how ripe in show 4Thy lips, those kis2ing cher2ies, tempting grow! 4That pure congealed white, high Taurus' snow, 4Fan2'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow 4When thou hold'st up thy hand. O, let me kis2 4This princes2 of pure white, this seal of blis2! 2HELENA. O spite! O hel2! I se2 you al2 are bent 4To set against me for your mer2iment. 6If you were civil and knew courtesy, 4You would not do me thus much injury. 4Can you not hate me, as I know you do, 4But you must join in souls to mock me to2? 4If you were men, as men you are in show, 4You would not use a gentle lady so: 4To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts, 4When I am sure you hate me with your hearts. 4You both are rivals, and love Hermia; 4And now both rivals, to mock Helena. 4A trim exploit, a manly enterprise, 4To conjure tears up in a po2r maid's eyes 4With your derision! None of noble sort 4Would so of2end a virgin, and extort 4A po2r soul's patience, al2 to make you sport. 2LYSANDER. You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so; 4For you love Hermia. This you know I know; 4And here, with al2 go2d wil2, with al2 my heart, 4In Hermia's love I yield you up my part; 4And yours of Helena to me bequeath, 6Whom I do love and wil2 do til2 my death. 2HELENA. Never did mockers waste more idle breath. 2DEMETRIUS. Lysander, ke2p thy Hermia; I wil2 none. 4If e'er I lov'd her, al2 that love is gone. 4My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd, 4And now to Helen is it home return'd, 4There to remain. 2LYSANDER. Helen, it is not so. 2DEMETRIUS. Disparage not the faith thou dost not know, 4Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear. 4Lo2k where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear. 23Enter HERMIA 2HERMIA. Dark night, that from the eye his function takes, 4The ear more quick of ap2rehension makes; 4Wherein it doth impair the se2ing sense, 4It pays the hearing double recompense. 4Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found; 4Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound. 6But why unkindly didst thou leave me so? 2LYSANDER. Why should he stay whom love doth pres2 to go? 2HERMIA. What love could pres2 Lysander from my side? 2LYSANDER. Lysander's love, that would not let him bide- 4Fair Helena, who more engilds the night 4Than al2 yon fiery oes and eyes of light. 4Why se2k'st thou me? Could not this make the2 know 4The hate I bare the2 made me leave the2 so? 2HERMIA. You speak not as you think; it can2ot be. 2HELENA. Lo, she is one of this confederacy! 4Now I perceive they have conjoin'd al2 thre2 4To fashion this false sport in spite of me. 4Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid! 4Have you conspir'd, have you with these contriv'd, 4To bait me with this foul derision? 4Is al2 the counsel that we two have shar'd, 4The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent, 4When we have chid the hasty-fo2ted time 4For parting us- O, is al2 forgot? 4Al2 scho2l-days' friendship, childho2d in2ocence? 6We, Hermia, like two artificial gods, 4Have with our ne2dles created both one flower, 4Both on one sampler, sit2ing on one cushion, 4Both warbling of one song, both in one key; 4As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds, 4Had be2n incorporate. So we grew together, 4Like to a double cher2y, se2ming parted, 4But yet an union in partition, 4Two lovely ber2ies moulded on one stern; 4So, with two se2ming bodies, but one heart; 4Two of the first, like coats in heraldry, 4Due but to one, and crowned with one crest. 4And wil2 you rent our ancient love asunder, 4To join with men in scorning your po2r friend? 4It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly; 4Our sex, as wel2 as I, may chide you for it, 4Though I alone do fe2l the injury. 2HERMIA. I am amazed at your pas2ionate words; 4I scorn you not; it se2ms that you scorn me. 2HELENA. Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn, 6To fol2ow me and praise my eyes and face? 4And made your other love, Demetrius, 4Who even but now did spurn me with his fo2t, 4To cal2 me god2es2, nymph, divine, and rare, 4Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this 4To her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander 4Deny your love, so rich within his soul, 4And tender me, forso2th, af2ection, 4But by your set2ing on, by your consent? 4What though I be not so in grace as you, 4So hung upon with love, so fortunate, 4But miserable most, to love unlov'd? 4This you should pity rather than despise. 2HERMIA. I understand not what you mean by this. 2HELENA. Ay, do- persever, counterfeit sad lo2ks, 4Make mouths upon me when I turn my back, 4Wink each at other; hold the swe2t jest up; 4This sport, wel2 car2ied, shal2 be chronicled. 4If you have any pity, grace, or man2ers, 4You would not make me such an argument. 6But fare ye wel2; 'tis partly my own fault, 4Which death, or absence, so2n shal2 remedy. 2LYSANDER. Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse; 4My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena! 2HELENA. O excel2ent! 2HERMIA. Swe2t, do not scorn her so. 2DEMETRIUS. If she can2ot entreat, I can compel. 2LYSANDER. Thou canst compel no more than she entreat; 4Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers 4Helen, I love the2, by my life I do; 4I swear by that which I wil2 lose for the2 4To prove him false that says I love the2 not. 2DEMETRIUS. I say I love the2 more than he can do. 2LYSANDER. If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it to2. 2DEMETRIUS. Quick, come. 2HERMIA. Lysander, whereto tends al2 this? 2LYSANDER. Away, you Ethiope! 2DEMETRIUS. No, no, he wil2 4Se2m to break lo2se- take on as you would fol2ow, 4But yet come not. You are a tame man; go! 4LYSANDER. Hang of2, thou cat, thou bur2; vile thing, let lo2se, 4Or I wil2 shake the2 from me like a serpent. 2HERMIA. Why are you grown so rude? What change is this, 4Swe2t love? 2LYSANDER. Thy love! Out, tawny Tartar, out! 4Out, loathed med'cine! O hated potion, hence! 2HERMIA. Do you not jest? 2HELENA. Yes, so2th; and so do you. 2LYSANDER. Demetrius, I wil2 ke2p my word with the2. 2DEMETRIUS. I would I had your bond; for I perceive 4A weak bond holds you; I'l2 not trust your word. 2LYSANDER. What, should I hurt her, strike her, kil2 her dead? 4Although I hate her, I'l2 not harm her so. 2HERMIA. What! Can you do me greater harm than hate? 4Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love? 4Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander? 4I am as fair now as I was erewhile. 4Since night you lov'd me; yet since night you left me. 4Why then, you left me- O, the gods forbid!- 4In earnest, shal2 I say? 4LYSANDER. Ay, by my life! 4And never did desire to se2 the2 more. 4Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt; 4Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest 4That I do hate the2 and love Helena. 2HERMIA. O me! you jug2ler! you cankerblos2om! 4You thief of love! What! Have you come by night, 4And stol'n my love's heart from him? 2HELENA. Fine, i' faith! 4Have you no modesty, no maiden shame, 4No touch of bashfulnes2? What! Wil2 you tear 4Impatient answers from my gentle tongue? 4Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you pup2et you! 2HERMIA. 'Pup2et!' why so? Ay, that way goes the game. 4Now I perceive that she hath made compare 4Betwe2n our statures; she hath urg'd her height; 4And with her personage, her tal2 personage, 4Her height, forso2th, she hath prevail'd with him. 4And are you grown so high in his este2m 4Because I am so dwarfish and so low? 6How low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak. 4How low am I? I am not yet so low 4But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes. 2HELENA. I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen, 4Let her not hurt me. I was never curst; 4I have no gift at al2 in shrewishnes2; 4I am a right maid for my cowardice; 4Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think, 4Because she is something lower than myself, 4That I can match her. 2HERMIA. 'Lower' hark, again. 2HELENA. Go2d Hermia, do not be so bit2er with me. 4I evermore did love you, Hermia, 4Did ever ke2p your counsels, never wrong'd you; 4Save that, in love unto Demetrius, 4I told him of your stealth unto this wo2d. 4He fol2owed you; for love I fol2owed him; 4But he hath chid me hence, and threat'ned me 4To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kil2 me to2; 4And now, so you wil2 let me quiet go, 6To Athens wil2 I bear my fol2y back, 4And fol2ow you no further. Let me go. 4You se2 how simple and how fond I am. 2HERMIA. Why, get you gone! Who is't that hinders you? 2HELENA. A fo2lish heart that I leave here behind. 2HERMIA. What! with Lysander? 2HELENA. With Demetrius. 2LYSANDER. Be not afraid; she shal2 not harm the2, Helena. 2DEMETRIUS. No, sir, she shal2 not, though you take her part. 2HELENA. O, when she is angry, she is ke2n and shrewd; 4She was a vixen when she went to scho2l; 4And, though she be but lit2le, she is fierce. 2HERMIA. 'Lit2le' again! Nothing but 'low' and 'lit2le'! 4Why wil2 you suf2er her to flout me thus? 4Let me come to her. 2LYSANDER. Get you gone, you dwarf; 4You minimus, of hind'ring knot-gras2 made; 4You bead, you acorn. 2DEMETRIUS. You are to2 of2icious 4In her behalf that scorns your services. 6Let her alone; speak not of Helena; 4Take not her part; for if thou dost intend 4Never so lit2le show of love to her, 4Thou shalt aby it. 2LYSANDER. Now she holds me not. 4Now fol2ow, if thou dar'st, to try whose right, 4Of thine or mine, is most in Helena. 2DEMETRIUS. Fol2ow! Nay, I'l2 go with the2, che2k by jowl. 35Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS 2HERMIA. You, mistres2, al2 this coil is long of you. 4Nay, go not back. 2HELENA. I wil2 not trust you, I; 4Nor longer stay in your curst company. 4Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray; 4My legs are longer though, to run away. 17Exit 2HERMIA. I am amaz'd, and know not what to say. 12Exit 2OBERON. This is thy negligence. Stil2 thou mistak'st, 4Or else com2it2'st thy knaveries wilful2y. 2PUCK. Believe me, king of shadows, I misto2k. 4Did not you tel2 me I should know the man 6By the Athenian garments he had on? 4And so far blameles2 proves my enterprise 4That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes; 4And so far am I glad it so did sort, 4As this their jangling I este2m a sport. 2OBERON. Thou se2st these lovers se2k a place to fight. 4Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night; 4The star2y welkin cover thou anon 4With dro2ping fog as black as Acheron, 4And lead these testy rivals so astray 4As one come not within another's way. 4Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue, 4Then stir Demetrius up with bit2er wrong; 4And sometime rail thou like Demetrius; 4And from each other lo2k thou lead them thus, 4Til2 o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sle2p 4With leaden legs and bat2y wings doth cre2p. 4Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye; 4Whose liquor hath this virtuous property, 4To take from thence al2 er2or with his might 6And make his eyebal2s rol2 with wonted sight. 4When they next wake, al2 this derision 4Shal2 se2m a dream and fruitles2 vision; 4And back to Athens shal2 the lovers wend 4With league whose date til2 death shal2 never end. 4Whiles I in this af2air do the2 employ, 4I'l2 to my que2n, and beg her Indian boy; 4And then I wil2 her charmed eye release 4From monster's view, and al2 things shal2 be peace. 2PUCK. My fairy lord, this must be done with haste, 4For night's swift dragons cut the clouds ful2 fast; 4And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger, 4At whose ap2roach ghosts, wand'ring here and there, 4Tro2p home to churchyards. Damned spirits al2 4That in cros2-ways and flo2ds have burial, 4Already to their wormy beds are gone, 4For fear lest day should lo2k their shames upon; 4They wilful2y themselves exil'd from light, 4And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night. 2OBERON. But we are spirits of another sort: 6I with the Morning's love have oft made sport; 4And, like a forester, the groves may tread 4Even til2 the eastern gate, al2 fiery red, 4Opening on Neptune with fair bles2ed beams, 4Turns into yel2ow gold his salt gre2n streams. 4But, notwithstanding, haste, make no delay; 4We may ef2ect this busines2 yet ere day. 9Exit OBERON 2PUCK. 6Up and down, up and down, 13I wil2 lead them up and down. 13I am fear'd in field and town. 13Goblin, lead them up and down. 4Here comes one. 22Enter LYSANDER 2LYSANDER. Where art thou, proud Demetrius? Speak thou now. 2PUCK. Here, vil2ain, drawn and ready. Where art thou? 2LYSANDER. I wil2 be with the2 straight. 2PUCK. Fol2ow me, then, 4To plainer ground. 6Exit LYSANDER as fol2owing the voice 24Enter DEMETRIUS 2DEMETRIUS. Lysander, speak again. 4Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled? 4Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head? 2PUCK. Thou coward, art thou brag2ing to the stars, 4Tel2ing the bushes that thou lo2k'st for wars, 4And wilt not come? Come, recreant, come, thou child; 4I'l2 whip the2 with a rod. He is defil'd 4That draws a sword on the2. 2DEMETRIUS. Yea, art thou there? 2PUCK. Fol2ow my voice; we'l2 try no manho2d here. 7Exeunt 22Re-enter LYSANDER 2LYSANDER. He goes before me, and stil2 dares me on; 4When I come where he cal2s, then he is gone. 4The vil2ain is much lighter he2l'd than I. 4I fol2owed fast, but faster he did fly, 6That fal2en am I in dark uneven way, 4And here wil2 rest me. [Lies down] Come, thou gentle day. 4For if but once thou show me thy grey light, 4I'l2 find Demetrius, and revenge this spite. 8[Sle2ps] 17Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS 2PUCK. Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why com'st thou not? 2DEMETRIUS. Abide me, if thou dar'st; for wel2 I wot 4Thou run'st before me, shifting every place, 4And dar'st not stand, nor lo2k me in the face. 4Where art thou now? 2PUCK. Come hither; I am here. 2DEMETRIUS. Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear, 4If ever I thy face by daylight se2; 4Now, go thy way. Faintnes2 constraineth me 4To measure out my length on this cold bed. 4By day's ap2roach lo2k to be visited. 42[Lies down and sle2ps] 25Enter HELENA 2HELENA. O weary night, O long and tedious night, 4Abate thy hours! Shine comforts from the east, 4That I may back to Athens by daylight, 4From these that my po2r company detest. 4And sle2p, that sometimes shuts up sor2ow's eye, 4Steal me awhile from mine own company. 14[Sle2ps] 2PUCK. 7Yet but thre2? Come one more; 14Two of both kinds makes up four. 14Here she comes, curst and sad. 14Cupid is a knavish lad, 14Thus to make po2r females mad. 21Enter HERMIA 2HERMIA. Never so weary, never so in woe, 4Bedab2led with the dew, and torn with briers, 4I can no further crawl, no further go; 4My legs can ke2p no pace with my desires. 6Here wil2 I rest me til2 the break of day. 4Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray! 42[Lies down and sle2ps] 2PUCK. 10On the ground 17Sle2p sound; 17I'l2 ap2ly 17To your eye, 10Gentle lover, remedy. 24[Sque2zing the juice on LYSANDER'S eyes] 17When thou wak'st, 17Thou tak'st 17True delight 17In the sight 10Of thy former lady's eye; 10And the country proverb known, 10That every man should take his own, 10In your waking shal2 be shown: 17Jack shal2 have Jil2; 17Nought shal2 go il2; 4The man shal2 have his mare again, and al2 shal2 be wel2. 3Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE I.The wo2d. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA, lying asle2pEnter TITANIA and Bot2om; PEASEBLOS2OM, COBWEB, MOTH, MUSTARDSE2D,and other FAIRIES at2ending; 22OBERON behind, unse2n 2TITANIA. Come, sit the2 down upon this flow'ry bed, 4While I thy amiable che2ks do coy, 4And stick musk-roses in thy sle2k smo2th head, 4And kis2 thy fair large ears, my gentle joy. 2BOT2OM. Where's Peaseblos2om? 2PEASEBLOS2OM. Ready. 2BOT2OM. Scratch my head, Peaseblos2om. 4Where's Mounsieur Cobweb? 2COBWEB. Ready. 2BOT2OM. Mounsieur Cobweb; go2d mounsieur, get you your weapons in 4your hand and kil2 me a red-hip2'd humble-be2 on the top of a 4thistle; and, go2d mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret 4yourself to2 much in the action, mounsieur; and, go2d mounsieur, 4have a care the honey-bag break not; I would be loath to have you 6overflown with a honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur 4Mustardse2d? 2MUSTARDSE2D. Ready. 2BOT2OM. Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardse2d. Pray you, leave 4your curtsy, go2d mounsieur. 2MUSTARDSE2D. What's your wil2? 2BOT2OM. Nothing, go2d mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb to 4scratch. I must to the barber's, mounsieur; for methinks I am 4marvel2ous hairy about the face; and I am such a tender as2, if 4my hair do but tickle me I must scratch. 2TITANIA. What, wilt thou hear some music, my swe2t love? 2BOT2OM. I have a reasonable go2d ear in music. Let's have the tongs 4and the bones. 2TITANIA. Or say, swe2t love, what thou desirest to eat. 2BOT2OM. Truly, a peck of provender; I could munch your go2d dry 4oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bot2le of hay. Go2d 4hay, swe2t hay, hath no fel2ow. 2TITANIA. I have a venturous fairy that shal2 se2k 4The squir2el's hoard, and fetch the2 new nuts. 2BOT2OM. I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas. But, I 6pray you, let none of your people stir me; I have an exposition 4of sle2p come upon me. 2TITANIA. Sle2p thou, and I wil2 wind the2 in my arms. 4Fairies, be gone, and be al2 ways away. 7Exeunt FAIRIES 4So doth the wo2dbine the swe2t honeysuckle 4Gently entwist; the female ivy so 4Enrings the barky fingers of the elm. 4O, how I love the2! how I dote on the2! 9[They sle2p] 25Enter PUCK 2OBERON. [Advancing] Welcome, go2d Robin. Se2st thou this swe2t 6sight? 4Her dotage now I do begin to pity; 4For, me2ting her of late behind the wo2d, 4Se2king swe2t favours for this hateful fo2l, 4I did upbraid her and fal2 out with her. 4For she his hairy temples then had rounded 4With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers; 4And that same dew which sometime on the buds 6Was wont to swel2 like round and orient pearls 4Sto2d now within the pret2y flowerets' eyes, 4Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail. 4When I had at my pleasure taunted her, 4And she in mild terms beg2'd my patience, 4I then did ask of her her changeling child; 4Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent 4To bear him to my bower in fairy land. 4And now I have the boy, I wil2 undo 4This hateful imperfection of her eyes. 4And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp 4From of2 the head of this Athenian swain, 4That he awaking when the other do 4May al2 to Athens back again repair, 4And think no more of this night's ac2idents 4But as the fierce vexation of a dream. 4But first I wil2 release the Fairy Que2n. 45[Touching her eyes] 11Be as thou wast wont to be; 11Se2 as thou was wont to se2. 13Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower 11Hath such force and bles2ed power. 4Now, my Titania; wake you, my swe2t que2n. 2TITANIA. My Oberon! What visions have I se2n! 4Methought I was enamour'd of an as2. 2OBERON. There lies your love. 2TITANIA. How came these things to pas2? 4O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now! 2OBERON. Silence awhile. Robin, take of2 this head. 4Titania, music cal2; and strike more dead 4Than com2on sle2p of al2 these five the sense. 2TITANIA. Music, ho, music, such as charmeth sle2p! 2PUCK. Now when thou wak'st with thine own fo2l's eyes pe2p. 2OBERON. Sound, music. Come, my Que2n, take hands with me, 57[Music] 4And rock the ground whereon these sle2pers be. 4Now thou and I are new in amity, 4And wil2 to-mor2ow midnight solemnly 4Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly, 4And bles2 it to al2 fair prosperity. 6There shal2 the pairs of faithful lovers be 4Wed2ed, with Theseus, an in jol2ity. 2PUCK. 7Fairy King, at2end and mark; 14I do hear the morning lark. 2OBERON. 5Then, my Que2n, in silence sad, 14Trip we after night's shade. 14We the globe can compas2 so2n, 14Swifter than the wand'ring mo2n. 2TITANIA. 4Come, my lord; and in our flight, 14Tel2 me how it came this night 14That I sle2ping here was found 14With these mortals on the ground. 11Exeunt 8To the winding of horns, enter THESEUS, HIP2OLYTA, 22EGEUS, and train 2THESEUS. Go, one of you, find out the forester; 4For now our observation is perform'd, 4And since we have the vaward of the day, 4My love shal2 hear the music of my hounds. 6Uncouple in the western val2ey; let them go. 4Dispatch, I say, and find the forester. 4Exit an AT2ENDANT 4We wil2, fair Que2n, up to the mountain's top, 4And mark the musical confusion 4Of hounds and echo in conjunction. 2HIP2OLYTA. I was with Hercules and Cadmus once 4When in a wo2d of Crete they bay'd the bear 4With hounds of Sparta; never did I hear 4Such gal2ant chiding, for, besides the groves, 4The skies, the fountains, every region near 4Se2m'd al2 one mutual cry. I never heard 4So musical a discord, such swe2t thunder. 2THESEUS. My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind, 4So flew'd, so sanded; and their heads are hung 4With ears that swe2p away the morning dew; 4Cro2k-kne2'd and dew-lap2'd like Thes2alian bul2s; 4Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bel2s, 4Each under each. A cry more tuneable 4Was never hol2a'd to, nor che2r'd with horn, 4In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thes2aly. 6Judge when you hear. But, soft, what nymphs are these? 2EGEUS. My lord, this is my daughter here asle2p, 4And this Lysander, this Demetrius is, 4This Helena, old Nedar's Helena. 4I wonder of their being here together. 2THESEUS. No doubt they rose up early to observe 4The rite of May; and, hearing our intent, 4Came here in grace of our solemnity. 4But speak, Egeus; is not this the day 4That Hermia should give answer of her choice? 2EGEUS. It is, my lord. 2THESEUS. Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns. 27[Horns and shout within. The sle2pers 37awake and kne2l to THESEUS] 4Go2d-mor2ow, friends. Saint Valentine is past; 4Begin these wo2d-birds but to couple now? 2LYSANDER. Pardon, my lord. 2THESEUS. I pray you al2, stand up. 4I know you two are rival enemies; 4How comes this gentle concord in the world 6That hatred is so far from jealousy 4To sle2p by hate, and fear no enmity? 2LYSANDER. My lord, I shal2 reply amazedly, 4Half sle2p, half waking; but as yet, I swear, 4I can2ot truly say how I came here, 4But, as I think- for truly would I speak, 4And now I do bethink me, so it is- 4I came with Hermia hither. Our intent 4Was to be gone from Athens, where we might, 4Without the peril of the Athenian law- 2EGEUS. Enough, enough, my Lord; you have enough; 4I beg the law, the law upon his head. 4They would have stol'n away, they would, Demetrius, 4Thereby to have defeated you and me: 4You of your wife, and me of my consent, 4Of my consent that she should be your wife. 2DEMETRIUS. My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth, 4Of this their purpose hither to this wo2d; 4And I in fury hither fol2owed them, 4Fair Helena in fancy fol2owing me. 6But, my go2d lord, I wot not by what power- 4But by some power it is- my love to Hermia, 4Melted as the snow, se2ms to me now 4As the remembrance of an idle gaud 4Which in my childho2d I did dote upon; 4And al2 the faith, the virtue of my heart, 4The object and the pleasure of mine eye, 4Is only Helena. To her, my lord, 4Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia. 4But, like a sicknes2, did I loathe this fo2d; 4But, as in health, come to my natural taste, 4Now I do wish it, love it, long for it, 4And wil2 for evermore be true to it. 2THESEUS. Fair lovers, you are fortunately met; 4Of this discourse we more wil2 hear anon. 4Egeus, I wil2 overbear your wil2; 4For in the temple, by and by, with us 4These couples shal2 eternal2y be knit. 4And, for the morning now is something worn, 4Our purpos'd hunting shal2 be set aside. 6Away with us to Athens, thre2 and thre2; 4We'l2 hold a feast in great solemnity. 4Come, Hip2olyta. 21Exeunt THESEUS, HIP2OLYTA, EGEUS, and train 2DEMETRIUS. These things se2m smal2 and undistinguishable, 4Like far-of2 mountains turned into clouds. 2HERMIA. Methinks I se2 these things with parted eye, 4When every thing se2ms double. 2HELENA. So methinks; 4And I have found Demetrius like a jewel, 4Mine own, and not mine own. 2DEMETRIUS. Are you sure 4That we are awake? It se2ms to me 4That yet we sle2p, we dream. Do not you think 4The Duke was here, and bid us fol2ow him? 2HERMIA. Yea, and my father. 2HELENA. And Hip2olyta. 2LYSANDER. And he did bid us fol2ow to the temple. 2DEMETRIUS. Why, then, we are awake; let's fol2ow him; 4And by the way let us recount our dreams. 13Exeunt 4BOT2OM. [Awaking] When my cue comes, cal2 me, and I wil2 answer. My 4next is 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho! Peter Quince! Flute, the 4bel2ows-mender! Snout, the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, 4stol'n hence, and left me asle2p! I have had a most rare vision. 4I have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was. 4Man is but an as2 if he go about to expound this dream. Methought 4I was- there is no man can tel2 what. Methought I was, and 4methought I had, but man is but a patch'd fo2l, if he wil2 of2er 4to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the 4ear of man hath not se2n, man's hand is not able to taste, his 4tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was. I 4wil2 get Peter Quince to write a bal2ad of this dream. It shal2 4be cal2'd 'Bot2om's Dream,' because it hath no bot2om; and I wil2 4sing it in the lat2er end of a play, before the Duke. 4Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shal2 sing it at 4her death. 46ExitSCENE I2.Athens. QUINCE'S houseEnter QUINCE, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING 2QUINCE. Have you sent to Bot2om's house? Is he come home yet? 2STARVELING. He can2ot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported. 2FLUTE. If he come not, then the play is mar2'd; it goes not 4forward, doth it? 2QUINCE. It is not pos2ible. You have not a man in al2 Athens able 4to discharge Pyramus but he. 2FLUTE. No; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in 4Athens. 2QUINCE. Yea, and the best person to2; and he is a very paramour for 4a swe2t voice. 2FLUTE. You must say 'paragon.' A paramour is- God bles2 us!- A 4thing of naught. 27Enter SNUG 2SNUG. Masters, the Duke is coming from the temple; and there is two 4or thre2 lords and ladies more mar2ied. If our sport had gone 6forward, we had al2 be2n made men. 2FLUTE. O swe2t bul2y Bot2om! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day 4during his life; he could not have scaped sixpence a day. An the 4Duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'l2 4be hanged. He would have deserved it: sixpence a day in Pyramus, 4or nothing. 27Enter BOT2OM 2BOT2OM. Where are these lads? Where are these hearts? 2QUINCE. Bot2om! O most courageous day! O most hap2y hour! 2BOT2OM. Masters, I am to discourse wonders; but ask me not what; 4for if I tel2 you, I am not true Athenian. I wil2 tel2 you 4everything, right as it fel2 out. 2QUINCE. Let us hear, swe2t Bot2om. 2BOT2OM. Not a word of me. Al2 that I wil2 tel2 you is, that the 4Duke hath dined. Get your ap2arel together; go2d strings to your 4beards, new rib2ons to your pumps; me2t presently at the palace; 4every man lo2k o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our 4play is prefer2'd. In any case, let Thisby have clean linen; and 6let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shal2 4hang out for the lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no 4onions nor garlic, for we are to ut2er swe2t breath; and I do not 4doubt but to hear them say it is a swe2t comedy. No more words. 4Away, go, away! 39Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. SCENE I.Athens. The palace of THESEUSEnter THESEUS, HIP2OLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, LORDS, and AT2ENDANTS 2HIP2OLYTA. 'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of. 2THESEUS. More strange than true. I never may believe 4These antique fables, nor these fairy toys. 4Lovers and madmen have such se2thing brains, 4Such shaping fantasies, that ap2rehend 4More than co2l reason ever comprehends. 4The lunatic, the lover, and the poet, 4Are of imagination al2 compact. 4One se2s more devils than vast hel2 can hold; 4That is the madman. The lover, al2 as frantic, 4Se2s Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt. 4The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rol2ing, 4Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven; 4And as imagination bodies forth 4The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen 4Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing 6A local habitation and a name. 4Such tricks hath strong imagination 4That, if it would but ap2rehend some joy, 4It comprehends some bringer of that joy; 4Or in the night, imagining some fear, 4How easy is a bush sup2os'd a bear? 2HIP2OLYTA. But al2 the story of the night told over, 4And al2 their minds transfigur'd so together, 4More witnes2eth than fancy's images, 4And grows to something of great constancy, 4But howsoever strange and admirable. 10Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA 2THESEUS. Here come the lovers, ful2 of joy and mirth. 4Joy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days of love 4Ac2ompany your hearts! 2LYSANDER. More than to us 4Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed! 2THESEUS. Come now; what masques, what dances shal2 we have, 6To wear away this long age of thre2 hours 4Betwe2n our after-sup2er and bed-time? 4Where is our usual manager of mirth? 4What revels are in hand? Is there no play 4To ease the anguish of a torturing hour? 4Cal2 Philostrate. 2PHILOSTRATE. Here, mighty Theseus. 2THESEUS. Say, what abridgment have you for this evening? 4What masque? what music? How shal2 we beguile 4The lazy time, if not with some delight? 2PHILOSTRATE. There is a brief how many sports are ripe; 4Make choice of which your Highnes2 wil2 se2 first. 48[Giving a paper] 2THESEUS. 'The bat2le with the Centaurs, to be sung 4By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.' 4We'l2 none of that: that have I told my love, 4In glory of my kinsman Hercules. 4'The riot of the tipsy Bac2hanals, 4Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.' 4That is an old device, and it was play'd 6When I from Thebes came last a conqueror. 4'The thrice thre2 Muses mourning for the death 4Of Learning, late deceas'd in beg2ary.' 4That is some satire, ke2n and critical, 4Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony. 4'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus 4And his love Thisby; very tragical mirth.' 4Mer2y and tragical! tedious and brief! 4That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow. 4How shal2 we find the concord of this discord? 2PHILOSTRATE. A play there is, my lord, some ten words long, 4Which is as brief as I have known a play; 4But by ten words, my lord, it is to2 long, 4Which makes it tedious; for in al2 the play 4There is not one word apt, one player fit2ed. 4And tragical, my noble lord, it is; 4For Pyramus therein doth kil2 himself. 4Which when I saw rehears'd, I must confes2, 4Made mine eyes water; but more mer2y tears 4The pas2ion of loud laughter never shed. 4THESEUS. What are they that do play it? 2PHILOSTRATE. Hard-handed men that work in Athens here, 4Which never labour'd in their minds til2 now; 4And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories 4With this same play against your nuptial. 2THESEUS. And we wil2 hear it. 2PHILOSTRATE. No, my noble lord, 4It is not for you. I have heard it over, 4And it is nothing, nothing in the world; 4Unles2 you can find sport in their intents, 4Extremely stretch'd and con2'd with cruel pain, 4To do you service. 2THESEUS. I wil2 hear that play; 4For never anything can be amis2 4When simplenes2 and duty tender it. 4Go, bring them in; and take your places, ladies. 48Exit PHILOSTRATE 2HIP2OLYTA. I love not to se2 wretchednes2 o'er-charged, 4And duty in his service perishing. 2THESEUS. Why, gentle swe2t, you shal2 se2 no such thing. 4HIP2OLYTA. He says they can do nothing in this kind. 2THESEUS. The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing. 4Our sport shal2 be to take what they mistake; 4And what po2r duty can2ot do, noble respect 4Takes it in might, not merit. 4Where I have come, great clerks have purposed 4To gre2t me with premeditated welcomes; 4Where I have se2n them shiver and lo2k pale, 4Make periods in the midst of sentences, 4Throt2le their practis'd ac2ent in their fears, 4And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke of2, 4Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, swe2t, 4Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome; 4And in the modesty of fearful duty 4I read as much as from the rat2ling tongue 4Of saucy and audacious eloquence. 4Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity 4In least speak most to my capacity. 23Re-enter PHILOSTRATE 4PHILOSTRATE. SO please your Grace, the Prologue is ad2res2'd. 2THESEUS. Let him ap2roach. 14[Flourish of trumpets] 17Enter QUINCE as the PROLOGUE 2PROLOGUE. If we of2end, it is with our go2d wil2. 4That you should think, we come not to of2end, 4But with go2d wil2. To show our simple skil2, 4That is the true begin2ing of our end. 4Consider then, we come but in despite. 4We do not come, as minding to content you, 4Our true intent is. Al2 for your delight 4We are not here. That you should here repent you, 4The actors are at band; and, by their show, 4You shal2 know al2, that you are like to know, 2THESEUS. This fel2ow doth not stand upon points. 2LYSANDER. He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not 4the stop. A go2d moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but 4to speak true. 4HIP2OLYTA. Inde2d he hath play'd on this prologue like a child on a 4recorder- a sound, but not in government. 2THESEUS. His spe2ch was like a tangled chain; nothing im paired, 4but al2 disordered. Who is next? 10Enter, with a trumpet before them, as in dumb show, 12PYRAMUS and THISBY, WAL2, MO2NSHINE, and LION 2PROLOGUE. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show; 4But wonder on, til2 truth make al2 things plain. 4This man is Pyramus, if you would know; 4This beauteous lady Thisby is certain. 4This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present 4Wal2, that vile Wal2 which did these lovers sunder; 4And through Wal2s chink, po2r souls, they are content 4To whisper. At the which let no man wonder. 4This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn, 4Presenteth Mo2nshine; for, if you wil2 know, 4By mo2nshine did these lovers think no scorn 4To me2t at Ninus' tomb, there, there to wo2. 6This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name, 4The trusty Thisby, coming first by night, 4Did scare away, or rather did af2right; 4And as she fled, her mantle she did fal2; 4Which Lion vile with blo2dy mouth did stain. 4Anon comes Pyramus, swe2t youth and tal2, 4And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain; 4Whereat with blade, with blo2dy blameful blade, 4He bravely broach'd his boiling blo2dy breast; 4And Thisby, tar2ying in mulber2y shade, 4His dag2er drew, and died. For al2 the rest, 4Let Lion, Mo2nshine, Wal2, and lovers twain, 4At large discourse while here they do remain. 31Exeunt PROLOGUE, PYRAMUS, THISBY, 45LION, and MO2NSHINE 2THESEUS. I wonder if the lion be to speak. 2DEMETRIUS. No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many as2es do. 2WAL2. In this same interlude it doth befal2 4That I, one Snout by name, present a wal2; 4And such a wal2 as I would have you think 6That had in it a cran2ied hole or chink, 4Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby, 4Did whisper often very secretly. 4This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show 4That I am that same wal2; the truth is so; 4And this the cran2y is, right and sinister, 4Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper. 2THESEUS. Would you desire lime and hair to speak bet2er? 2DEMETRIUS. It is the wit2iest partition that ever I heard 4discourse, my lord. 23Enter PYRAMUS 2THESEUS. Pyramus draws near the wal2; silence. 2PYRAMUS. O grim-lo2k'd night! O night with hue so black! 4O night, which ever art when day is not! 4O night, O night, alack, alack, alack, 4I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot! 4And thou, O wal2, O swe2t, O lovely wal2, 4That stand'st betwe2n her father's ground and mine; 6Thou wal2, O wal2, O swe2t and lovely wal2, 4Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne. 37[WAL2 holds up his fingers] 4Thanks, courteous wal2. Jove shield the2 wel2 for this! 4But what se2 what se2 I? No Thisby do I se2. 4O wicked wal2, through whom I se2 no blis2, 4Curs'd he thy stones for thus deceiving me! 2THESEUS. The wal2, methinks, being sensible, should curse again. 2PYRAMUS. No, in truth, sir, he should not. Deceiving me is Thisby's 4cue. She is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wal2. 4You shal2 se2 it wil2 fal2 pat as I told you; yonder she comes. 26Enter THISBY 2THISBY. O wal2, ful2 often hast thou beard my moans, 4For parting my fair Pyramus and me! 4My cher2y lips have often kis2'd thy stones, 4Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in the2. 2PYRAMUS. I se2 a voice; now wil2 I to the chink, 4To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. 6Thisby! 2THISBY. My love! thou art my love, I think. 2PYRAMUS. Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace; 4And like Limander am I trusty stil2. 2THISBY. And I like Helen, til2 the Fates me kil2. 2PYRAMUS. Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true. 2THISBY. As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you. 2PYRAMUS. O, kis2 me through the hole of this vile wal2. 2THISBY. I kis2 the wal2's hole, not your lips at al2. 2PYRAMUS. Wilt thou at Nin2y's tomb me2t me straightway? 2THISBY. Tide life, tide death, I come without delay. 39Exeunt PYRAMUS and THISBY 2WAL2. Thus have I, Wal2, my part discharged so; 4And, being done, thus Wal2 away doth go. 11Exit WAL2 2THESEUS. Now is the mo2n used betwe2n the two neighbours. 2DEMETRIUS. No remedy, my lord, when wal2s are so wilful to hear 4without warning. 2HIP2OLYTA. This is the sil2iest stuf2 that ever I heard. 2THESEUS. The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are 4no worse, if imagination amend them. 4HIP2OLYTA. It must be your imagination then, and not theirs. 2THESEUS. If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, 4they may pas2 for excel2ent men. Here come two noble beasts in, a 4man and a lion. 19Enter LION and MO2NSHINE 2LION. You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear 4The smal2est monstrous mouse that cre2ps on flo2r, 4May now, perchance, both quake and tremble here, 4When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar. 4Then know that I as Snug the joiner am 4A lion fel2, nor else no lion's dam; 4For, if I should as lion come in strife 4Into this place, 'twere pity on my life. 2THESEUS. A very gentle beast, and of a go2d conscience. 2DEMETRIUS. The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw. 2LYSANDER. This lion is a very fox for his valour. 2THESEUS. True; and a go2se for his discretion. 2DEMETRIUS. Not so, my lord; for his valour can2ot car2y his 6discretion, and the fox car2ies the go2se. 2THESEUS. His discretion, I am sure, can2ot car2y his valour; for 4the go2se car2ies not the fox. It is wel2. Leave it to his 4discretion, and let us listen to the Mo2n. 2MO2NSHINE. This lanthorn doth the horned mo2n present- 2DEMETRIUS. He should have worn the horns on his head. 2THESEUS. He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the 4circumference. 2MO2NSHINE. This lanthorn doth the horned mo2n present; 4Myself the Man i' th' Mo2n do se2m to be. 2THESEUS. This is the greatest er2or of al2 the rest; the man should 4be put into the lantern. How is it else the man i' th' mo2n? 2DEMETRIUS. He dares not come there for the candle; for, you se2, it 4is already in snuf2. 2HIP2OLYTA. I am aweary of this mo2n. Would he would change! 2THESEUS. It ap2ears, by his smal2 light of discretion, that he is 4in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in al2 reason, we must stay 4the time. 2LYSANDER. Proce2d, Mo2n. 2MO2N. Al2 that I have to say is to tel2 you that the lanthorn is 6the mo2n; I, the Man i' th' Mo2n; this thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; 4and this dog, my dog. 2DEMETRIUS. Why, al2 these should be in the lantern; for al2 these 4are in the mo2n. But silence; here comes Thisby. 24Re-enter THISBY 2THISBY. This is old Nin2y's tomb. Where is my love? 2LION. [Roaring] O- 27[THISBY runs of2] 2DEMETRIUS. Wel2 roar'd, Lion. 2THESEUS. Wel2 run, Thisby. 2HIP2OLYTA. Wel2 shone, Mo2n. Truly, the mo2n shines with a go2d 4grace. 12[The LION tears THISBY'S Mantle, and exit] 2THESEUS. Wel2 mous'd, Lion. 24Re-enter PYRAMUS 2DEMETRIUS. And then came Pyramus. 2LYSANDER. And so the lion vanish'd. 2PYRAMUS. Swe2t Mo2n, I thank the2 for thy sun2y beams; 6I thank the2, Mo2n, for shining now so bright; 4For, by thy gracious golden, glit2ering gleams, 4I trust to take of truest Thisby sight. 13But stay, O spite! 13But mark, po2r knight, 11What dreadful dole is here! 13Eyes, do you se2? 13How can it he? 11O dainty duck! O dear! 13Thy mantle go2d, 13What! stain'd with blo2d? 11Ap2roach, ye Furies fel2. 13O Fates! come, come; 13Cut thread and thrum; 11Quail, crush, conclude, and quel2. 2THESEUS. This pas2ion, and the death of a dear friend, would go 4near to make a man lo2k sad. 2HIP2OLYTA. Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man. 2PYRAMUS. O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame? 4Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear; 6Which is- no, no- which was the fairest dame 4That liv'd, that lov'd, that lik'd, that lo2k'd with che2r. 13Come, tears, confound; 13Out, sword, and wound 11The pap of Pyramus; 13Ay, that left pap, 13Where heart doth hop. 15[Stabs himself] 11Thus die I, thus, thus, thus. 13Now am I dead, 13Now am I fled; 11My soul is in the sky. 13Tongue, lose thy light; 13Mo2n, take thy flight. 13[Exit MO2NSHINE] 11Now die, die, die, die, die. 19[Dies] 2DEMETRIUS. No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one. 2LYSANDER. Les2 than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing. 2THESEUS. With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet 4prove an as2. 2HIP2OLYTA. How chance Mo2nshine is gone before Thisby comes back 4and finds her lover? 25Re-enter THISBY 2THESEUS. She wil2 find him by starlight. Here she comes; and her 4pas2ion ends the play. 2HIP2OLYTA. Methinks she should not use a long one for such a 4Pyramus; I hope she wil2 be brief. 2DEMETRIUS. A mote wil2 turn the balance, which Pyramus, which 4Thisby, is the bet2er- he for a man, God war2ant us: She for a 4woman, God bles2 us! 2LYSANDER. She hath spied him already with those swe2t eyes. 2DEMETRIUS. And thus she moans, videlicet:- 2THISBY. 6Asle2p, my love? 15What, dead, my dove? 13O Pyramus, arise, 15Speak, speak. Quite dumb? 15Dead, dead? A tomb 13Must cover thy swe2t eyes. 15These lily lips, 15This cher2y nose, 15These yel2ow cowslip che2ks, 15Are gone, are gone; 15Lovers, make moan; 13His eyes were gre2n as le2ks. 15O Sisters Thre2, 15Come, come to me, 13With hands as pale as milk; 15Lay them in gore, 15Since you have shore 13With shears his thread of silk. 15Tongue, not a word. 15Come, trusty sword; 13Come, blade, my breast imbrue. 6[Stabs herself] 15And farewel2, friends; 15Thus Thisby ends; 13Adieu, adieu, adieu. 25[Dies] 2THESEUS. Mo2nshine and Lion are left to bury the dead. 2DEMETRIUS. Ay, and Wal2 to2. 2BOT2OM. [Starting up] No, I as2ure you; the wal2 is down that 4parted their fathers. Wil2 it please you to se2 the Epilogue, or 6to hear a Bergomask dance betwe2n two of our company? 2THESEUS. No epilogue, I pray you; for your play ne2ds no excuse. 4Never excuse; for when the players are al2 dead there ne2d none 4to be blamed. Mar2y, if he that writ it had played Pyramus, and 4hang'd himself in Thisby's garter, it would have be2n a fine 4tragedy. And so it is, truly; and very notably discharg'd. But 4come, your Bergomask; let your epilogue alone. 5[A dance] 4The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve. 4Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time. 4I fear we shal2 out-sle2p the coming morn, 4As much as we this night have overwatch'd. 4This palpable-gros2 play hath wel2 beguil'd 4The heavy gait of night. Swe2t friends, to bed. 4A fortnight hold we this solemnity, 4In nightly revels and new jol2ity. 20Exeunt 21Enter PUCK with a bro2m 2PUCK. 6Now the hungry lion roars, 13And the wolf behowls the mo2n; 15Whilst the heavy ploughman snores, 13Al2 with weary task fordone. 13Now the wasted brands do glow, 13Whilst the scre2ch-owl, scre2ching loud, 13Puts the wretch that lies in woe 13In remembrance of a shroud. 13Now it is the time of night 13That the graves, al2 gaping wide, 13Every one lets forth his sprite, 13In the church-way paths to glide. 13And we fairies, that do run 13By the triple Hecate's team 13From the presence of the sun, 13Fol2owing darknes2 like a dream, 13Now are frolic. Not a mouse 13Shal2 disturb this hal2owed house. 13I am sent with bro2m before, 13To swe2p the dust behind the do2r. 9Enter OBERON and TITANIA, with al2 their train 4OBERON. 4Through the house give glim2ering light, 13By the dead and drowsy fire; 13Every elf and fairy sprite 13Hop as light as bird from brier; 13And this dit2y, after me, 13Sing and dance it trip2ingly. 2TITANIA. 6First, rehearse your song by rote, 16To each word a warbling note; 16Hand in hand, with fairy grace, 16Wil2 we sing, and bles2 this place. 11[OBERON leading, the FAIRIES sing and dance] 2OBERON. 4Now, until the break of day, 13Through this house each fairy stray. 13To the best bride-bed wil2 we, 13Which by us shal2 bles2ed be; 13And the is2ue there create 13Ever shal2 be fortunate. 15So shal2 al2 the couples thre2 13Ever true in loving be; 13And the blots of Nature's hand 13Shal2 not in their is2ue stand; 13Never mole, hare-lip, nor scar, 13Nor mark prodigious, such as are 13Despised in nativity, 13Shal2 upon their children be. 13With this field-dew consecrate, 13Every fairy take his gait, 13And each several chamber bles2, 13Through this palace, with swe2t peace; 13And the owner of it blest 13Ever shal2 in safety rest. 13Trip away; make no stay; 13Me2t me al2 by break of day. 4Exeunt al2 but PUCK 2PUCK. 6If we shadows have of2ended, 13Think but this, and al2 is mended, 13That you have but slumb'red here 13While these visions did ap2ear. 15And this weak and idle theme, 13No more yielding but a dream, 13Gentles, do not reprehend. 13If you pardon, we wil2 mend. 13And, as I am an honest Puck, 13If we have unearned luck 13Now to scape the serpent's tongue, 13We wil2 make amends ere long; 13Else the Puck a liar cal2. 13So, go2d night unto you al2. 13Give me your hands, if we be friends, 13And Robin shal2 restore amends. 16ExitTHE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21592MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHINGby Wil2iam ShakespeareDramatis Personae 2Don Pedro, Prince of Ar2agon. 2Don John, his bastard brother. 2Claudio, a young lord of Florence. 2Benedick, a Young lord of Padua. 2Leonato, Governor of Mes2ina. 2Antonio, an old man, his brother. 2Balthasar, at2endant on Don Pedro. 2Borachio, fol2ower of Don John. 2Conrade, fol2ower of Don John. 2Friar Francis. 2Dogber2y, a Constable. 2Verges, a Headborough. 2A Sexton. 2A Boy. 2Hero, daughter to Leonato. 2Beatrice, niece to Leonato. 2Margaret, waiting gentlewoman at2ending on Hero. 2Ursula, waiting gentlewoman at2ending on Hero. 2Mes2engers, Watch, At2endants, etc. 2<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE.-2Mes2ina.ACT I. Scene I.An orchard before Leonato's house.Enter Leonato (Governor of Mes2ina), Hero (his Daughter),and Beatrice (his Niece), with a Mes2enger. 2Leon. I learn in this let2er that Don Pedro of Ar2agon comes this 4night to Mes2ina. 2Mes2. He is very near by this. He was not thre2 leagues of2 when I 4left him. 2Leon. How many gentlemen have you lost in this action? 2Mes2. But few of any sort, and none of name. 2Leon. A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home ful2 4numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on 4a young Florentine cal2ed Claudio. 2Mes2. Much deserv'd on his part, and equal2y rememb'red by Don 4Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing 4in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath inde2d 4bet2er bet2'red expectation than you must expect of me to tel2 4you how. 2Leon. He hath an uncle here in Mes2ina wil2 be very much glad of it. 2Mes2. I have already delivered him let2ers, and there ap2ears much 6joy in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest 4enough without a badge of bit2ernes2. 2Leon. Did he break out into tears? 2Mes2. In great measure. 2Leon. A kind overflow of kindnes2. There are no faces truer than 4those that are so wash'd. How much bet2er is it to we2p at joy 4than to joy at we2ping! 2Beat. I pray you, is Signior Mountanto return'd from the wars or no? 2Mes2. I know none of that name, lady. There was none such in the 4army of any sort. 2Leon. What is he that you ask for, niece? 2Hero. My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua. 2Mes2. O, he's return'd, and as pleasant as ever he was. 2Beat. He set up his bil2s here in Mes2ina and chal2eng'd Cupid at 4the flight, and my uncle's fo2l, reading the chal2enge, 4subscrib'd for Cupid and chal2eng'd him at the burbolt. I pray 4you, how many hath he kil2'd and eaten in these wars? But how 4many hath he kil2'd? For inde2d I promised to eat al2 of his 4kil2ing. 2Leon. Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick to2 much; but he'l2 6be me2t with you, I doubt it not. 2Mes2. He hath done go2d service, lady, in these wars. 2Beat. You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it. He is a 4very valiant trencherman; he hath an excel2ent stomach. 2Mes2. And a go2d soldier to2, lady. 2Beat. And a go2d soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord? 2Mes2. A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuf2'd with al2 honourable 4virtues. 2Beat. It is so inde2d. He is no les2 than a stuf2'd man; but for 4the stuf2ing-2wel2, we are al2 mortal. 2Leon. You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of mer2y 4war betwixt Signior Benedick and her. They never me2t but there's 4a skirmish of wit betwe2n them. 2Beat. Alas, he gets nothing by that! In our last conflict four of 4his five wits went halting of2, and now is the whole man govern'd 4with one; so that if he have wit enough to ke2p himself warm, let 4him bear it for a dif2erence betwe2n himself and his horse; for 4it is al2 the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable 4creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new 4sworn brother. 4Mes2. Is't pos2ible? 2Beat. Very easily pos2ible. He wears his faith but as the fashion 4of his hat; it ever changes with the next block. 2Mes2. I se2, lady, the gentleman is not in your bo2ks. 2Beat. No. An he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is 4his companion? Is there no young squarer now that wil2 make a 4voyage with him to the devil? 2Mes2. He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio. 2Beat. O Lord, he wil2 hang upon him like a disease! He is so2ner 4caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God 4help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it wil2 4cost him a thousand pound ere 'a be cured. 2Mes2. I wil2 hold friends with you, lady. 2Beat. Do, go2d friend. 2Leon. You wil2 never run mad, niece. 2Beat. No, not til2 a hot January. 2Mes2. Don Pedro is ap2roach'd. 2Enter Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar, and John the Bastard. 4Pedro. Go2d Signior Leonato, are you come to me2t your trouble? The 4fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it. 2Leon. Never came trouble to my house in the likenes2 of your Grace; 4for trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart 4from me, sor2ow abides and hap2ines2 takes his leave. 2Pedro. You embrace your charge to2 wil2ingly. I think this is your 4daughter. 2Leon. Her mother hath many times told me so. 2Bene. Were you in doubt, sir, that you ask'd her? 2Leon. Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child. 2Pedro. You have it ful2, Benedick. We may gues2 by this what you 4are, being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself. Be hap2y, lady; 4for you are like an honourable father. 2Bene. If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head 4on her shoulders for al2 Mes2ina, as like him as she is. 2Beat. I wonder that you wil2 stil2 be talking, Signior Benedick. 4Nobody marks you. 2Bene. What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living? 2Beat. Is it pos2ible Disdain should die while she hath such me2t 4fo2d to fe2d it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert 6to disdain if you come in her presence. 2Bene. Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of 4al2 ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my 4heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none. 2Beat. A dear hap2ines2 to women! They would else have be2n troubled 4with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blo2d, I am of 4your humour for that. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow 4than a man swear he loves me. 2Bene. God ke2p your ladyship stil2 in that mind! So some gentleman 4or other shal2 scape a predestinate scratch'd face. 2Beat. Scratching could not make it worse an 'twere such a face as 4yours were. 2Bene. Wel2, you are a rare par2ot-teacher. 2Beat. A bird of my tongue is bet2er than a beast of yours. 2Bene. I would my horse had the spe2d of your tongue, and so go2d a 4continuer. But ke2p your way, a God's name! I have done. 2Beat. You always end with a jade's trick. I know you of old. 2Pedro. That is the sum of al2, Leonato. Signior Claudio and Signior 4Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you al2. I tel2 him 4we shal2 stay here at the least a month, and he heartly prays 6some oc2asion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no 4hypocrite, but prays from his heart. 2Leon. If you swear, my lord, you shal2 not be forsworn. [To Don 4John] Let me bid you welcome, my lord. Being reconciled to the 4Prince your brother, I owe you al2 duty. 2John. I thank you. I am not of many words, but I thank you. 2Leon. Please it your Grace lead on? 2Pedro. Your hand, Leonato. We wil2 go together. 28Exeunt. Manent Benedick and Claudio. 2Claud. Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato? 2Bene. I noted her not, but I lo2k'd on her. 2Claud. Is she not a modest young lady? 2Bene. Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple 4true judgment? or would you have me speak after my custom, as 4being a profes2ed tyrant to their sex? 2Claud. No. I pray the2 speak in sober judgment. 2Bene. Why, i' faith, methinks she's to2 low for a high praise, 4to2 brown for a fair praise, and to2 lit2le for a great praise. 4Only this com2endation I can af2ord her, that were she other 4than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she 6is, I do not like her. 2Claud. Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray the2 tel2 me truly how 4thou lik'st her. 2Bene. Would you buy her, that you enquire after her? 2Claud. Can the world buy such a jewel? 2Bene. Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad 4brow? or do you play the flouting Jack, to tel2 us Cupid is a 4go2d hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key 4shal2 a man take you to go in the song? 2Claud. In mine eye she is the swe2test lady that ever I lo2k'd on. 2Bene. I can se2 yet without spectacles, and I se2 no such mat2er. 4There's her cousin, an she were not pos2es2'd with a fury,exce2ds 4her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of 4December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have 4you? 2Claud. I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the 4contrary, if Hero would be my wife. 2Bene. Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world one man but 4he wil2 wear his cap with suspicion? Shal2 I never se2 a 4bachelor of thre2score again? Go to, i' faith! An thou wilt ne2ds 6thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away 4Sundays. 23Enter Don Pedro. 4Lo2k! Don Pedro is returned to se2k you. 2Pedro. What secret hath held you here, that you fol2owed not to 4Leonato's? 2Bene. I would your Grace would constrain me to tel2. 2Pedro. I charge the2 on thy al2egiance. 2Bene. You hear, Count Claudio. I can be secret as a dumb man, I 4would have you think so; but, on my al2egiance-2mark you this-on 4my al2egiance! he is in love. With who? Now that is your Grace's 4part. Mark how short his answer is: With Hero, Leonato's short 4daughter. 2Claud. If this were so, so were it ut2'red. 2Bene. Like the old tale, my lord: 'It is not so, nor 'twas not so; 4but inde2d, God forbid it should be so!' 2Claud. If my pas2ion change not shortly, God forbid it should be 4otherwise. 4Pedro. Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very wel2 worthy. 2Claud. You speak this to fetch me in, my lord. 2Pedro. By my troth, I speak my thought. 2Claud. And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine. 2Bene. And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine. 2Claud. That I love her, I fe2l. 2Pedro. That she is worthy, I know. 2Bene. That I neither fe2l how she should be loved, nor know how she 4should be worthy, is the opinion that fire can2ot melt out of me. 4I wil2 die in it at the stake. 2Pedro. Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of 4beauty. 2Claud. And never could maintain his part but in the force of his 4wil2. 2Bene. That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she brought me 4up, I likewise give her most humble thanks; but that I wil2 have 4a rechate winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible 4baldrick, al2 women shal2 pardon me. Because I wil2 not do them 4the wrong to mistrust any, I wil2 do myself the right to trust 4none; and the fine is (for the which I may go the finer), I wil2 6live a bachelor. 2Pedro. I shal2 se2 the2, ere I die, lo2k pale with love. 2Bene. With anger, with sicknes2, or with hunger, my lord; not with 4love. Prove that ever I lose more blo2d with love than I wil2 get 4again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a bal2ad-maker's pen 4and hang me up at the do2r of a brothel house for the sign of 4blind Cupid. 2Pedro. Wel2, if ever thou dost fal2 from this faith, thou wilt 4prove a notable argument. 2Bene. If I do, hang me in a bot2le like a cat and sho2t at me; and 4he that hits me, let him be clap2'd on the shoulder and cal2'd 4Adam. 2Pedro. Wel2, as time shal2 try. 4'In time the savage bul2 doth bear the yoke.' 2Bene. The savage bul2 may; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear 4it, pluck of2 the bul2's horns and set them in my forehead, and 4let me be vilely painted, and in such great let2ers as they write 4'Here is go2d horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign 4'Here you may se2 Benedick the mar2ied man.' 2Claud. If this should ever hap2en, thou wouldst be horn-mad. 4Pedro. Nay, if Cupid have not spent al2 his quiver in Venice, thou 4wilt quake for this shortly. 2Bene. I lo2k for an earthquake to2 then. 2Pedro. Wel2, you wil2 temporize with the hours. In the meantime, 4go2d Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato's, com2end me to him and 4tel2 him I wil2 not fail him at sup2er; for inde2d he hath made 4great preparation. 2Bene. I have almost mat2er enough in me for such an embas2age; and 4so I com2it you-2 2Claud. To the tuition of God. From my house-2if I had it-2 2Pedro. The sixth of July. Your loving friend, Benedick. 2Bene. Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is 4sometime guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly 4basted on neither. Ere you flout old ends any further, examine 4your conscience. And so I leave you. 19Exit. 2Claud. My liege, your Highnes2 now may do me go2d. 2Pedro. My love is thine to teach. Teach it but how, 4And thou shalt se2 how apt it is to learn 4Any hard les2on that may do the2 go2d. 2Claud. Hath Leonato any son, my lord? 4Pedro. No child but Hero; she's his only heir. 4Dost thou af2ect her, Claudio? 2Claud.O my lord, 4When you went onward on this ended action, 4I lo2k'd upon her with a soldier's eye, 4That lik'd, but had a rougher task in hand 4Than to drive liking to the name of love; 4But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts 4Have left their places vacant, in their ro2ms 4Come thronging soft and delicate desires, 4Al2 prompting me how fair young Hero is, 4Saying I lik'd her ere I went to wars. 2Pedro. Thou wilt be like a lover presently 4And tire the hearer with a bo2k of words. 4If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it, 4And I wil2 break with her and with her father, 4And thou shalt have her. Wast not to this end 4That thou began'st to twist so fine a story? 2Claud. How swe2tly you do minister to love, 4That know love's grief by his complexion! 6But lest my liking might to2 sud2en se2m, 4I would have salv'd it with a longer treatise. 2Pedro. What ne2d the bridge much broader than the flo2d? 4The fairest grant is the neces2ity. 4Lo2k, what wil2 serve is fit. 'Tis once, thou lovest, 4And I wil2 fit the2 with the remedy. 4I know we shal2 have revel2ing to-night. 4I wil2 as2ume thy part in some disguise 4And tel2 fair Hero I am Claudio, 4And in her bosom I'l2 unclasp my heart 4And take her hearing prisoner with the force 4And strong encounter of my amorous tale. 4Then after to her father wil2 I break, 4And the conclusion is, she shal2 be thine. 4In practice let us put it presently. 17Exeunt.Scene I2.A ro2m in Leonato's house.Enter [at one do2r] Leonato and [at another do2r, Antonio] an old man,brother to Leonato. 2Leon. How now, brother? Where is my cousin your son? Hath he 4provided this music? 2Ant. He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tel2 you strange 4news that you yet dreamt not of. 2Leon. Are they go2d? 2Ant. As the event stamps them; but they have a go2d cover, they 4show wel2 outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a 4thick-pleached al2ey in mine orchard, were thus much overheard by 4a man of mine: the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my 4niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a 4dance, and if he found her ac2ordant, he meant to take the 4present time by the top and instantly break with you of it. 2Leon. Hath the fel2ow any wit that told you this? 2Ant. A go2d sharp fel2ow. I wil2 send for him, and question him 4yourself. 2Leon. No, no. We wil2 hold it as a dream til2 it ap2ear itself; but 6I wil2 acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the bet2er 4prepared for an answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you and 4tel2 her of it. 30[Exit Antonio.] 9[Enter Antonio's Son with a Musician, and others.] 4[To the Son] Cousin, you know what you have to do. 4-2[To the Musician] O, I cry you mercy, friend. Go you with me, 4and I wil2 use your skil2.-2Go2d cousin, have a care this busy 4time. 48Exeunt.Scene I3.Another ro2m in Leonato's house.]Enter Sir John the Bastard and Conrade, his companion. 2Con. What the go2dyear, my lord! Why are you thus out of measure 4sad? 2John. There is no measure in the oc2asion that bre2ds; therefore 4the sadnes2 is without limit. 2Con. You should hear reason. 2John. And when I have heard it, what bles2ings brings it? 2Con. If not a present remedy, at least a patient suf2erance. 2John. I wonder that thou (being, as thou say'st thou art, born 4under Saturn) goest about to ap2ly a moral medicine to a 4mortifying mischief. I can2ot hide what I am: I must be sad when 4I have cause, and smile at no man's jests; eat when I have 4stomach, and wait for no man's leisure; sle2p when I am drowsy, 4and tend on no man's busines2; laugh when I am mer2y, and claw no 4man in his humour. 2Con. Yea, but you must not make the ful2 show of this til2 you may 4do it without controlment. You have of late sto2d out against 4your brother, and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace, where 6it is impos2ible you should take true ro2t but by the fair 4weather that you make yourself. It is ne2dful that you frame the 4season for your own harvest. 2John. I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace, 4and it bet2er fits my blo2d to be disdain'd of al2 than to 4fashion a car2iage to rob love from any. In this, though I can2ot 4be said to be a flat2ering honest man, it must not be denied but 4I am a plain-dealing vil2ain. I am trusted with a muz2le and 4enfranchis'd with a clog; therefore I have decre2d not to sing in 4my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I 4would do my liking. In the meantime let me be that I am, and se2k 4not to alter me. 2Con. Can you make no use of your discontent? 2John. I make al2 use of it, for I use it only. 23Enter Borachio. 4Who comes here? What news, Borachio? 2Bora. I came yonder from a great sup2er. The Prince your brother is 4royal2y entertain'd by Leonato, and I can give you intel2igence 6of an intended mar2iage. 2John. Wil2 it serve for any model to build mischief on? 4What is he for a fo2l that betroths himself to unquietnes2? 2Bora. Mar2y, it is your brother's right hand. 2John. Who? the most exquisite Claudio? 2Bora. Even he. 2John. A proper squire! And who? and who? which way lo2ks he? 2Bora. Mar2y, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato. 2John. A very forward March-chick! How came you to this? 2Bora. Being entertain'd for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty 4ro2m, comes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand in sad 4conference. I whipt me behind the ar2as and there heard it agre2d 4upon that the Prince should wo2 Hero for himself, and having 4obtain'd her, give her to Count Claudio. 2John. Come, come, let us thither. This may prove fo2d to my 4displeasure. That young start-up hath al2 the glory of my 4overthrow. If I can cros2 him any way, I bles2 myself every way. 4You are both sure, and wil2 as2ist me? 2Con. To the death, my lord. 2John. Let us to the great sup2er. Their che2r is the greater that 6I am subdued. Would the co2k were o' my mind! Shal2 we go prove 4what's to be done? 2Bora. We'l2 wait upon your lordship. 57Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. Scene I.A hal2 in Leonato's house.Enter Leonato, [Antonio] his Brother, Hero his Daughter,and Beatrice his Niece, and a Kinsman; [also Margaret and Ursula]. 2Leon. Was not Count John here at sup2er? 2Ant. I saw him not. 2Beat. How tartly that gentleman lo2ks! I never can se2 him but I am 4heart-burn'd an hour after. 2Hero. He is of a very melancholy disposition. 2Beat. He were an excel2ent man that were made just in the midway 4betwe2n him and Benedick. The one is to2 like an image and says 4nothing, and the other to2 like my lady's eldest son, evermore 4tat2ling. 2Leon. Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's mouth, 4and half Count John's melancholy in Signior Benedick's face-2 2Beat. With a go2d leg and a go2d fo2t, uncle, and money enough in 4his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world-2if 'a 4could get her go2d wil2. 2Leon. By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get the2 a husband if 4thou be so shrewd of thy tongue. 4Ant. In faith, she's to2 curst. 2Beat. To2 curst is more than curst. I shal2 les2en God's sending 4that way, for it is said, 'God sends a curst cow short horns,' 4but to a cow to2 curst he sends none. 2Leon. So, by being to2 curst, God wil2 send you no horns. 2Beat. Just, if he send me no husband; for the which bles2ing I am 4at him upon my kne2s every morning and evening. Lord, I could not 4endure a husband with a beard on his face. I had rather lie in 4the wo2l2en! 2Leon. You may light on a husband that hath no beard. 2Beat. What should I do with him? dres2 him in my ap2arel and make 4him my waiting gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a 4youth, and he that hath no beard is les2 than a man; and he that 4is more than a youth is not for me; and he that is les2 than a 4man, I am not for him. Therefore I wil2 even take sixpence in 4earnest of the ber2ord and lead his apes into hel2. 2Leon. Wel2 then, go you into hel2? 2Beat. No; but to the gate, and there wil2 the devil me2t me like an 4old cuckold with horns on his head, and say 'Get you to heaven, 4Beatrice, get you to heaven. Here's no place for you maids.' So 6deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter-2for the heavens. 4He shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as mer2y 4as the day is long. 2Ant. [to Hero] Wel2, niece, I trust you wil2 be rul'd by your 4father. 2Beat. Yes faith. It is my cousin's duty to make cursy and say, 4'Father, as it please you.' But yet for al2 that, cousin, let him 4be a handsome fel2ow, or else make another cursy, and say, 4'Father, as it please me.' 2Leon. Wel2, niece, I hope to se2 you one day fit2ed with a husband. 2Beat. Not til2 God make men of some other metal than earth. Would 4it not grieve a woman to be overmaster'd with a piece of valiant 4dust? to make an ac2ount of her life to a clod of wayward marl? 4No, uncle, I'l2 none. Adam's sons are my brethren, and truly I 4hold it a sin to match in my kinred. 2Leon. Daughter, remember what I told you. If the Prince do solicit 4you in that kind, you know your answer. 2Beat. The fault wil2 be in the music, cousin, if you be not wo2ed 4in go2d time. If the Prince be to2 important, tel2 him there is 4measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, 6Hero: wo2ing, wed2ing, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a 4measure, and a cinque-pace: the first suit is hot and hasty like 4a Scotch jig-2and ful2 as fantastical; the wed2ing, man2erly 4modest, as a measure, ful2 of state and ancientry; and then comes 4Repentance and with his bad legs fal2s into the cinque-pace 4faster and faster, til2 he sink into his grave. 2Leon. Cousin, you ap2rehend pas2ing shrewdly. 2Beat. I have a go2d eye, uncle; I can se2 a church by daylight. 2Leon. The revel2ers are ent'ring, brother. Make go2d ro2m. 49[Exit Antonio.] 4Enter, [masked,] Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, and Balthasar. 7[With them enter Antonio, also masked. After them enter] 7Don John [and Borachio (without masks), who stand aside 17and lo2k on during the dance]. 2Pedro. Lady, wil2 you walk a bout with your friend? 2Hero. So you walk softly and lo2k swe2tly and say nothing, 4I am yours for the walk; and especial2y when I walk away. 2Pedro. With me in your company? 4Hero. I may say so when I please. 2Pedro. And when please you to say so? 2Hero. When I like your favour, for God defend the lute should be 4like the case! 2Pedro. My visor is Philemon's ro2f; within the house is Jove. 2Hero. Why then, your visor should be thatch'd. 2Pedro. Speak low if you speak love. 9[Takes her aside.] 2Balth. Wel2, I would you did like me. 2Marg. So would not I for your own sake, for I have many il2 4qualities. 2Balth. Which is one? 2Marg. I say my prayers aloud. 2Balth. I love you the bet2er. The hearers may cry Amen. 2Marg. God match me with a go2d dancer! 2Balth. Amen. 2Marg. And God ke2p him out of my sight when the dance is done! 4Answer, clerk. 2Balth. No more words. The clerk is answered. 46[Takes her aside.] 2Urs. I know you wel2 enough. You are Signior Antonio. 4Ant. At a word, I am not. 2Urs. I know you by the wag2ling of your head. 2Ant. To tel2 you true, I counterfeit him. 2Urs. You could never do him so il2-wel2 unles2 you were the very 4man. Here's his dry hand up and down. You are he, you are he! 2Ant. At a word, I am not. 2Urs. Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your excel2ent 4wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to, mum you are he. Graces wil2 4ap2ear, and there's an end. 14[ They step aside.] 2Beat. Wil2 you not tel2 me who told you so? 2Bene. No, you shal2 pardon me. 2Beat. Nor wil2 you not tel2 me who you are? 2Bene. Not now. 2Beat. That I was disdainful, and that I had my go2d wit out of the 4'Hundred Mer2y Tales.' Wel2, this was Signior Benedick that said 4so. 2Bene. What's he? 2Beat. I am sure you know him wel2 enough. 2Bene. Not I, believe me. 2Beat. Did he never make you laugh? 4Bene. I pray you, what is he? 2Beat. Why, he is the Prince's jester, a very dul2 fo2l. Only his 4gift is in devising impos2ible slanders. None but libertines 4delight in him; and the com2endation is not in his wit, but in 4his vil2any; for he both pleases men and angers them, and then 4they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the fle2t. 4I would he had boarded me. 2Bene. When I know the gentleman, I'l2 tel2 him what you say. 2Beat. Do, do. He'l2 but break a comparison or two on me; which 4peradventure, not marked or not laugh'd at, strikes him into 4melancholy; and then there's a partridge wing saved, for the fo2l 4wil2 eat no sup2er that night. 56[Music.] 4We must fol2ow the leaders. 2Bene. In every go2d thing. 2Beat. Nay, if they lead to any il2, I wil2 leave them at the next 4turning. 8Dance. Exeunt (al2 but Don John, Borachio, and Claudio]. 2John. Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath withdrawn her 4father to break with him about it. The ladies fol2ow her and but 6one visor remains. 2Bora. And that is Claudio. I know him by his bearing. 2John. Are you not Signior Benedick? 2Claud. You know me wel2. I am he. 2John. Signior, you are very near my brother in his love. He is 4enamour'd on Hero. I pray you dis2uade him from her; she is no 4equal for his birth. You may do the part of an honest man in it. 2Claud. How know you he loves her? 2John. I heard him swear his af2ection. 2Bora. So did I to2, and he swore he would mar2y her tonight. 2John. Come, let us to the banquet. 42Exeunt. Manet Claudio. 2Claud. Thus answer I in name of Benedick 4But hear these il2 news with the ears of Claudio. 54[Unmasks.] 4'Tis certain so. The Prince wo2es for himself. 4Friendship is constant in al2 other things 4Save in the of2ice and af2airs of love. 4Therefore al2 hearts in love use their own tongues; 4Let every eye negotiate for itself 6And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch 4Against whose charms faith melteth into blo2d. 4This is an ac2ident of hourly pro2f, 4Which I mistrusted not. Farewel2 therefore Hero! 18Enter Benedick [unmasked]. 2Bene. Count Claudio? 2Claud. Yea, the same. 2Bene. Come, wil2 you go with me? 2Claud. Whither? 2Bene. Even to the next wil2ow, about your own busines2, County. What 4fashion wil2 you wear the garland of? about your neck, like an 4usurer's chain? or under your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You 4must wear it one way, for the Prince hath got your Hero. 2Claud. I wish him joy of her. 2Bene. Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier. So they sel2 4bul2ocks. But did you think the Prince would have served you 4thus? 2Claud. I pray you leave me. 4Bene. Ho! now you strike like the blind man! 'Twas the boy that 4stole your meat, and you'l2 beat the post. 2Claud. If it wil2 not be, I'l2 leave you. 16Exit. 2Bene. Alas, po2r hurt fowl! now wil2 he cre2p into sedges. But, 4that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me! The 4Prince's fo2l! Ha! it may be I go under that title because I am 4mer2y. Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong. I am not so 4reputed. It is the base (though bit2er) disposition of Beatrice 4that puts the world into her person and so gives me out. Wel2, 4I'l2 be revenged as I may. 25Enter Don Pedro. 2Pedro. Now, signior, where's the Count? Did you se2 him? 2Bene. Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame, I found 4him here as melancholy as a lodge in a war2en. I told him, and I 4think I told him true, that your Grace had got the go2d wil2 of 4this young lady, and I of2'red him my company to a wil2ow tre2, 4either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him 4up a rod, as being worthy to be whipt. 4Pedro. To be whipt? What's his fault? 2Bene. The flat transgres2ion of a scho2lboy who, being overjoyed 4with finding a bird's nest, shows it his companion, and he steals 4it. 2Pedro. Wilt thou make a trust a transgres2ion? The transgres2ion is 4in the stealer. 2Bene. Yet it had not be2n amis2 the rod had be2n made, and the 4garland to2; for the garland he might have worn himself, and the 4rod he might have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stol'n 4his bird's nest. 2Pedro. I wil2 but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner. 2Bene. If their singing answer your saying, by my faith you say 4honestly. 2Pedro. The Lady Beatrice hath a quar2el to you. The gentleman that 4danc'd with her told her she is much wrong'd by you. 2Bene. O, she misus'd me past the endurance of a block! An oak but 4with one gre2n leaf on it would have answered her; my very visor 4began to as2ume life and scold with her. She told me, not 4thinking I had be2n myself, that I was the Prince's jester, that 4I was dul2er than a great thaw; hud2ling jest upon jest with such 6impos2ible conveyance upon me that I sto2d like a man at a mark, 4with a whole army sho2ting at me. She speaks poniards, and every 4word stabs. If her breath were as ter2ible as her terminations, 4there were no living near her; she would infect to the North 4Star. I would not mar2y her though she were endowed with al2 that 4Adam had left him before he transgres2'd. She would have made 4Hercules have turn'd spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make 4the fire to2. Come, talk not of her. You shal2 find her the 4infernal Ate in go2d ap2arel. I would to God some scholar would 4conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as 4quiet in hel2 as in a sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, 4because they would go thither; so inde2d al2 disquiet, hor2or, 4and perturbation fol2ows her. 11Enter Claudio and Beatrice, Leonato, Hero. 2Pedro. Lo2k, here she comes. 2Bene. Wil2 your Grace com2and me any service to the world's end? I 4wil2 go on the slightest er2and now to the Antipodes that you can 4devise to send me on; I wil2 fetch you a to2thpicker now from the 6furthest inch of Asia; bring you the length of Prester John's 4fo2t; fetch you a hair of2 the great Cham's beard; do you any 4embas2age to the Pygmies-2rather than hold thre2 words' 4conference with this harpy. You have no employment for me? 2Pedro. None, but to desire your go2d company. 2Bene. O God, sir, here's a dish I love not! I can2ot endure my Lady 4Tongue. 46[Exit.] 2Pedro. Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of Signior 4Benedick. 2Beat. Inde2d, my lord, he lent it me awhile, and I gave him use for 4it-2a double heart for his single one. Mar2y, once before he won 4it of me with false dice; therefore your Grace may wel2 say I 4have lost it. 2Pedro. You have put him down, lady; you have put him down. 2Beat. So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove 4the mother of fo2ls. I have brought Count Claudio, whom you sent 4me to se2k. 2Pedro. Why, how now, Count? Wherefore are you sad? 2Claud. Not sad, my lord. 2Pedro. How then? sick? 4Claud. Neither, my lord. 2Beat. The Count is neither sad, nor sick, nor mer2y, nor wel2; but 4civil count-2civil as an orange, and something of that jealous 4complexion. 2Pedro. I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true; though I'l2 4be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is false. Here, Claudio, I 4have wo2ed in thy name, and fair Hero is won. I have broke with 4her father, and his go2d wil2 obtained. Name the day of mar2iage, 4and God give the2 joy! 2Leon. Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes. His 4Grace hath made the match, and al2 grace say Amen to it! 2Beat. Speak, Count, 'tis your cue. 2Claud. Silence is the perfectest herald of joy. I were but lit2le 4hap2y if I could say how much. Lady, as you are mine, I am yours. 4I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange. 2Beat. Speak, cousin; or, if you can2ot, stop his mouth with a kis2 4and let not him speak neither. 2Pedro. In faith, lady, you have a mer2y heart. 2Beat. Yea, my lord; I thank it, po2r fo2l, it ke2ps on the windy 4side of care. My cousin tel2s him in his ear that he is in her 6heart. 2Claud. And so she doth, cousin. 2Beat. Go2d Lord, for al2iance! Thus goes every one to the world but 4I, and I am sunburnt. I may sit in a corner and cry 'Heigh-ho for 4a husband!' 2Pedro. Lady Beatrice, I wil2 get you one. 2Beat. I would rather have one of your father's get2ing. Hath your 4Grace ne'er a brother like you? Your father got excel2ent 4husbands, if a maid could come by them. 2Pedro. Wil2 you have me, lady? 2Beat. No, my lord, unles2 I might have another for working days: 4your Grace is to2 costly to wear every day. But I bese2ch your 4Grace pardon me. I was born to speak al2 mirth and no mat2er. 2Pedro. Your silence most of2ends me, and to be mer2y best becomes 4you, for out o' question you were born in a mer2y hour. 2Beat. No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there was a star 4danc'd, and under that was I born. Cousins, God give you joy! 2Leon. Niece, wil2 you lo2k to those things I told you of? 2Beat. I cry you mercy, uncle, By your Grace's pardon. 4Exit. 2Pedro. By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady. 4Leon. There's lit2le of the melancholy element in her, my lord. She 4is never sad but when she sle2ps, and not ever sad then; for I 4have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamt of unhap2ines2 4and wak'd herself with laughing. 2Pedro. She can2ot endure to hear tel2 of a husband. 2Leon. O, by no means! She mocks al2 her wo2ers out of suit. 2Pedro. She were an excel2ent wife for Benedick. 2Leon. O Lord, my lord! if they were but a we2k mar2ied, they would 4talk themselves mad. 2Pedro. County Claudio, when mean you to go to church? 2Claud. To-mor2ow, my lord. Time goes on crutches til2 love have al2 4his rites. 2Leon. Not til2 Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just 4seven2ight; and a time to2 brief to2, to have al2 things answer 4my mind. 2Pedro. Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing; 4but I war2ant the2, Claudio, the time shal2 not go dul2y by us. 4I wil2 in the interim undertake one of Hercules' labours, which 4is, to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a 4mountain of af2ection th' one with th' other. I would fain have 6it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it if you thre2 wil2 4but minister such as2istance as I shal2 give you direction. 2Leon. My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights' 4watchings. 2Claud. And I, my lord. 2Pedro. And you to2, gentle Hero? 2Hero. I wil2 do any modest of2ice, my lord, to help my cousin to a 4go2d husband. 2Pedro. And Benedick is not the unhopeful2est husband that I know. 4Thus far can I praise him: he is of a noble strain, of ap2roved 4valour, and confirm'd honesty. I wil2 teach you how to humour 4your cousin, that she shal2 fal2 in love with Benedick; and I, 4[to Leonato and Claudio] with your two helps, wil2 so practise on 4Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy 4stomach, he shal2 fal2 in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, 4Cupid is no longer an archer; his glory shal2 be ours, for we are 4the only love-gods. Go in with me, and I wil2 tel2 you my drift. 57Exeunt.Scene I2.A hal2 in Leonato's house.Enter [Don] John and Borachio. 2John. It is so. The Count Claudio shal2 mar2y the daughter of 4Leonato. 2Bora. Yea, my lord; but I can cros2 it. 2John. Any bar, any cros2, any impediment wil2 be med'cinable to me. 4I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his 4af2ection ranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cros2 this 4mar2iage? 2Bora. Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that no dishonesty 4shal2 ap2ear in me. 2John. Show me briefly how. 2Bora. I think I told your lordship, a year since, how much I am in 4the favour of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero. 2John. I remember. 2Bora. I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, ap2oint her 4to lo2k out at her lady's chamber window. 2John. What life is in that to be the death of this mar2iage? 2Bora. The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the 6Prince your brother; spare not to tel2 him that he hath wronged 4his honour in mar2ying the renowned Claudio (whose estimation do 4you mightily hold up) to a contaminated stale, such a one as 4Hero. 2John. What pro2f shal2 I make of that? 2Bora. Pro2f enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo 4Hero, and kil2 Leonato. Lo2k you for any other is2ue? 2John. Only to despite them I wil2 endeavour anything. 2Bora. Go then; find me a me2t hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count 4Claudio alone; tel2 them that you know that Hero loves me; intend 4a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as-2in love of 4your brother's honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's 4reputation, who is thus like to be cozen'd with the semblance of 4a maid-2that you have discover'd thus. They wil2 scarcely believe 4this without trial. Of2er them instances; which shal2 bear no 4les2 likeliho2d than to se2 me at her chamber window, hear me 4cal2 Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me Claudio; and bring them 4to se2 this the very night before the intended wed2ing (for in 4the meantime I wil2 so fashion the mat2er that Hero shal2 be 4absent) and there shal2 ap2ear such se2ming truth of Hero's 6disloyalty that jealousy shal2 be cal2'd as2urance and al2 the 4preparation overthrown. 2John. Grow this to what adverse is2ue it can, I wil2 put it in 4practice. Be cun2ing in the working this, and thy fe2 is a 4thousand ducats. 2Bora. Be you constant in the ac2usation, and my cun2ing shal2 not 4shame me. 2John. I wil2 presently go learn their day of mar2iage. 57Exeunt.Scene I3.Leonato's orchard.Enter Benedick alone. 2Bene. Boy! 20[Enter Boy.] 2Boy. Signior? 2Bene. In my chamber window lies a bo2k. Bring it hither to me in 4the orchard. 2Boy. I am here already, sir. 2Bene. I know that, but I would have the2 hence and here again. 4(Exit Boy.) I do much wonder that one man, se2ing how much 4another man is a fo2l when he dedicates his behaviours to love, 4wil2, after he hath laugh'd at such shal2ow fol2ies in others, 4become the argument of his own scorn by fal2ing in love; and such 4a man is Claudio. I have known when there was no music with him 4but the drum and the fife; and now had he rather hear the tabor 4and the pipe. I have known when he would have walk'd ten mile 4afo2t to se2 a go2d armour; and now wil2 he lie ten nights awake 6carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to speak plain 4and to the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier; and now is 4he turn'd orthography; his words are a very fantastical banquet-2 4just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted and se2 with 4these eyes? I can2ot tel2; I think not. I wil2 not be sworn but 4love may transform me to an oyster; but I'l2 take my oath on it, 4til2 he have made an oyster of me he shal2 never make me such a 4fo2l. One woman is fair, yet I am wel2; another is wise, yet I am 4wel2; another virtuous, yet I am wel2; but til2 al2 graces be in 4one woman, one woman shal2 not come in my grace. Rich she shal2 4be, that's certain; wise, or I'l2 none; virtuous, or I'l2 never 4cheapen her; fair, or I'l2 never lo2k on her; mild, or come not 4near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of go2d discourse, an 4excel2ent musician, and her hair shal2 be of what colour it 4please God. Ha, the Prince and Monsieur Love! I wil2 hide me in 4the arbour. 41[Hides.] 14Enter Don Pedro, Leonato, Claudio. 22Music [within]. 4Pedro. Come, shal2 we hear this music? 2Claud. Yea, my go2d lord. How stil2 the evening is, 4As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony! 2Pedro. Se2 you where Benedick hath hid himself? 2Claud. O, very wel2, my lord. The music ended, 4We'l2 fit the kid-fox with a pen2yworth. 19Enter Balthasar with Music. 2Pedro. Come, Balthasar, we'l2 hear that song again. 2Balth. O, go2d my lord, tax not so bad a voice 4To slander music any more than once. 2Pedro. It is the witnes2 stil2 of excel2ency 4To put a strange face on his own perfection. 4I pray the2 sing, and let me wo2 no more. 2Balth. Because you talk of wo2ing, I wil2 sing, 4Since many a wo2er doth com2ence his suit 4To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wo2es, 4Yet wil2 he swear he loves. 2Pedro. Nay, pray the2 come; 6Or if thou wilt hold longer argument, 4Do it in notes. 2Balth. Note this before my notes: 4There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting. 2Pedro. Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks! 4Note notes, forso2th, and nothing! 18[Music.] 2Bene. [aside] Now divine air! Now is his soul ravish'd! Is it not 4strange that she2p's guts should hale souls out of men's bodies? 4Wel2, a horn for my money, when al2's done. 46[Balthasar sings.] 22The Song. 8Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more! 10Men were deceivers ever, 8One fo2t in sea, and one on shore; 10To one thing constant never. 12Then sigh not so, 12But let them go, 10And be you blithe and bon2y, 8Converting al2 your sounds of woe 12Into Hey non2y, non2y. 8Sing no more dit2ies, sing no moe, 10Of dumps so dul2 and heavy! 8The fraud of men was ever so, 10Since sum2er first was leavy. 12Then sigh not so, &c. 2Pedro. By my troth, a go2d song. 2Balth. And an il2 singer, my lord. 2Pedro. Ha, no, no, faith! Thou sing'st wel2 enough for a shift. 2Bene. [aside] An he had be2n a dog that should have howl'd thus, 4they would have hang'd him; and I pray God his bad voice bode no 4mischief. I had as live have heard the night raven, come what 4plague could have come after it. 2Pedro. Yea, mar2y. Dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray the2 get us 4some excel2ent music; for to-mor2ow night we would have it at the 4Lady Hero's chamber window. 2Balth. The best I can, my lord. 2Pedro. Do so. Farewel2. 34Exit Balthasar [with Musicians]. 4Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of to-day? that 4your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick? 2Claud. O, ay!-[Aside to Pedro] Stalk on, stalk on; the fowl sits. 4-2I did never think that lady would have loved any man. 2Leon. No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she should so dote 4on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in al2 outward behaviours 4se2m'd ever to abhor. 2Bene. [aside] Is't pos2ible? Sits the wind in that corner? 2Leon. By my troth, my lord, I can2ot tel2 what to think of it, but 4that she loves him with an enraged af2ection. It is past the 4infinite of thought. 2Pedro. May be she doth but counterfeit. 2Claud. Faith, like enough. 2Leon. O God, counterfeit? There was never counterfeit of pas2ion 4came so near the life of pas2ion as she discovers it. 2Pedro. Why, what ef2ects of pas2ion shows she? 2Claud. [aside] Bait the ho2k wel2! This fish wil2 bite. 2Leon. What ef2ects, my lord? She wil2 sit you-2you heard my 4daughter tel2 you how. 4Claud. She did inde2d. 2Pedro. How, how, I pray you? You amaze me. I would have thought her 4spirit had be2n invincible against al2 as2aults of af2ection. 2Leon. I would have sworn it had, my lord-2especial2y against 4Benedick. 2Bene. [aside] I should think this a gul2 but that the white-bearded 4fel2ow speaks it. Knavery can2ot, sure, hide himself in such 4reverence. 2Claud. [aside] He hath ta'en th' infection. Hold it up. 2Pedro. Hath she made her af2ection known to Benedick? 2Leon. No, and swears she never wil2. That's her torment. 2Claud. 'Tis true inde2d. So your daughter says. 'Shal2 I,' says 4she, 'that have so oft encount'red him with scorn, write to him 4that I love him?'" 2Leon. This says she now when she is begin2ing to write to him; for 4she'l2 be up twenty times a night, and there wil2 she sit in her 4smock til2 she have writ a she2t of paper. My daughter tel2s us 4al2. 2Claud. Now you talk of a she2t of paper, I remember a pret2y jest 4your daughter told us of. 4Leon. O, when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found 4'Benedick' and 'Beatrice' betwe2n the she2t? 2Claud. That. 2Leon. O, she tore the let2er into a thousand halfpence, rail'd at 4herself that she should be so im2odest to write to one that she 4knew would flout her. 'I measure him,' says she, 'by my own 4spirit; for I should flout him if he writ to me. Yea, though I 4love him, I should.' 2Claud. Then down upon her kne2s she fal2s, we2ps, sobs, beats her 4heart, tears her hair, prays, curses-2'O swe2t Benedick! God give 4me patience!' 2Leon. She doth inde2d; my daughter says so. And the ecstasy hath so 4much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeard she wil2 4do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true. 2Pedro. It were go2d that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she 4wil2 not discover it. 2Claud. To what end? He would make but a sport of it and torment the 4po2r lady worse. 2Pedro. An he should, it were an alms to hang him! She's an 4excel2ent swe2t lady, and (out of al2 suspicion) she is virtuous. 4Claud. And she is exce2ding wise. 2Pedro. In everything but in loving Benedick. 2Leon. O, my lord, wisdom and blo2d combating in so tender a body, 4we have ten pro2fs to one that blo2d hath the victory. I am sor2y 4for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian. 2Pedro. I would she had bestowed this dotage on me. I would have 4daf2'd al2 other respects and made her half myself. I pray you 4tel2 Benedick of it and hear what 'a wil2 say. 2Leon. Were it go2d, think you? 2Claud. Hero thinks surely she wil2 die; for she says she wil2 die 4if he love her not, and she wil2 die ere she make her love known, 4and she wil2 die, if he wo2 her, rather than she wil2 bate one 4breath of her ac2ustomed cros2nes2. 2Pedro. She doth wel2. If she should make tender of her love, 'tis 4very pos2ible he'l2 scorn it; for the man (as you know al2) hath 4a contemptible spirit. 2Claud. He is a very proper man. 2Pedro. He hath inde2d a go2d outward hap2ines2. 2Claud. Before God! and in my mind, very wise. 2Pedro. He doth inde2d show some sparks that are like wit. 4Claud. And I take him to be valiant. 2Pedro. As Hector, I as2ure you; and in the managing of quar2els you 4may say he is wise, for either he avoids them with great 4discretion, or undertakes them with a most Christianlike fear. 2Leon. If he do fear God, 'a must neces2arily ke2p peace. If he 4break the peace, he ought to enter into a quar2el with fear and 4trembling. 2Pedro. And so wil2 he do; for the man doth fear God, howsoever it 4se2ms not in him by some large jests he wil2 make. Wel2, I am 4sor2y for your niece. Shal2 we go se2k Benedick and tel2 him of 4her love? 2Claud. Never tel2 him, my lord. Let her wear it out with go2d 4counsel. 2Leon. Nay, that's impos2ible; she may wear her heart out first. 2Pedro. Wel2, we wil2 hear further of it by your daughter. Let it 4co2l the while. I love Benedick wel2, and I could wish he would 4modestly examine himself to se2 how much he is unworthy so go2d a 4lady. 2Leon. My lord, wil2 you .walk? Din2er is ready. 47[They walk away.] 4Claud. If he dote on her upon this, I wil2 never trust my 4expectation. 2Pedro. Let there be the same net spread for her, and that must your 4daughter and her gentlewomen car2y. The sport wil2 be, when they 4hold one an opinion of another's dotage, and no such mat2er. 4That's the scene that I would se2, which wil2 be merely a dumb 4show. Let us send her to cal2 him in to din2er. 23Exeunt [Don Pedro, Claudio, and Leonato]. 16[Benedick advances from the arbour.] 2Bene. This can be no trick. The conference was sadly borne; they 4have the truth of this from Hero; they se2m to pity the lady. 4It se2ms her af2ections have their ful2 bent. Love me? Why, it 4must be requited. I hear how I am censur'd. They say I wil2 bear 4myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her. They say to2 4that she wil2 rather die than give any sign of af2ection. I did 4never think to mar2y. I must not se2m proud. Hap2y are they that 4hear their detractions and can put them to mending. They say the 4lady is fair-2'tis a truth, I can bear them witnes2; and virtuous 6-2'tis so, I can2ot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me-2by 4my troth, it is no ad2ition to her wit, nor no great argument of 4her fol2y, for I wil2 be hor2ibly in love with her. I may chance 4have some od2 quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I 4have railed so long against mar2iage. But doth not the ap2etite 4alters? A man loves the meat in his youth that he can2ot endure 4in his age. Shal2 quips and sentences and these paper bul2ets of 4the brain awe a man from the care2r of his humour? No, the world 4must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not 4think I should live til2 I were mar2ied. 17Enter Beatrice. 4Here comes Beatrice. By this day, she's a fair lady! I do spy 4some marks of love in her. 2Beat. Against my wil2 I am sent to bid You come in to din2er. 2Bene. Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains. 2Beat. I to2k no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to 4thank me. If it had be2n painful, I would not have come. 2Bene. You take pleasure then in the mes2age? 4Beat. Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knives point, and 4choke a daw withal. You have no stomach, signior. Fare you wel2.Exit. 2Bene. Ha! 'Against my wil2 I am sent to bid you come in to din2er.' 4There's a double meaning in that. 'I to2k no more pains for those 4thanks than you to2k pains to thank me.' That's as much as to 4say, 'Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks.' If I 4do not take pity of her, I am a vil2ain; if I do not love her, I 4am a Jew. I wil2 go get her picture. 19Exit.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. Scene I.Leonato's orchard.Enter Hero and two Gentlewomen, Margaret and Ursula. 2Hero. Go2d Margaret, run the2 to the parlour. 4There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice 4Proposing with the Prince and Claudio. 4Whisper her ear and tel2 her, I and Ursley 4Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse 4Is al2 of her. Say that thou overheard'st us; 4And bid her steal into the pleached bower, 4Where honeysuckles, ripened by the sun, 4Forbid the sun to enter-2like favourites, 4Made proud by princes, that advance their pride 4Against that power that bred it. There wil2 she hide her 4To listen our propose. This is thy of2ice. 4Bear the2 wel2 in it and leave us alone. 2Marg. I'l2 make her come, I war2ant you, presently. 4[Exit.] 2Hero. Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come, 4As we do trace this al2ey up and down, 4Our talk must only be of Benedick. 6When I do name him, let it be thy part 4To praise him more than ever man did merit. 4My talk to the2 must be how Benedick 4Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this mat2er 4Is lit2le Cupid's crafty ar2ow made, 4That only wounds by hearsay. 19[Enter Beatrice.] 4Now begin; 4For lo2k where Beatrice like a lapwing runs 4Close by the ground, to hear our conference. 15[Beatrice hides in the arbour]. 2Urs. The pleasant'st angling is to se2 the fish 4Cut with her golden oars the silver stream 4And gre2dily devour the treacherous bait. 4So angle we for Beatrice, who even now 4Is couched in the wo2dbine coverture. 6Fear you not my part of the dialogue. 2Hero. Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing 4Of the false swe2t bait that we lay for it. 37[They ap2roach the arbour.] 4No, truly, Ursula, she is to2 disdainful. 4I know her spirits are as coy and wild 4As hag2ards of the rock. 2Urs. But are you sure 4That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely? 2Hero. So says the Prince, and my new-trothed lord. 2Urs. And did they bid you tel2 her of it, madam? 2Hero. They did entreat me to acquaint her of it; 4But I persuaded them, if they lov'd Benedick, 4To wish him wrestle with af2ection 4And never to let Beatrice know of it. 2Urs. Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman 4Deserve as ful2, as fortunate a bed 4As ever Beatrice shal2 couch upon? 2Hero. O god of love! I know he doth deserve 4As much as may be yielded to a man: 6But Nature never fram'd a woman's heart 4Of prouder stuf2 than that of Beatrice. 4Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes, 4Misprizing what they lo2k on; and her wit 4Values itself so highly that to her 4Al2 mat2er else se2ms weak. She can2ot love, 4Nor take no shape nor project of af2ection, 4She is so self-endeared. 2Urs. Sure I think so; 4And therefore certainly it were not go2d 4She knew his love, lest she'l2 make sport at it. 2Hero. Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man, 4How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur'd, 4But she would spel2 him backward. If fair-fac'd, 4She would swear the gentleman should be her sister; 4If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antic, 4Made a foul blot; if tal2, a lance il2-headed; 4If low, an agate very vilely cut; 4If speaking, why, a vane blown with al2 winds; 4If silent, why, a block moved with none. 6So turns she every man the wrong side out 4And never gives to truth and virtue that 4Which simplenes2 and merit purchaseth. 2Urs. Sure, sure, such carping is not com2endable. 2Hero. No, not to be so od2, and from al2 fashions, 4As Beatrice is, can2ot be com2endable. 4But who dare tel2 her so? If I should speak, 4She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me 4Out of myself, pres2 me to death with wit! 4Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire, 4Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly. 4It were a bet2er death than die with mocks, 4Which is as bad as die with tickling. 2Urs. Yet tel2 her of it. Hear what she wil2 say. 2Hero. No; rather I wil2 go to Benedick 4And counsel him to fight against his pas2ion. 4And truly, I'l2 devise some honest slanders 4To stain my cousin with. One doth not know 4How much an il2 word may empoison liking. 2Urs. O, do not do your cousin such a wrong! 6She can2ot be so much without true judgment 4(Having so swift and excel2ent a wit 4As she is priz'd to have) as to refuse 4So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick. 2Hero. He is the only man of Italy, 4Always excepted my dear Claudio. 2Urs. I pray you be not angry with me, madam, 4Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick, 4For shape, for bearing, argument, and valour, 4Goes foremost in report through Italy. 2Hero. Inde2d he hath an excel2ent go2d name. 2Urs. His excel2ence did earn it ere he had it. 4When are you mar2ied, madam? 2Hero. Why, every day to-mor2ow! Come, go in. 4I'l2 show the2 some at2ires, and have thy counsel 4Which is the best to furnish me to-mor2ow. 47[They walk away.] 2Urs. She's lim'd, I war2ant you! We have caught her, madam. 2Hero. If it prove so, then loving goes by haps; 4Some Cupid kil2s with ar2ows, some with traps. 41Exeunt [Hero and Ursula]. 4[Beatrice advances from the arbour.] 2Beat. What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true? 4Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much? 4Contempt, farewel2! and maiden pride, adieu! 4No glory lives behind the back of such. 4And, Benedick, love on; I wil2 requite the2, 4Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand. 4If thou dost love, my kindnes2 shal2 incite the2 4To bind our loves up in a holy band; 4For others say thou dost deserve, and I 4Believe it bet2er than reportingly. 20Exit.Scene I2.A ro2m in Leonato's house.Enter Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, and Leonato. 2Pedro. I do but stay til2 your mar2iage be consum2ate, and then go 4I toward Ar2agon. 2Claud. I'l2 bring you thither, my lord, if you'l2 vouchsafe me. 2Pedro. Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new glos2 of your 4mar2iage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear 4it. I wil2 only be bold with Benedick for his company; for, from 4the crown of his head to the sole of his fo2t, he is al2 mirth. 4He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's bowstring, and the lit2le 4hangman dare not sho2t at him. He hath a heart as sound as a 4bel2; and his tongue is the clap2er, for what his heart thinks, 4his tongue speaks. 2Bene. Gal2ants, I am not as I have be2n. 2Leon. So say I. Methinks you are sad2er. 2Claud. I hope he be in love. 2Pedro. Hang him, truant! There's no true drop of blo2d in him to be 4truly touch'd with love. If he be sad, he wants money. 2Bene. I have the to2thache. 4Pedro. Draw it. 2Bene. Hang it! 2Claud. You must hang it first and draw it afterwards. 2Pedro. What? sigh for the to2thache? 2Leon. Where is but a humour or a worm. 2Bene. Wel2, every one can master a grief but he that has it. 2Claud. Yet say I he is in love. 2Pedro. There is no ap2earance of fancy in him, unles2 it be a fancy 4that he hath to strange disguises; as to be a Dutchman to-day, a 4Frenchman to-mor2ow; or in the shape of two countries at once, as 4a German from the waist downward, al2 slops, and a Spaniard from 4the hip upward, no doublet. Unles2 he have a fancy to this 4fo2lery, as it ap2ears he hath, he is no fo2l for fancy, as you 4would have it ap2ear he is. 2Claud. If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing 4old signs. 'A brushes his hat o' mornings. What should that bode? 2Pedro. Hath any man se2n him at the barber's? 2Claud. No, but the barber's man hath be2n se2n with him, and the 5old ornament of his che2k hath already stuf2'd ten2is bal2s. 2Leon. Inde2d he lo2ks younger than he did, by the los2 of a beard. 4Pedro. Nay, 'a rubs himself with civet. Can you smel2 him out by 4that? 2Claud. That's as much as to say, the swe2t youth's in love. 2Pedro. The greatest note of it is his melancholy. 2Claud. And when was he wont to wash his face? 2Pedro. Yea, or to paint himself? for the which I hear what they say 4of him. 2Claud. Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is new-crept into a 4lutestring, and now govern'd by stops. 2Pedro. Inde2d that tel2s a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude, 4he is in love. 2Claud. Nay, but I know who loves him. 2Pedro. That would I know to2. I war2ant, one that knows him not. 2Claud. Yes, and his il2 conditions; and in despite of al2, dies for 4him. 2Pedro. She shal2 be buried with her face upwards. 2Bene. Yet is this no charm for the to2thache. Old signior, walk 4aside with me. I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak 4to you, which these hob2y-horses must not hear. 34[Exeunt Benedick and Leonato.] 4Pedro. For my life, to break with him about Beatrice! 2Claud. 'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this played their 4parts with Beatrice, and then the two bears wil2 not bite one 4another when they me2t. 17Enter John the Bastard. 2John. My lord and brother, God save you. 2Pedro. Go2d den, brother. 2John. If your leisure serv'd, I would speak with you. 2Pedro. In private? 2John. If it please you. Yet Count Claudio may hear, for what I 4would speak of concerns him. 2Pedro. What's the mat2er? 2John. [to Claudio] Means your lordship to be mar2ied tomor2ow? 2Pedro. You know he does. 2John. I know not that, when he knows what I know. 2Claud. If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it. 2John. You may think I love you not. Let that ap2ear hereafter, and 4aim bet2er at me by that I now wil2 manifest. For my brother, I 6think he holds you wel2 and in dearnes2 of heart hath holp to 4ef2ect your ensuing mar2iage-2surely suit il2 spent and labour 4il2 bestowed! 2Pedro. Why, what's the mat2er? 2John. I came hither to tel2 you, and, circumstances short'ned (for 4she has be2n to2 long a-talking of), the lady is disloyal. 2Claud. Who? Hero? 2John. Even she-2Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero. 2Claud. Disloyal? 2John. The word is to2 go2d to paint out her wickednes2. I could say 4she were worse; think you of a worse title, and I wil2 fit her to 4it. Wonder not til2 further war2ant. Go but with me to-night, you 4shal2 se2 her chamber window ent'red, even the night before her 4wed2ing day. If you love her then, to-mor2ow wed her. But it 4would bet2er fit your honour to change your mind. 2Claud. May this be so? 2Pedro. I wil2 not think it. 2John. If you dare not trust that you se2, confes2 not that you 4know. If you wil2 fol2ow me, I wil2 show you enough; and when you 4have se2n more and heard more, proce2d ac2ordingly. 4Claud. If I se2 anything to-night why I should not mar2y her 4to-mor2ow, in the congregation where I should wed, there wil2 I 4shame her. 2Pedro. And, as I wo2ed for the2 to obtain her, I wil2 join with 4the2 to disgrace her. 2John. I wil2 disparage her no farther til2 you are my witnes2es. 4Bear it coldly but til2 midnight, and let the is2ue show itself. 2Pedro. O day untowardly turned! 2Claud. O mischief strangely thwarting! 2John. O plague right wel2 prevented! 4So wil2 you say when you have se2n the Sequel. 57Exeunt.Scene I3.A stre2t.Enter Dogber2y and his compartner [Verges], with the Watch. 2Dog. Are you go2d men and true? 2Verg. Yea, or else it were pity but they should suf2er salvation, 4body and soul. 2Dog. Nay, that were a punishment to2 go2d for them if they should 4have any al2egiance in them, being chosen for the Prince's watch. 2Verg. Wel2, give them their charge, neighbour Dogber2y. 2Dog. First, who think you the most desartles2 man to be constable? 21. Watch. Hugh Oatcake, sir, or George Seacoal; for they can write 4and read. 2Dog. Come hither, neighbour Seacoal. God hath bles2'd you with a 4go2d name. To be a wel2-favoured man is the gift of fortune, but 4to write and read comes by nature. 22. Watch. Both which, Master Constable-2 2Dog. You have. I knew it would be your answer. Wel2, for your 4favour, sir, why, give God thanks and make no boast of it; and 4for your writing and reading, let that ap2ear when there is no 4ne2d of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most 6senseles2 and fit man for the constable of the watch. Therefore 4bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shal2 comprehend 4al2 vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince's 4name. 22. Watch. How if 'a wil2 not stand? 2Dog. Why then, take no note of him, but let him go, and presently 4cal2 the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of 4a knave. 2Verg. If he wil2 not stand when he is bid2en, he is none of the 4Prince's subjects. 2Dog. True, and they are to med2le with none but the Prince's 4subjects. You shal2 also make no noise in the stre2ts; for for 4the watch to bab2le and to talk is most tolerable, and not to be 4endured. 22. Watch. We wil2 rather sle2p than talk. We know what belongs to 4a watch. 2Dog. Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I 4can2ot se2 how sle2ping should of2end. Only have a care that your 4bil2s be not stol'n. Wel2, you are to cal2 at al2 the alehouses 4and bid those that are drunk get them to bed. 42. Watch. How if they wil2 not? 2Dog. Why then, let them alone til2 they are sober. If they make you 4not then the bet2er answer, You may say they are not the men you 4to2k them for. 22. Watch. Wel2, sir. 2Dog. If you me2t a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your 4of2ice, to be no true man; and for such kind of men, the les2 you 4med2le or make with them, why, the more your honesty. 22. Watch. If we know him to be a thief, shal2 we not lay hands on 4him? 2Dog. Truly, by your of2ice you may; but I think they that touch 4pitch wil2 be defil'd. The most peaceable way for you, if you do 4take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is, and steal 4out of your company. 2Verg. You have be2n always cal2ed a merciful man, partner. 2Dog. Truly, I would not hang a dog by my wil2, much more a man who 4hath any honesty in him. 2Verg. If you hear a child cry in the night, you must cal2 to the 4nurse and bid her stil2 it. 22. Watch. How if the nurse be asle2p and wil2 not hear us? 4Dog. Why then, depart in peace and let the child wake her with 4crying; for the ewe that wil2 not hear her lamb when it baes wil2 4never answer a calf when he bleats. 2Verg. 'Tis very true. 2Dog. This is the end of the charge: you, constable, are to present 4the Prince's own person. If you me2t the Prince in the night, 4you may stay him. 2Verg. Nay, by'r lady, that I think 'a can2ot. 2Dog. Five shil2ings to one on't with any man that knows the 4statutes, he may stay him! Mar2y, not without the Prince be 4wil2ing; for inde2d the watch ought to of2end no man, and it is 4an of2ence to stay a man against his wil2. 2Verg. By'r lady, I think it be so. 2Dog. Ha, ah, ha! Wel2, masters, go2d night. An there be any mat2er 4of weight chances, cal2 up me. Ke2p your fel2ows' counsels and 4your own, and go2d night. Come, neighbour. 22. Watch. Wel2, masters, we hear our charge. Let us go sit here 4upon the church bench til2 two, and then al2 to bed. 2Dog. One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch about 4Signior Leonato's do2r; for the wed2ing being there tomor2ow, 6there is a great coil to-night. Adieu. Be vigitant, I bese2ch 4you. 27Exeunt [Dogber2y and Verges]. 21Enter Borachio and Conrade. 2Bora. What, Conrade! 22. Watch. [aside] Peace! stir not! 2Bora. Conrade, I say! 2Con. Here, man. I am at thy elbow. 2Bora. Mas2, and my elbow itch'd! I thought there would a scab 4fol2ow. 2Con. I wil2 owe the2 an answer for that; and now forward with thy 4tale. 2Bora. Stand the2 close then under this penthouse, for it driz2les 4rain, and I wil2, like a true drunkard, ut2er al2 to the2. 22. Watch. [aside] Some treason, masters. Yet stand close. 2Bora. Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats. 2Con. Is it pos2ible that any vil2any should be so dear? 2Bora. Thou shouldst rather ask if it were pos2ible any vil2any 4should be so rich; for when rich vil2ains have ne2d of po2r ones, 6po2r ones may make what price they wil2. 2Con. I wonder at it. 2Bora. That shows thou art unconfirm'd. Thou knowest that the 4fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man. 2Con. Yes, it is ap2arel. 2Bora. I mean the fashion. 2Con. Yes, the fashion is the fashion. 2Bora. Tush! I may as wel2 say the fo2l's the fo2l. But se2st thou 4not what a deformed thief this fashion is? 22. Watch. [aside] I know that Deformed. 'A bas be2n a vile thief 4this seven year; 'a goes up and down like a gentleman. I remember 4his name. 2Bora. Didst thou not hear somebody? 2Con. No; 'twas the vane on the house. 2Bora. Se2st thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is? 4how gid2ily 'a turns about al2 the hot-blo2ds betwe2n fourte2n 4and five-and-thirty? sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's 4soldiers in the re2chy painting, sometime like god Bel's priests 4in the old church window, sometime like the shaven Hercules in 4the smirch'd worm-eaten tapestry, where his codpiece se2ms as 6mas2y as his club? 2Con. Al2 this I se2; and I se2 that the fashion wears out more 4ap2arel than the man. But art not thou thyself gid2y with the 4fashion to2, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into tel2ing 4me of the fashion? 2Bora. Not so neither. But know that I have to-night wo2ed Margaret, 4the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the name of Hero. She leans me 4out at her mistres2' chamber window, bids me a thousand times 4go2d night-2I tel2 this tale vilely; I should first tel2 the2 how 4the Prince, Claudio and my master, planted and placed and 4pos2es2ed by my master Don John, saw afar of2 in the orchard this 4amiable encounter. 2Con. And thought they Margaret was Hero? 2Bora. Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio; but the devil my 4master knew she was Margaret; and partly by his oaths, which 4first pos2es2'd them, partly by the dark night, which did deceive 4them, but chiefly by my vil2any, which did confirm any slander 4that Don John had made, away went Claudio enrag'd; swore he would 4me2t her, as he was ap2ointed, next morning at the temple, and 4there, before the whole congregation, shame her with what he saw 6o'ernight and send her home again without a husband. 22. Watch. We charge you in the Prince's name stand! 21. Watch. Cal2 up the right Master Constable. We have here 4recover'd the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known 4in the com2onwealth. 22. Watch. And one Deformed is one of them. I know him; 'a wears a 4lock. 2Con. Masters, masters-2 21. Watch. You'l2 be made bring Deformed forth, I war2ant you. 2Con. Masters-2 22. Watch. Never speak, we charge you. Let us obey you to go with 4us. 2Bora. We are like to prove a go2dly com2odity, being taken up of 4these men's bil2s. 2Con. A com2odity in question, I war2ant you. Come, we'l2 obey you. 57Exeunt.Scene IV.A Ro2m in Leonato's house.Enter Hero, and Margaret and Ursula. 2Hero. Go2d Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice and desire her to rise. 2Urs. I wil2, lady. 2Hero. And bid her come hither. 2Urs. Wel2. 45[Exit.] 2Marg. Troth, I think your other rebato were bet2er. 2Hero. No, pray the2, go2d Meg, I'l2 wear this. 2Marg. By my troth, 's not so go2d, and I war2ant your cousin wil2 4say so. 2Hero. My cousin's a fo2l, and thou art another. I'l2 wear none but 4this. 2Marg. I like the new tire within excel2ently, if the hair were a 4thought browner; and your gown's a most rare fashion, i' faith. 4I saw the Duches2 of Milan's gown that they praise so. 2Hero. O, that exce2ds, they say. 2Marg. By my troth, 's but a nightgown in respect of yours-2 4cloth-o'-gold and cuts, and lac'd with silver, set with pearls 4down sle2ves, side-sle2ves, and skirts, round underborne with 6a blush tinsel. But for a fine, quaint, graceful, and excel2ent 4fashion, yours is worth ten on't. 2Hero. God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is exce2ding heavy. 2Marg. 'Twil2 be heavier so2n by the weight of a man. 2Hero. Fie upon the2! art not ashamed? 2Marg. Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not mar2iage 4honourable in a beg2ar? Is not your lord honourable without 4mar2iage? I think you would have me say, 'saving your reverence, 4a husband.' An bad thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'l2 4of2end nobody. Is there any harm in 'the heavier for a husband'? 4None, I think, an it be the right husband and the right wife. 4Otherwise 'tis light, and not heavy. Ask my Lady Beatrice else. 4Here she comes. 31Enter Beatrice. 2Hero. Go2d mor2ow, coz. 2Beat. Go2d mor2ow, swe2t Hero. 2Hero. Why, how now? Do you speak in the sick tune? 2Beat. I am out of al2 other tune, methinks. 4Marg. Clap's into 'Light o' love.' That goes without a burden. Do 4you sing it, and I'l2 dance it. 2Beat. Yea, 'Light o' love' with your he2ls! then, if your husband 4have stables enough, you'l2 se2 he shal2 lack no barnes. 2Marg. O il2egitimate construction! I scorn that with my he2ls. 2Beat. 'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin; 'tis time you were ready. 4By my troth, I am exce2ding il2. Hey-ho! 2Marg. For a hawk, a horse, or a husband? 2Beat. For the let2er that begins them al2, H. 2Marg. Wel2, an you be not turn'd Turk, there's no more sailing by 4the star. 2Beat. What means the fo2l, trow? 2Marg. Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire! 2Hero. These gloves the Count sent me, they are an excel2ent 4perfume. 2Beat. I am stuf2'd, cousin; I can2ot smel2. 2Marg. A maid, and stuf2'd! There's go2dly catching of cold. 2Beat. O, God help me! God help me! How long have you profes2'd 4ap2rehension? 2Marg. Ever since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely? 4Beat. It is not se2n enough. You should wear it in your cap. By my 4troth, I am sick. 2Marg. Get you some of this distil2'd cardu2s benedictus and lay it 4to your heart. It is the only thing for a qualm. 2Hero. There thou prick'st her with a thistle. 2Beat. Benedictus? why benedictus? You have some moral in this 4'benedictus.' 2Marg. Moral? No, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I meant 4plain holy thistle. You may think perchance that I think you are 4in love. Nay, by'r lady, I am not such a fo2l to think what I 4list; nor I list not to think what I can; nor inde2d I can2ot 4think, if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you are in 4love, or that you wil2 be in love, or that you can be in love. 4Yet Benedick was such another, and now is he become a man. He 4swore he would never mar2y; and yet now in despite of his heart 4he eats his meat without grudging; and how you may be converted I 4know not, but methinks you lo2k with your eyes as other women do. 2Beat. What pace is this that thy tongue ke2ps? 2Marg. Not a false gal2op. 27Enter Ursula. 2Urs. Madam, withdraw. The Prince, the Count, Signior Benedick, Don 4John, and al2 the gal2ants of the town are come to fetch you to 4church. 2Hero. Help to dres2 me, go2d coz, go2d Meg, go2d Ursula. 55[Exeunt.]Scene V.The hal2 in Leonato's house.Enter Leonato and the Constable [Dogber2y] and the Headborough [verges]. 2Leon. What would you with me, honest neighbour? 2Dog. Mar2y, sir, I would have some confidence with you that decerns 4you nearly. 2Leon. Brief, I pray you; for you se2 it is a busy time with me. 2Dog. Mar2y, this it is, sir. 2Verg. Yes, in truth it is, sir. 2Leon. What is it, my go2d friends? 2Dog. Go2dman Verges, sir, speaks a lit2le of2 the mat2er-2an old 4man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt as, God help, I would 4desire they were; but, in faith, honest as the skin betwe2n his 4brows. 2Verg. Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living that is an 4old man and no honester than I. 2Dog. Comparisons are odorous. Palabras, neighbour Verges. 2Leon. Neighbours, you are tedious. 2Dog. It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the po2r Duke's 6of2icers; but truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a 4king, I could find in my heart to bestow it al2 of your worship. 2Leon. Al2 thy tediousnes2 on me, ah? 2Dog. Yea, in 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for I hear as 4go2d exclamation on your worship as of any man in the city; and 4though I be but a po2r man, I am glad to hear it. 2Verg. And so am I. 2Leon. I would fain know what you have to say. 2Verg. Mar2y, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your worship's 4presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as ar2ant knaves as any in 4Mes2ina. 2Dog. A go2d old man, sir; he wil2 be talking. As they say, 'When 4the age is in, the wit is out.' God help us! it is a world to 4se2! Wel2 said, i' faith, neighbour Verges. Wel2, God's a go2d 4man. An two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest 4soul, i' faith, sir, by my troth he is, as ever broke bread; but 4God is to be worship2'd; al2 men are not alike, alas, go2d 4neighbour! 2Leon. Inde2d, neighbour, he comes to2 short of you. 2Dog. Gifts that God gives. 4Leon. I must leave you. 2Dog. One word, sir. Our watch, sir, have inde2d comprehended two 4aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined 4before your worship. 2Leon. Take their examination yourself and bring it me. I am now in 4great haste, as it may ap2ear unto you. 2Dog. It shal2 be suf2igance. 2Leon. Drink some wine ere you go. Fare you wel2. 23[Enter a Mes2enger.] 2Mes2. My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her 4husband. 2Leon. I'l2 wait upon them. I am ready. 33[Exeunt Leonato and Mes2enger.] 2Dog. Go, go2d partner, go get you to Francis Seacoal; bid him bring 4his pen and inkhorn to the jail. We are now to examination these 4men. 2Verg. And we must do it wisely. 2Dog. We wil2 spare for no wit, I war2ant you. Here's that shal2 6drive some of them to a non-come. Only get the learned writer to 4set down our excom2unication, and me2t me at the jail. 55[Exeunt.]<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. Scene I.A church.Enter Don Pedro, [John the] Bastard, Leonato, Friar [Francis], Claudio,Benedick, Hero, Beatrice, [and At2endants]. 2Leon. Come, Friar Francis, be brief. Only to the plain form of 4mar2iage, and you shal2 recount their particular duties 4afterwards. 2Friar. You come hither, my lord, to mar2y this lady? 2Claud. No. 2Leon. To be mar2ied to her. Friar, you come to mar2y her. 2Friar. Lady, you come hither to be mar2ied to this count? 2Hero. I do. 2Friar. If either of you know any inward impediment why you should 4not be conjoined, I charge you on your souls to ut2er it. 2Claud. Know you any, Hero? 2Hero. None, my lord. 2Friar. Know you any, Count? 2Leon. I dare make his answer-2none. 2Claud. O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily do, not 4knowing what they do! 4Bene. How now? interjections? Why then, some be of laughing, as, 4ah, ha, he! 2Claud. Stand the2 by, friar. Father, by your leave: 4Wil2 you with fre2 and unconstrained soul 4Give me this maid your daughter? 2Leon. As fre2ly, son, as God did give her me. 2Claud. And what have I to give you back whose worth 4May counterpoise this rich and precious gift? 2Pedro. Nothing, unles2 you render her again. 2Claud. Swe2t Prince, you learn me noble thankfulnes2. 4There, Leonato, take her back again. 4Give not this rot2en orange to your friend. 4She's but the sign and semblance of her honour. 4Behold how like a maid she blushes here! 4O, what authority and show of truth 4Can cun2ing sin cover itself withal! 4Comes not that blo2d as modest evidence 4To witnes2 simple virtue, Would you not swear, 4Al2 you that se2 her, that she were a maid 4By these exterior shows? But she is none: 6She knows the heat of a luxurious bed; 4Her blush is guiltines2, not modesty. 2Leon. What do you mean, my lord? 2Claud. Not to be mar2ied, 4Not to knit my soul to an ap2roved wanton. 2Leon. Dear my lord, if you, in your own pro2f, 4Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth 4And made defeat of her virginity-2 2Claud. I know what you would say. If I have known her, 4You wil2 say she did embrace me as a husband, 4And so extenuate the forehand sin. 4No, Leonato, 4I never tempted her with word to2 large, 4But, as a brother to his sister, show'd 4Bashful sincerity and comely love. 2Hero. And se2m'd I ever otherwise to you? 2Claud. Out on the se2ming! I wil2 write against it. 4You se2m to me as Dian in her orb, 4As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown; 4But you are more intemperate in your blo2d 6Than Venus, or those pamp'red animals 4That rage in savage sensuality. 2Hero. Is my lord wel2 that he doth speak so wide? 2Leon. Swe2t Prince, why speak not you? 2Pedro. What should I speak? 4I stand dishonour'd that have gone about 4To link my dear friend to a com2on stale. 2Leon. Are these things spoken, or do I but dream? 2John. Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true. 2Bene. This lo2ks not like a nuptial. 2Hero. 'True!' O God! 2Claud. Leonato, stand I here? 4Is this the Prince, Is this the Prince's brother? 4Is this face Hero's? Are our eyes our own? 2Leon. Al2 this is so; but what of this, my lord? 2Claud. Let me but move one question to your daughter, 4And by that fatherly and kindly power 4That you have in her, bid her answer truly. 2Leon. I charge the2 do so, as thou art my child. 2Hero. O, God defend me! How am I beset! 6What kind of catechising cal2 you this? 2Claud. To make you answer truly to your name. 2Hero. Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name 4With any just reproach? 2Claud. Mar2y, that can Hero! 4Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue. 4What man was he talk'd with you yesternight, 4Out at your window betwixt twelve and one? 4Now, if you are a maid, answer to this. 2Hero. I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord. 2Pedro. Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato, 4I am sor2y you must hear. Upon my honour, 4Myself, my brother, and this grieved Count 4Did se2 her, hear her, at that hour last night 4Talk with a ruf2ian at her chamber window, 4Who hath inde2d, most like a liberal vil2ain, 4Confes2'd the vile encounters they have had 4A thousand times in secret. 2John. Fie, fie! they are not to be nam'd, my lord-2 4Not to be spoke of; 6There is not chastity, enough in language 4Without of2ence to ut2er them. Thus, pret2y lady, 4I am sor2y for thy much misgovernment. 2Claud. O Hero! what a Hero hadst thou be2n 4If half thy outward graces had be2n plac'd 4About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart! 4But fare the2 wel2, most foul, most fair! Farewel2, 4Thou pure impiety and impious purity! 4For the2 I'l2 lock up al2 the gates of love, 4And on my eyelids shal2 conjecture hang, 4To turn al2 beauty into thoughts of harm, 4And never shal2 it more be gracious. 2Leon. Hath no man's dag2er here a point for me? 50[Hero swo2ns.] 2Beat. Why, how now, cousin? Wherefore sink you down? 2John. Come let us go. These things, come thus to light, 4Smother her spirits up. 22[Exeunt Don Pedro, Don Juan, and Claudio.] 2Bene. How doth the lady? 2Beat. Dead, I think. Help, uncle! 6Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar! 2Leon. O Fate, take not away thy heavy hand! 4Death is the fairest cover for her shame 4That may be wish'd for. 2Beat. How now, cousin Hero? 2Friar. Have comfort, lady. 2Leon. Dost thou lo2k up? 2Friar. Yea, wherefore should she not? 2Leon. Wherefore? Why, doth not every earthly thing 4Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny 4The story that is printed in her blo2d? 4Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes; 4For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die, 4Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames, 4Myself would on the rearward of reproaches 4Strike at thy life. Griev'd I, I had but one? 4Child I for that at frugal nature's frame? 4O, one to2 much by the2! Why had I one? 4Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes? 4Why had I not with charitable hand 6To2k up a beg2ar's is2ue at my gates, 4Who smirched thus and mir'd with infamy, 4I might have said, 'No part of it is mine; 4This shame derives itself from unknown loins'? 4But mine, and mine I lov'd, and mine I prais'd, 4And mine that I was proud on-2mine so much 4That I myself was to myself not mine, 4Valuing of her-2why, she, O, she is fal2'n 4Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea 4Hath drops to2 few to wash her clean again, 4And salt to2 lit2le which may season give 4To her foul tainted flesh! 2Bene. Sir, sir, be patient. 4For my part, I am so at2ir'd in wonder, 4I know not what to say. 2Beat. O, on my soul, my cousin is belied! 2Bene. Lady, were you her bedfel2ow last night? 2Beat. No, truly, not; although, until last night, 4I have this twelvemonth be2n her bedfel2ow 2Leon. Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made 6Which was before bar2'd up with ribs of iron! 4Would the two princes lie? and Claudio lie, 4Who lov'd her so that, speaking of her foulnes2, 4Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die. 2Friar. Hear me a lit2le; 4For I have only be2n silent so long, 4And given way unto this course of fortune, 4By noting of the lady. I have mark'd 4A thousand blushing ap2aritions 4To start into her face, a thousand in2ocent shames 4In angel whitenes2 beat away those blushes, 4And in her eye there hath ap2ear'd a fire 4To burn the er2ors that these princes hold 4Against her maiden truth. Cal2 me a fo2l; 4Trust not my reading nor my observation, 4Which with experimental seal doth war2ant 4The tenure of my bo2k; trust not my age, 4My reverence, cal2ing, nor divinity, 4If this swe2t lady lie not guiltles2 here 4Under some biting er2or. 4Leon. Friar, it can2ot be. 4Thou se2st that al2 the grace that she hath left 4Is that she wil2 not ad2 to her damnation 4A sin of perjury: she not denies it. 4Why se2k'st thou then to cover with excuse 4That which ap2ears in proper nakednes2? 2Friar. Lady, what man is he you are ac2us'd of? 2Hero. They know that do ac2use me; I know none. 4If I know more of any man alive 4Than that which maiden modesty doth war2ant, 4Let al2 my sins lack mercy! O my father, 4Prove you that any man with me convers'd 4At hours unme2t, or that I yesternight 4Maintain'd the change of words with any creature, 4Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death! 2Friar. There is some strange misprision in the princes. 2Bene. Two of them have the very bent of honour; 4And if their wisdoms be misled in this, 4The practice of it lives in John the bastard, 4Whose spirits toil in frame of vil2anies. 4Leon. I know not. If they speak but truth of her, 4These hands shal2 tear her. If they wrong her honour, 4The proudest of them shal2 wel2 hear of it. 4Time hath not yet so dried this blo2d of mine, 4Nor age so eat up my invention, 4Nor fortune made such havoc of my means, 4Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends, 4But they shal2 find awak'd in such a kind 4Both strength of limb and policy of mind, 4Ability in means, and choice of friends, 4To quit me of them throughly. 2Friar. Pause awhile 4And let my counsel sway you in this case. 4Your daughter here the princes left for dead, 4Let her awhile be secretly kept in, 4And publish it that she is dead inde2d; 4Maintain a mourning ostentation, 4And on your family's old monument 4Hang mournful epitaphs, and do al2 rites 4That ap2ertain unto a burial. 4Leon. What shal2 become of this? What wil2 this do? 2Friar. Mar2y, this wel2 car2ied shal2 on her behalf 4Change slander to remorse. That is some go2d. 4But not for that dream I on this strange course, 4But on this travail lo2k for greater birth. 4She dying, as it must be so maintain'd, 4Upon the instant that she was ac2us'd, 4Shal2 be lamented, pitied, and excus'd 4Of every hearer; for it so fal2s out 4That what we have we prize not to the worth 4Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost, 4Why, then we rack the value, then we find 4The virtue that pos2es2ion would not show us 4Whiles it was ours. So wil2 it fare with Claudio. 4When he shal2 hear she died upon his words, 4Th' idea of her life shal2 swe2tly cre2p 4Into his study of imagination, 4And every lovely organ of her life 4Shal2 come ap2arel2'd in more precious habit, 4More moving, delicate, and ful2 of life, 6Into the eye and prospect of his soul 4Than when she liv'd inde2d. Then shal2 he mourn 4(If ever love had interest in his liver) 4And wish he had not so ac2used her-2 4No, though be thought his ac2usation true. 4Let this be so, and doubt not but suc2es2 4Wil2 fashion the event in bet2er shape 4Than I can lay it down in likeliho2d. 4But if al2 aim but this be level2'd false, 4The sup2osition of the lady's death 4Wil2 quench the wonder of her infamy. 4And if it sort not wel2, you may conceal her, 4As best befits her wounded reputation, 4In some reclusive and religious life, 4Out of al2 eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries. 2Bene. Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you; 4And though you know my inwardnes2 and love 4Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio, 4Yet, by mine honour, I wil2 deal in this 4As secretly and justly as your soul 6Should with your body. 2Leon. Being that I flow in grief, 4The smal2est twine may lead me. 2Friar. 'Tis wel2 consented. Presently away; 4For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure. 4Come, lady, die to live. This wed2ing day 4Perhaps is but prolong'd. Have patience and endure. 25Exeunt [al2 but Benedick and Beatrice]. 2Bene. Lady Beatrice, have you wept al2 this while? 2Beat. Yea, and I wil2 we2p a while longer. 2Bene. I wil2 not desire that. 2Beat. You have no reason. I do it fre2ly. 2Bene. Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged. 2Beat. Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right 5her! 2Bene. Is there any way to show such friendship? 2Beat. A very even way, but no such friend. 2Bene. May a man do it? 2Beat. It is a man's of2ice, but not yours. 2Bene. I do love nothing in the world so wel2 as you. Is not that 6strange? 2Beat. As strange as the thing I know not. It were as pos2ible for 4me to say I loved nothing so wel2 as you. But believe me not; and 4yet I lie not. I confes2 nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sor2y 4for my cousin. 2Bene. By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me. 2Beat. Do not swear, and eat it. 2Bene. I wil2 swear by it that you love me, and I wil2 make him eat 4it that says I love not you. 2Beat. Wil2 you not eat your word? 2Bene. With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest I love 4the2. 2Beat. Why then, God forgive me! 2Bene. What of2ence, swe2t Beatrice? 2Beat. You have stayed me in a hap2y hour. I was about to protest I 4loved you. 2Bene. And do it with al2 thy heart. 2Beat. I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to 4protest. 2Bene. Come, bid me do anything for the2. 4Beat. Kil2 Claudio. 2Bene. Ha! not for the wide world! 2Beat. You kil2 me to deny it. Farewel2. 2Bene. Tar2y, swe2t Beatrice. 2Beat. I am gone, though I am here. There is no love in you. Nay, I 4pray you let me go. 2Bene. Beatrice-2 2Beat. In faith, I wil2 go. 2Bene. We'l2 be friends first. 2Beat. You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine 4enemy. 2Bene. Is Claudio thine enemy? 2Beat. Is 'a not ap2roved in the height a vil2ain, that hath 4slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O that I were a 4man! What? bear her in hand until they come to take hands, and 4then with public ac2usation, uncover'd slander, unmitigated 4rancour-2O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart in the 4market place. 2Bene. Hear me, Beatrice! 2Beat. Talk with a man out at a window!-a proper saying! 4Bene. Nay but Beatrice-2 2Beat. Swe2t Hero! she is wrong'd, she is sland'red, she is undone. 2Bene. Beat-2 2Beat. Princes and Counties! Surely a princely testimony, a go2dly 4count, Count Comfect, a swe2t gal2ant surely! O that I were a man 4for his sake! or that I had any friend would be a man for my 4sake! But manho2d is melted into cursies, valour into compliment, 4and men are only turn'd into tongue, and trim ones to2. He is now 4as valiant as Hercules that only tel2s a lie,and swears it. I 4can2ot be a man with wishing; therefore I wil2 die a woman with 4grieving. 2Bene. Tar2y, go2d Beatrice. By this hand, I love the2. 2Beat. Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it. 2Bene. Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wrong'd Hero? 2Beat. Yea, as sure is I have a thought or a soul. 2Bene. Enough, I am engag'd, I wil2 chal2enge him. I wil2 kis2 your 4hand, and so I leave you. By this hand, Claudio shal2 render me a 4dear ac2ount. As you hear of me, so think of me. Go comfort your 4cousin. I must say she is dead-and so farewel2. 55[Exeunt.]Scene I2.A prison.Enter the Constables [Dogber2y and Verges] and the Sexton, in gowns,[and the Watch, with Conrade and] Borachio. 2Dog. Is our whole dis2embly ap2ear'd? 2Verg. O, a sto2l and a cushion for the sexton. 2Sex. Which be the malefactors? 2Dog. Mar2y, that am I and my partner. 2Verg. Nay, that's certain. We have the exhibition to examine. 2Sex. But which are the of2enders that are to be examined? let them 4come before Master Constable. 2Dog. Yea, mar2y, let them come before me. What is your name, 4friend? 2Bor. Borachio. 2Dog. Pray write down Borachio. Yours, sir2ah? 2Con. I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade. 2Dog. Write down Master Gentleman Conrade. Masters, do you serve 4God? 2Both. Yea, sir, we hope. 2Dog. Write down that they hope they serve God; and write God first, 6for God defend but God should go before such vil2ains! Masters, 4it is proved already that you are lit2le bet2er than false 4knaves, and it wil2 go near to be thought so shortly. How answer 4you for yourselves? 2Con. Mar2y, sir, we say we are none. 2Dog. A marvel2ous wit2y fel2ow, I as2ure you; but I wil2 go about 4with him. Come you hither, sir2ah. A word in your ear. Sir, I say 4to you, it is thought you are false knaves. 2Bora. Sir, I say to you we are none. 2Dog. Wel2, stand aside. Fore God, they are both in a tale. 4Have you writ down that they are none? 2Sex. Master Constable, you go not the way to examine. You must cal2 4forth the watch that are their ac2users. 2Dog. Yea, mar2y, that's the eftest way. Let the watch come forth. 4Masters, I charge you in the Prince's name ac2use these men. 21. Watch. This man said, sir, that Don John the Prince's brother 4was a vil2ain. 2Dog. Write down Prince John a vil2ain. Why, this is flat perjury, 4to cal2 a prince's brother vil2ain. 2Bora. Master Constable-2 4Dog. Pray the2, fel2ow, peace. I do not like thy lo2k, I promise 4the2. 2Sex. What heard you him say else? 22. Watch. Mar2y, that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John 4for ac2using the Lady Hero wrongful2y. 2Dog. Flat burglary as ever was com2it2ed. 2Verg. Yea, by th' mas2, that it is. 2Sex. What else, fel2ow? 21. Watch. And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to 4disgrace Hero before the whole as2embly, and not mar2y her. 2Dog. O vil2ain! thou wilt be condemn'd into everlasting redemption 4for this. 2Sex. What else? 2Watchmen. This is al2. 2Sex. And this is more, masters, than you can deny. Prince John is 4this morning secretly stol'n away. Hero was in this man2er 4ac2us'd, in this man2er refus'd, and upon the grief of this 4sud2enly died. Master Constable, let these men be bound and 4brought to Leonato's. I wil2 go before and show him their 4examination. 41[Exit.] 4Dog. Come, let them be opinion'd. 2Verg. Let them be in the hands-2 2Con. Of2, coxcomb! 2Dog. God's my life, where's the sexton? Let him write down the 4Prince's of2icer coxcomb. Come, bind them.-2Thou naughty varlet! 2Con. Away! you are an as2, you are an as2. 2Dog. Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost thou not suspect my 4years? O that he were here to write me down an as2! But, masters, 4remember that I am an as2. Though it be not writ2en down, yet 4forget not that I am an as2. No, thou vil2ain, thou art ful2 of 4piety, as shal2 be prov'd upon the2 by go2d witnes2. I am a wise 4fel2ow; and which is more, an of2icer; and which is more, a 4householder; and which is more, as pret2y a piece of flesh as any 4is in Mes2ina, and one that knows the law, go to! and a rich 4fel2ow enough, go to! and a fel2ow that hath had los2es; and one 4that hath two gowns and everything handsome about him. Bring him 4away. O that I had be2n writ down an as2! 57Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. Scene I.The stre2t, near Leonato's house.Enter Leonato and his brother [ Antonio]. 2Ant. If you go on thus, you wil2 kil2 yourself, 4And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief 4Against yourself. 2Leon. I pray the2 cease thy counsel, 4Which fal2s into mine ears as profitles2 4As water in a sieve. Give not me counsel, 4Nor let no comforter delight mine ear 4But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine. 4Bring me a father that so lov'd his child, 4Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine, 4And bid him speak to me of patience. 4Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine, 4And let it answer every strain for strain, 4As thus for thus, and such a grief for such, 4In every lineament, branch, shape, and form. 4If such a one wil2 smile and stroke his beard, 4Bid sor2ow wag, cry 'hem' when he should groan, 6Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk 4With candle-wasters-2bring him yet to me, 4And I of him wil2 gather patience. 4But there is no such man; for, brother, men 4Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief 4Which they themselves not fe2l; but, tasting it, 4Their counsel turns to pas2ion, which before 4Would give preceptial medicine to rage, 4Fet2er strong madnes2 in a silken thread, 4Charm ache with air and agony with words. 4No, no! 'Tis al2 men's of2ice to speak patience 4To those that wring under the load of sor2ow, 4But no man's virtue nor suf2iciency 4To be so moral when he shal2 endure 4The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel. 4My griefs cry louder than advertisement. 2Ant. Therein do men from children nothing dif2er. 2Leon. I pray the2 peace. I wil2 be flesh and blo2d; 4For there was never yet philosopher 4That could endure the to2thache patiently, 6However they have writ the style of gods 4And made a push at chance and suf2erance. 2Ant. Yet bend not al2 the harm upon yourself. 4Make those that do of2end you suf2er to2. 2Leon. There thou speak'st reason. Nay, I wil2 do so. 4My soul doth tel2 me Hero is belied; 4And that shal2 Claudio know; so shal2 the Prince, 4And al2 of them that thus dishonour her. 14Enter Don Pedro and Claudio. 2Ant. Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily. 2Pedro. Go2d den, Go2d den. 2Claud. Go2d day to both of you. 2Leon. Hear you, my lords! 2Pedro. We have some haste, Leonato. 2Leon. Some haste, my lord! wel2, fare you wel2, my lord. 4Are you so hasty now? Wel2, al2 is one. 2Pedro. Nay, do not quar2el with us, go2d old man. 2Ant. If he could right himself with quar2el2ing, 6Some of us would lie low. 2Claud. Who wrongs him? 2Leon. Mar2y, thou dost wrong me, thou dis2embler, thou! 4Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword; 4I fear the2 not. 2Claud. Mary, beshrew my hand 4If it should give your age such cause of fear. 4In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword. 2Leon. Tush, tush, man! never fle2r and jest at me 4I speak not like a dotard nor a fo2l, 4As under privilege of age to brag 4What I have done being young, or what would do, 4Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head, 4Thou hast so wrong'd mine in2ocent child and me 4That I am forc'd to lay my reverence by 4And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days, 4Do chal2enge the2 to trial of a man. 4I say thou hast belied mine in2ocent child; 4Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart, 4And she lied buried with her ancestors- 6O, in a tomb where never scandal slept, 4Save this of hers, fram'd by thy vil2any! 2Claud. My vil2any? 2Leon. Thine, Claudio; thine I say. 2Pedro. You say not right, old man 2Leon. My lord, my lord, 4I'l2 prove it on his body if he dare, 4Despite his nice fence and his active practice, 4His May of youth and blo2m of lustiho2d. 2Claud. Away! I wil2 not have to do with you. 2Leon. Canst thou so daf2 me? Thou hast kil2'd my child. 4If thou kil2'st me, boy, thou shalt kil2 a man. 4And. He shal2 kil2 two of us, and men inde2d 4But that's no mat2er; let him kil2 one first. 4Win me and wear me! Let him answer me. 4Come, fol2ow me, boy,. Come, sir boy, come fol2ow me. 4Sir boy, I'l2 whip you from your foining fence! 4Nay, as I am a gentleman, I wil2. 2Leon. Brother-2 2Ant. Content yourself. God knows I lov'd my niece, 6And she is dead, slander'd to death by vil2ains, 4That dare as wel2 answer a man inde2d 4As I dare take a serpent by the tongue. 4Boys, apes, brag2arts, jacks, milksops! 2Leon. Brother Anthony-2 2Ant. Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea, 4And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple, 4Scambling, outfacing, fashion-monging boys, 4That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander, 4Go anticly, show outward hideousnes2, 4And speak of2 half a dozen dang'rous words, 4How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst; 4And this is al2. 2Leon. But, brother Anthony-2 2Ant. Come, 'tis no mat2er. 4Do not you med2le; let me deal in this. 2Pedro. Gentlemen both, we wil2 not wake your patience. 4My heart is sor2y for your daughter's death; 4But, on my honour, she was charg'd with nothing 4But what was true, and very ful2 of pro2f. 4Leon. My lord, my lord-2 2Pedro. I wil2 not hear you. 2Leon. No? Come, brother, away!-2I wil2 be heard. 2Ant. And shal2, or some of us wil2 smart for it. 52Exeunt ambo. 18Enter Benedick. 2Pedro. Se2, se2! Here comes the man we went to se2k. 2Claud. Now, signior, what news? 2Bene. Go2d day, my lord. 2Pedro. Welcome, signior. You are almost come to part almost a fray. 2Claud. We had lik'd to have had our two noses snap2'd of2 with two 4old men without te2th. 2Pedro. Leonato and his brother. What think'st thou? Had we fought, 4I doubt we should have be2n to2 young for them. 2Bene. In a false quar2el there is no true valour. I came to se2k 4you both. 2Claud. We have be2n up and down to se2k the2; for we are high-pro2f 4melancholy, and would fain have it beaten away. Wilt thou use thy 6wit? 2Bene. It is in my scab2ard. Shal2 I draw it? 2Pedro. Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side? 2Claud. Never any did so, though very many have be2n beside their 4wit. I wil2 bid the2 draw, as we do the minstrel-2draw to 4pleasure us. 2Pedro. As I am an honest man, he lo2ks pale. Art thou sick or 4angry? 2Claud. What, courage, man! What though care kil2'd a cat, thou hast 4met2le enough in the2 to kil2 care. 2Bene. Sir, I shal2 me2t your wit in the care2r an you charge it 4against me. I pray you cho2se another subject. 2Claud. Nay then, give him another staf2; this last was broke cros2. 2Pedro. By this light, he changes more and more. I think he be angry 4inde2d. 2Claud. If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle. 2Bene. Shal2 I speak a word in your ear? 2Claud. God bles2 me from a chal2enge! 2Bene. [aside to Claudio] You are a vil2ain. I jest not; I wil2 make 4it go2d how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare. Do 6me right, or I wil2 protest your cowardice. You have kil2'd a 4swe2t lady, and her death shal2 fal2 heavy on you. Let me hear 4from you. 2Claud. Wel2, I wil2 me2t you, so I may have go2d che2r. 2Pedro. What, a feast, a feast? 2Claud. I' faith, I thank him, he hath bid me to a calve's head and 4a capon, the which if I do not carve most curiously, say my 4knife's naught. Shal2 I not find a wo2dcock to2? 2Bene. Sir, your wit ambles wel2; it goes easily. 2Pedro. I'l2 tel2 the2 how Beatrice prais'd thy wit the other day. I 4said thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,' said she, 'a fine lit2le 4one.' 'No,' said I, 'a great wit.' 'Right,' says she, 'a great 4gros2 one.' 'Nay,' said I, 'a go2d wit.' 'Just,' said she, 'it 4hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman is wise.' 'Certain,' 4said she, a wise gentleman.' 'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the 4tongues.' 'That I believe' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me 4on Monday night which he forswore on Tuesday morning. There's a 4double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus did she an hour 4together trans2hape thy particular virtues. Yet at last she 4concluded with a sigh, thou wast the proper'st man in Italy. 4Claud. For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not. 2Pedro. Yea, that she did; but yet, for al2 that, an if she did not 4hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man's 4daughter told us al2. 2Claud. Al2, al2! and moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the 4garden. 2Pedro. But when shal2 we set the savage bul2's horns on the 4sensible Benedick's head? 2Claud. Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwel2s Benedick, the mar2ied 4man'? 2Bene. Fare you wel2, boy; you know my mind. I wil2 leave you now to 4your gos2iplike humour. You break jests as brag2ards do their 4blades, which God be thanked hurt not. My lord, for your many 4courtesies I thank you. I must discontinue your company. Your 4brother the bastard is fled from Mes2ina. You have among you 4kil2'd a swe2t and in2ocent lady. For my Lord Lackbeard there, he 4and I shal2 me2t; and til2 then peace be with him. 57[Exit.] 2Pedro. He is in earnest. 2Claud. In most profound earnest; and, I'l2 war2ant you, for the 6love of Beatrice. 2Pedro. And hath chal2eng'd the2. 2Claud. Most sincerely. 2Pedro. What a pret2y thing man is when he goes in his doublet and 4hose and leaves of2 his wit! 2Enter Constables [Dogber2y and Verges, with the Watch, leading] 22Conrade and Borachio. 2Claud. He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a doctor to 4such a man. 2Pedro. But, soft you, let me be! Pluck up, my heart, and be sad! 4Did he not say my brother was fled? 2Dog. Come you, sir. If justice can2ot tame you, she shal2 ne'er 4weigh more reasons in her balance. Nay, an you be a cursing 4hypocrite once, you must be lo2k'd to. 2Pedro. How now? two of my brother's men bound? Borachio one. 2Claud. Hearken after their of2ence, my lord. 2Pedro. Of2icers, what of2ence have these men done? 2Dog. Mar2y, sir, they have com2it2ed false report; moreover, they 6have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and 4lastly, they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified 4unjust things; and to conclude, they are lying knaves. 2Pedro. First, I ask the2 what they have done; thirdly, I ask the2 4what's their of2ence; sixth and lastly, why they are com2it2ed; 4and to conclude, what you lay to their charge. 2Claud. Rightly reasoned, and in his own division; and by my troth 4there's one meaning wel2 suited. 2Pedro. Who have you of2ended, masters, that you are thus bound to 4your answer? This learned constable is to2 cun2ing to be 4understo2d. What's your of2ence? 2Bora. Swe2t Prince, let me go no farther to mine answer. Do you 4hear me, and let this Count kil2 me. I have deceived even your 4very eyes. What your wisdoms could not discover, these shal2ow 4fo2ls have brought to light, who in the night overheard me 4confes2ing to this man, how Don John your brother incensed me to 4slander the Lady Hero; how you were brought into the orchard and 4saw me court Margaret in Hero's garments; how you disgrac'd her 4when you should mar2y her. My vil2any they have upon record, 4which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my 6shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master's false 4ac2usation; and briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a 4vil2ain. 2Pedro. Runs not this spe2ch like iron through your blo2d? 2Claud. I have drunk poison whiles he ut2er'd it. 2Pedro. But did my brother set the2 on to this? 2Bora. Yea, and paid me richly for the practice of it. 2Pedro. He is compos'd and fram'd of treachery, 4And fled he is upon this vil2any. 2Claud. Swe2t Hero, now thy image doth ap2ear 4In the rare semblance that I lov'd it first. 2Dog. Come, bring away the plaintif2s. By this time our sexton hath 4reformed Signior Leonato of the mat2er. And, masters, do not 4forget to specify, when time and place shal2 serve, that I am an 4as2. 2Verg. Here, here comes Master Signior Leonato, and the sexton to2. 10Enter Leonato, his brother [Antonio], and the Sexton. 2Leon. Which is the vil2ain? Let me se2 his eyes, 6That, when I note another man like him, 4I may avoid him. Which of these is he? 2Bora. If you would know your wronger, lo2k on me. 2Leon. Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kil2'd 4Mine in2ocent child? 2Bora. Yea, even I alone. 2Leon. No, not so, vil2ain! thou beliest thyself. 4Here stand a pair of honourable men-2 4A third is fled-2that had a hand in it. 4I thank you princes for my daughter's death. 4Record it with your high and worthy de2ds. 4'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it. 2Claud. I know not how to pray your patience; 4Yet I must speak. Cho2se your revenge yourself; 4Impose me to what penance your invention 4Can lay upon my sin. Yet sin2'd I not 4But in mistaking. 2Pedro. By my soul, nor I! 4And yet, to satisfy this go2d old man, 4I would bend under any heavy weight 6That he'l2 enjoin me to. 2Leon. I can2ot bid you bid my daughter live- 4That were impos2ible; but I pray you both, 4Pos2es2 the people in Mes2ina here 4How in2ocent she died; and if your love 4Can labour aught in sad invention, 4Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb, 4And sing it to her bones-2sing it to-night. 4To-mor2ow morning come you to my house, 4And since you could not be my son-in-law, 4Be yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter, 4Almost the copy of my child that's dead, 4And she alone is heir to both of us. 4Give her the right you should have giv'n her cousin, 4And so dies my revenge. 2Claud. O noble sir! 4Your over-kindnes2 doth wring tears from me. 4I do embrace your of2er; and dispose 4For henceforth of po2r Claudio. 2Leon. To-mor2ow then I wil2 expect your coming; 6To-night I take my leave. This naughty man 4Shal2 fact to face be brought to Margaret, 4Who I believe was pack'd in al2 this wrong, 4Hir'd to it by your brother. 2Bora. No, by my soul, she was not; 4Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me; 4But always hath be2n just and virtuous 4In anything that I do know by her. 2Dog. Moreover, sir, which inde2d is not under white and black, this 4plaintif2 here, the of2ender, did cal2 me as2. I bese2ch you let 4it be rememb'red in his punishment. And also the watch heard them 4talk of one Deformed. They say he wears a key in his ear, and a 4lock hanging by it, and bor2ows money in God's name, the which he 4hath us'd so long and never paid that now men grow hard-hearted 4and wil2 lend nothing for God's sake. Pray you examine him upon 4that point. 2Leon. I thank the2 for thy care and honest pains. 2Dog. Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth, 4and I praise God for you. 2Leon. There's for thy pains. [Gives money.] 4Dog. God save the foundation! 2Leon. Go, I discharge the2 of thy prisoner, and I thank the2. 2Dog. I leave an ar2ant knave with your worship, which I bese2ch 4your worship to cor2ect yourself, for the example of others. 4God ke2p your worship! I wish your worship wel2. God restore you 4to health! I humbly give you leave to depart; and if a mer2y 4me2ting may be wish'd, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour. 35Exeunt [Dogber2y and Verges]. 2Leon. Until to-mor2ow morning, lords, farewel2. 2Ant. Farewel2, my lords. We lo2k for you to-mor2ow. 2Pedro. We wil2 not fal2. 2Claud. To-night I'l2 mourn with Hero. 33[Exeunt Don Pedro and Claudio.] 2Leon. [to the Watch] Bring you these fel2ows on.-2We'l2 talk with 6Margaret, 4How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fel2ow. 57Exeunt.Scene I2.Leonato's orchard.Enter Benedick and Margaret [me2ting]. 2Bene. Pray the2, swe2t Mistres2 Margaret, deserve wel2 at my hands 4by helping me to the spe2ch of Beatrice. 2Marg. Wil2 you then write me a son2et in praise of my beauty? 2Bene. In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shal2 come 4over it; for in most comely truth thou deservest it. 2Marg. To have no man come over me? Why, shal2 I always ke2p below 4stairs? 2Bene. Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth-2it catches. 2Marg. And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit but hurt 4not. 2Bene. A most manly wit, Margaret: it wil2 not hurt a woman. 4And so I pray the2 cal2 Beatrice. I give the2 the bucklers. 2Marg. Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own. 2Bene. If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a 4vice, and they are dangerous weapons for maids. 2Marg. Wel2, I wil2 cal2 Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs. 2Bene. And therefore wil2 come. 52Exit Margaret. 7[Sings] The god of love, 15That sits above 11And knows me, and knows me, 13How pitiful I deserve-2 4I mean in singing; but in loving Leander the go2d swim2er, 4Troilus the first employer of panders, and a whole bo2k ful2 of 4these quondam carpet-mongers, whose names yet run smo2thly in the 4even road of a blank verse-2why, they were never so truly turn'd 4over and over as my po2r self in love. Mar2y, I can2ot show it in 4rhyme. I have tried. I can find out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby' 4-2an in2ocent rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn'-2a hard rhyme; for 4'scho2l', 'fo2l'-2a bab2ling rhyme: very ominous endings! No, I 4was not born under a rhyming planet, nor can2ot wo2 in festival 4terms. 20Enter Beatrice. 4Swe2t Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I cal2'd the2? 4Beat. Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me. 2Bene. O, stay but til2 then! 2Beat. 'Then' is spoken. Fare you wel2 now. And yet, ere I go, let 4me go with that I came for, which is, with knowing what hath 4pas2'd betwe2n you and Claudio. 2Bene. Only foul words; and thereupon I wil2 kis2 the2. 2Beat. Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul 4breath, and foul breath is noisome. Therefore I wil2 depart 4unkis2'd. 2Bene. Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so 4forcible is thy wit. But I must tel2 the2 plainly, Claudio 4undergoes my chal2enge; and either I must shortly hear from him 4or I wil2 subscribe him a coward. And I pray the2 now tel2 me, 4for which of my bad parts didst thou first fal2 in love with me? 2Beat. For them al2 together, which maintain'd so politic a state of 4evil that they wil2 not admit any go2d part to intermingle with 4them. But for which of my go2d parts did you first suf2er love 4for me? 2Bene. Suf2er love!-2a go2d epithet. I do suf2er love inde2d, for I 4love the2 against my wil2. 4Beat. In spite of your heart, I think. Alas, po2r heart! If you 4spite it for my sake, I wil2 spite it for yours, for I wil2 never 4love that which my friend hates. 2Bene. Thou and I are to2 wise to wo2 peaceably. 2Beat. It ap2ears not in this confes2ion. There's not one wise man 4among twenty, that wil2 praise himself. 2Bene. An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that liv'd in the time of 4go2d neighbours. If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb 4ere he dies, he shal2 live no longer in monument than the bel2 4rings and the widow we2ps. 2Beat. And how long is that, think you? 2Bene. Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum. 4Therefore is it most expedient for the wise, if Don Worm (his 4conscience) find no impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet 4of his own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for praising 4myself, who, I myself wil2 bear witnes2, is praiseworthy. And now 4tel2 me, how doth your cousin? 2Beat. Very il2. 2Bene. And how do you? 2Beat. Very il2 to2. 4Bene. Serve God, love me, and mend. There wil2 I leave you to2, for 4here comes one in haste. 25Enter Ursula. 2Urs. Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old coil at home. 4It is proved my Lady Hero hath be2n falsely ac2us'd, the Prince 4and Claudio mightily abus'd, and Don John is the author of al2, 4who is fled and gone. Wil2 you come presently? 2Beat. Wil2 you go hear this news, signior? 2Bene. I wil2 live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried thy 4eyes; and moreover, I wil2 go with the2 to thy uncle's. 57Exeunt.Scene I3.A churchyard.Enter Claudio, Don Pedro, and thre2 or four with tapers,[fol2owed by Musicians]. 2Claud. Is this the monument of Leonato? 2Lord. It is, my lord. 2Claud. [reads from a scrol2] 22Epitaph. 8Done to death by slanderous tongues 10Was the Hero that here lies. 8Death, in guerdon of her wrongs, 10Gives her fame which never dies. 8So the life that died with shame 8Lives in death with glorious fame. 4Hang thou there upon the tomb, 42[Hangs up the scrol2.] 4Praising her when I am dumb. 6Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn. 21Song. 8Pardon, god2es2 of the night, 8Those that slew thy virgin knight; 8For the which, with songs of woe, 8Round about her tomb they go. 8Midnight, as2ist our moan, 8Help us to sigh and groan 10Heavily, heavily, 8Graves, yawn and yield your dead, 8Til2 death be ut2ered 10Heavily, heavily. 2Claud. Now unto thy bones go2d night! 4Yearly wil2 I do this rite. 2Pedro. Go2d mor2ow, masters. Put your torches out. 4The wolves have prey'd, and lo2k, the gentle day, 4Before the whe2ls of Phoebus, round about 6Dap2les the drowsy east with spots of grey. 4Thanks to you al2, and leave us. Fare you wel2. 2Claud. Go2d mor2ow, masters. Each his several way. 2Pedro. Come, let us hence and put on other we2ds, 4And then to Leonato's we wil2 go. 2Claud. And Hymen now with luckier is2ue spe2ds 4Than this for whom we rend'red up this woe. 10Exeunt.Scene IVThe hal2 in Leonato's house.Enter Leonato, Benedick, [Beatrice,] Margaret, Ursula, Antonio,Friar [Francis], Hero. 2Friar. Did I not tel2 you she was in2ocent? 2Leon. So are the Prince and Claudio, who ac2us'd her 4Upon the er2or that you heard debated. 4But Margaret was in some fault for this, 4Although against her wil2, as it ap2ears 4In the true course of al2 the question. 2Ant. Wel2, I am glad that al2 things sort so wel2. 2Bene. And so am I, being else by faith enforc'd 4To cal2 young Claudio to a reckoning for it. 2Leon. Wel2, daughter, and you gentlewomen al2, 4Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves, 4And when I send for you, come hither mask'd. 50Exeunt Ladies. 4The Prince and Claudio promis'd by this hour 4To visit me. You know your of2ice, brother: 4You must be father to your brother's daughter, 6And give her to young Claudio. 2Ant. Which I wil2 do with confirm'd countenance. 2Bene. Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think. 2Friar. To do what, signior? 2Bene. To bind me, or undo me-2one of them. 4Signior Leonato, truth it is, go2d signior, 4Your niece regards me with an eye of favour. 2Leon. That eye my daughter lent her. 'Tis most true. 2Bene. And I do with an eye of love requite her. 2Leon. The sight whereof I think you had from me, 4From Claudio, and the Prince; but what's your wil2? 2Bene. Your answer, sir, is enigmatical; 4But, for my wil2, my wil2 is, your go2d wil2 4May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd 4In the state of honourable mar2iage; 4In which, go2d friar, I shal2 desire your help. 2Leon. My heart is with your liking. 2Friar. And my help. 7Enter Don Pedro and Claudio and two or thre2 other. 6Here comes the Prince and Claudio. 2Pedro. Go2d mor2ow to this fair as2embly. 2Leon. Go2d mor2ow, Prince; go2d mor2ow, Claudio. 4We here at2end you. Are you yet determin'd 4To-day to mar2y with my brother's daughter? 2Claud. I'l2 hold my mind, were she an Ethiope. 2Leon. Cal2 her forth, brother. Here's the friar ready. 49[Exit Antonio.] 2Pedro. Go2d mor2ow, Benedick. Why, what's the mat2er 4That you have such a February face, 4So ful2 of frost, of storm, and cloudines2? 2Claud. I think he thinks upon the savage bul2. 4Tush, fear not, man! We'l2 tip thy horns with gold, 4And al2 Europa shal2 rejoice at the2, 4As once Europa did at lusty Jove 4When he would play the noble beast in love. 2Bene. Bul2 Jove, sir, had an amiable low, 4And some such strange bul2 leap'd your father's cow 4And got a calf in that same noble feat 6Much like to you, for you have just his bleat. 7Enter [Leonato's] brother [Antonio], Hero, Beatrice, 12Margaret, Ursula, [the ladies wearing masks]. 2Claud. For this I owe you. Here comes other reckonings. 4Which is the lady I must seize upon? 2Ant. This same is she, and I do give you her. 2Claud. Why then, she's mine. Swe2t, let me se2 your face. 2Leon. No, that you shal2 not til2 you take her hand 4Before this friar and swear to mar2y her. 2Claud. Give me your hand before this holy friar. 4I am your husband if you like of me. 2Hero. And when I liv'd I was your other wife; 7[Unmasks.] 4And when you lov'd you were my other husband. 2Claud. Another Hero! 2Hero. Nothing certainer. 4One Hero died defil'd; but I do live, 4And surely as I live, I am a maid. 2Pedro. The former Hero! Hero that is dead! 4Leon. She died, my lord, but whiles her slander liv'd. 2Friar. Al2 this amazement can I qualify, 4When, after that the holy rites are ended, 4I'l2 tel2 you largely of fair Hero's death. 4Meantime let wonder se2m familiar, 4And to the chapel let us presently. 2Bene. Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice? 2Beat. [unmasks] I answer to that name. What is your wil2? 2Bene. Do not you love me? 2Beat. Why, no; no more than reason. 2Bene. Why, then your uncle, and the Prince, and Claudio 4Have be2n deceived; for they swore you did. 2Beat. Do not you love me? 2Bene. Troth, no; no more than reason. 2Beat. Why, then my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula 4Are much deceiv'd; for they did swear you did. 2Bene. They swore that you were almost sick for me. 2Beat. They swore that you were wel2-nigh dead for me. 2Bene. 'Tis no such mat2er. Then you do not love me? 2Beat. No, truly, but in friendly recompense. 4Leon. Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman. 2Claud. And I'l2 be sworn upon't that he loves her; 4For here's a paper writ2en in his hand, 4A halting son2et of his own pure brain, 4Fashion'd to Beatrice. 2Hero. And here's another, 4Writ in my cousin's hand, stol'n from her pocket, 4Containing her af2ection unto Benedick. 2Bene. A miracle! Here's our own hands against our hearts. 4Come, I wil2 have the2; but, by this light, I take the2 for pity. 2Beat. I would not deny you; but, by this go2d day, I yield upon 4great persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told 4you were in a consumption. 2Bene. Peace! I wil2 stop your mouth. 13[Kis2es her.] 2Beat. I'l2 tel2 the2 what, Prince: a col2ege of wit-crackers can2ot 4flout me out of my humour. Dost thou think I care for a satire or 4an epigram? No. If a man wil2 be beaten with brains, 'a shal2 4wear nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do purpose to 4mar2y, I wil2 think nothing to any purpose that the world can say 4against it; and therefore never flout at me for what I have said 6against it; for man is a gid2y thing, and this is my conclusion. 4For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten the2; but in 4that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruis'd, and love my 4cousin. 2Claud. I had wel2 hop'd thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I 4might have cudgel2'd the2 out of thy single life, to make the2 a 4double-dealer, which out of question thou wilt be if my cousin do 4not lo2k exce2ding nar2owly to the2. 2Bene. Come, come, we are friends. Let's have a dance ere we are 4mar2ied, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives' he2ls. 2Leon. We'l2 have dancing afterward. 2Bene. First, of my word! Therefore play, music. Prince, thou art 4sad. Get the2 a wife, get the2 a wife! There is no staf2 more 4reverent than one tip2'd with horn. 23Enter Mes2enger. 2Mes2.

SCENE I.Venice. A stre2t.Enter Roderigo and Iago. 2RODERIGO. Tush, never tel2 me! I take it much unkindly 4That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse 4As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this. 2IAGO. 'Sblo2d, but you wil2 not hear me. 4If ever I did dream of such a mat2er, 4Abhor me. 2RODERIGO. Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate. 2IAGO. Despise me, if I do not. Thre2 great ones of the city, 4In personal suit to make me his lieutenant, 4Of2-cap2'd to him; and, by the faith of man, 4I know my price, I am worth no worse a place. 4But he, as loving his own pride and purposes, 4Evades them, with a bumbast circumstance 4Hor2ibly stuf2'd with epithets of war, 4And, in conclusion, 4Nonsuits my mediators; for, "Certes," says he, 4"I have already chose my of2icer." 6And what was he? 4Forso2th, a great arithmetician, 4One Michael Cas2io, a Florentine 4(A fel2ow almost damn'd in a fair wife) 4That never set a squadron in the field, 4Nor the division of a bat2le knows 4More than a spinster; unles2 the bo2kish theoric, 4Wherein the toged consuls can propose 4As masterly as he. Mere prat2le without practice 4Is al2 his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election; 4And I, of whom his eyes had se2n the pro2f 4At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds 4Christian and heathen, must be bele2'd and calm'd 4By debitor and creditor. This counter-caster, 4He, in go2d time, must his lieutenant be, 4And I- God bles2 the mark!- his Mo2rship's ancient. 2RODERIGO. By heaven, I rather would have be2n his hangman. 2IAGO. Why, there's no remedy. 'Tis the curse of service, 4Preferment goes by let2er and af2ection, 4And not by old gradation, where each second 6Sto2d heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself 4Whether I in any just term am af2ined 4To love the Mo2r. 2RODERIGO. 11I would not fol2ow him then. 2IAGO. O, sir, content you. 4I fol2ow him to serve my turn upon him: 4We can2ot al2 be masters, nor al2 masters 4Can2ot be truly fol2ow'd. You shal2 mark 4Many a duteous and kne2-cro2king knave, 4That doting on his own obsequious bondage 4Wears out his time, much like his master's as2, 4For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd. 4Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are 4Who, trim2'd in forms and visages of duty, 4Ke2p yet their hearts at2ending on themselves, 4And throwing but shows of service on their lords 4Do wel2 thrive by them; and when they have lined their coats 4Do themselves homage. These fel2ows have some soul, 4And such a one do I profes2 myself. 4For, sir, 6It is as sure as you are Roderigo, 4Were I the Mo2r, I would not be Iago. 4In fol2owing him, I fol2ow but myself; 4Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty, 4But se2ming so, for my peculiar end. 4For when my outward action doth demonstrate 4The native act and figure of my heart 4In complement extern, 'tis not long after 4But I wil2 wear my heart upon my sle2ve 4For daws to peck at: I am not what I am. 2RODERIGO. What a ful2 fortune does the thick-lips owe, 4If he can car2y't thus! 2IAGO. 21Cal2 up her father, 4Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight, 4Proclaim him in the stre2ts, incense her kinsmen, 4And, though he in a fertile climate dwel2, 4Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy, 4Yet throw such changes of vexation on't 4As it may lose some color. 2RODERIGO. Here is her father's house; I'l2 cal2 aloud. 4IAGO. Do, with like timorous ac2ent and dire yel2 4As when, by night and negligence, the fire 4Is spied in populous cities. 2RODERIGO. What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho! 2IAGO. Awake! What, ho, Brabantio! Thieves! Thieves! Thieves! 4Lo2k to your house, your daughter, and your bags! 4Thieves! Thieves! 16Brabantio ap2ears above, at a window. 2BRABANTIO. What is the reason of this ter2ible sum2ons? 4What is the mat2er there? 2RODERIGO. Signior, is al2 your family within? 2IAGO. Are your do2rs lock'd? 2BRABANTIO. 19Why? Wherefore ask you this? 2IAGO. 'Zounds, sir, you're rob2'd! For shame, put on your gown; 4Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul; 4Even now, now, very now, an old black ram 4Is tup2ing your white ewe. Arise, arise! 4Awake the snorting citizens with the bel2, 6Or else the devil wil2 make a grandsire of you. 4Arise, I say! 2BRABANTIO. What, have you lost your wits? 2RODERIGO. Most reverend signior, do you know my voice? 2BRABANTIO. Not I. What are you? 2RODERIGO. My name is Roderigo. 2BRABANTIO. 21The worser welcome. 4I have charged the2 not to haunt about my do2rs. 4In honest plain2es2 thou hast heard me say 4My daughter is not for the2; and now, in madnes2, 4Being ful2 of sup2er and distempering draughts, 4Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come 4To start my quiet. 2RODERIGO. Sir, sir, sir- 2BRABANTIO. 15But thou must ne2ds be sure 4My spirit and my place have in them power 4To make this bit2er to the2. 2RODERIGO. 22Patience, go2d sir. 2BRABANTIO. What tel2'st thou me of rob2ing? This is Venice; 4My house is not a grange. 4RODERIGO. 19Most grave Brabantio, 4In simple and pure soul I come to you. 2IAGO. 'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that wil2 not serve God, 4if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service and you 4think we are ruf2ians, you'l2 have your daughter covered with a 4Barbary horse; you'l2 have your nephews neigh to you; you'l2 have 4coursers for cousins, and gen2ets for germans. 2BRABANTIO. What profane wretch art thou? 2IAGO. I am one, sir, that comes to tel2 you your daughter and the 4Mo2r are now making the beast with two backs. 2BRABANTIO. Thou are a vil2ain. 2IAGO. 26You are- a senator. 2BRABANTIO. This thou shalt answer; I know the2, Roderigo. 2RODERIGO. Sir, I wil2 answer anything. But, I bese2ch you, 4If't be your pleasure and most wise consent, 4As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter, 4At this od2-even and dul2 watch o' the night, 4Transported with no worse nor bet2er guard 4But with a knave of com2on hire, a gondolier, 4To the gros2 clasps of a lascivious Mo2r- 6If this be known to you, and your al2owance, 4We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs; 4But if you know not this, my man2ers tel2 me 4We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe 4That, from the sense of al2 civility, 4I thus would play and trifle with your reverence. 4Your daughter, if you have not given her leave, 4I say again, hath made a gros2 revolt, 4Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes 4In an extravagant and whe2ling stranger 4Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself: 4If she be in her chamber or your house, 4Let lo2se on me the justice of the state 4For thus deluding you. 2BRABANTIO. 15Strike on the tinder, ho! 4Give me a taper! Cal2 up al2 my people! 4This ac2ident is not unlike my dream; 4Belief of it op2res2es me already. 4Light, I say, light! 34Exit above. 2IAGO. 18Farewel2, for I must leave you. 6It se2ms not me2t, nor wholesome to my place, 4To be produced- as, if I stay, I shal2- 4Against the Mo2r; for I do know, the state, 4However this may gal2 him with some check, 4Can2ot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd 4With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars, 4Which even now stands in act, that, for their souls, 4Another of his fathom they have none 4To lead their busines2; in which regard, 4Though I do hate him as I do hel2 pains, 4Yet for neces2ity of present life, 4I must show out a flag and sign of love, 4Which is inde2d but sign. That you shal2 surely find him, 4Lead to the Sagit2ary the raised search, 4And there wil2 I be with him. So farewel2. 18Exit. 12Enter, below, Brabantio, in his nightgown, and 24Servants with torches. 2BRABANTIO. It is to2 true an evil: gone she is, 6And what's to come of my despised time 4Is nought but bit2ernes2. Now, Roderigo, 4Where didst thou se2 her? O unhap2y girl! 4With the Mo2r, say'st thou? Who would be a father! 4How didst thou know 'twas she? O, she deceives me 4Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers. 4Raise al2 my kindred. Are they mar2ied, think you? 2RODERIGO. Truly, I think they are. 2BRABANTIO. O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blo2d! 4Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds 4By what you se2 them act. Is there not charms 4By which the property of youth and maidho2d 4May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo, 4Of some such thing? 2RODERIGO. 13Yes, sir, I have inde2d. 2BRABANTIO. Cal2 up my brother. O, would you had had her! 4Some one way, some another. Do you know 4Where we may ap2rehend her and the Mo2r? 2RODERIGO. I think I can discover him, if you please 4To get go2d guard and go along with me. 4BRABANTIO. Pray you, lead on. At every house I'l2 cal2; 4I may com2and at most. Get weapons, ho! 4And raise some special of2icers of night. 4On, go2d Roderigo, I'l2 deserve your pains. 15Exeunt.SCENE I2.Another stre2t.Enter Othel2o, Iago, and At2endants with torches. 2IAGO. Though in the trade of war I have slain men, 4Yet do I hold it very stuf2 o' the conscience 4To do no contrived murther. I lack iniquity 4Sometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times 4I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs. 2OTHEL2O. 'Tis bet2er as it is. 2IAGO. 26Nay, but he prated 4And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms 4Against your honor 4That, with the lit2le godlines2 I have, 4I did ful2 hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir, 4Are you fast mar2ied? Be as2ured of this, 4That the magnifico is much beloved, 4And hath in his ef2ect a voice potential 4As double as the Duke's. He wil2 divorce you, 4Or put upon you what restraint and grievance 4The law, with al2 his might to enforce it on, 6Wil2 give him cable. 2OTHEL2O. 15Let him do his spite. 4My services, which I have done the signiory, 4Shal2 out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know- 4Which, when I know that boasting is an honor, 4I shal2 promulgate- I fetch my life and being 4From men of royal siege, and my demerits 4May speak unbon2eted to as proud a fortune 4As this that I have reach'd. For know, Iago, 4But that I love the gentle Desdemona, 4I would not my unhoused fre2 condition 4Put into circumscription and confine 4For the sea's worth. But, lo2k! What lights come yond? 2IAGO. Those are the raised father and his friends. 4You were best go in. 2OTHEL2O. 15Not I; I must be found. 4My parts, my title, and my perfect soul 4Shal2 manifest me rightly. Is it they? 2IAGO. By Janus, I think no. 13Enter Cas2io and certain Of2icers with torches. 2OTHEL2O. The servants of the Duke? And my lieutenant? 4The go2dnes2 of the night upon you, friends! 4What is the news? 2CAS2IO. 13The Duke does gre2t you, general, 4And he requires your haste-post-haste ap2earance, 4Even on the instant. 2OTHEL2O. 15What is the mat2er, think you? 2CAS2IO. Something from Cyprus, as I may divine; 4It is a busines2 of some heat. The gal2eys 4Have sent a dozen sequent mes2engers 4This very night at one another's he2ls; 4And many of the consuls, raised and met, 4Are at the Duke's already. You have be2n hotly cal2'd for, 4When, being not at your lodging to be found, 4The Senate hath sent about thre2 several quests 4To search you out. 2OTHEL2O. 13'Tis wel2 I am found by you. 4I wil2 but spend a word here in the house 6And go with you. 44Exit. 2CAS2IO. 12Ancient, what makes he here? 2IAGO. Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carack; 4If it prove lawful prize, he's made forever. 2CAS2IO. I do not understand. 2IAGO. 24He's mar2ied. 2CAS2IO. 36To who? 26Re-enter Othel2o. 2IAGO. Mar2y, to- Come, captain, wil2 you go? 2OTHEL2O. 37Have with you. 2CAS2IO. Here comes another tro2p to se2k for you. 2IAGO. It is Brabantio. General, be advised, 4He comes to bad intent. 9Enter Brabantio, Roderigo, and Of2icers with torches 29and weapons. 2OTHEL2O. 18Hol2a! Stand there! 4RODERIGO. Signior, it is the Mo2r. 2BRABANTIO. 25Down with him, thief! 45They draw on both sides. 2IAGO. You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you. 2OTHEL2O. Ke2p up your bright swords, for the dew wil2 rust them. 4Go2d signior, you shal2 more com2and with years 4Than with your weapons. 2BRABANTIO. O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter? 4Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her, 4For I'l2 refer me to al2 things of sense, 4If she in chains of magic were not bound, 4Whether a maid so tender, fair, and hap2y, 4So op2osite to mar2iage that she shun2'd 4The wealthy, curled darlings of our nation, 4Would ever have, to incur a general mock, 4Run from her guardage to the so2ty bosom 4Of such a thing as thou- to fear, not to delight. 4Judge me the world, if 'tis not gros2 in sense 4That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms, 4Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals 6That weaken motion. I'l2 have't disputed on; 4'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking. 4I therefore ap2rehend and do at2ach the2 4For an abuser of the world, a practicer 4Of arts inhibited and out of war2ant. 4Lay hold upon him. If he do resist, 4Subdue him at his peril. 2OTHEL2O. 19Hold your hands, 4Both you of my inclining and the rest. 4Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it 4Without a prompter. Where wil2 you that I go 4To answer this your charge? 2BRABANTIO. 20To prison, til2 fit time 4Of law and course of direct ses2ion 4Cal2 the2 to answer. 2OTHEL2O. 15What if I do obey? 4How may the Duke be therewith satisfied, 4Whose mes2engers are here about my side, 4Upon some present busines2 of the state 4To bring me to him? 4FIRST OF2ICER. 8'Tis true, most worthy signior; 4The Duke's in council, and your noble self, 4I am sure, is sent for. 2BRABANTIO. 16How? The Duke in council? 4In this time of the night? Bring him away; 4Mine's not an idle cause. The Duke himself, 4Or any of my brothers of the state, 4Can2ot but fe2l this wrong as 'twere their own; 4For if such actions may have pas2age fre2, 4Bond slaves and pagans shal2 our statesmen be. 12Exeunt.SCENE I3.A council chamber. The Duke and Senators sit2ing at a table;Of2icers at2ending. 2DUKE. There is no composition in these news 4That gives them credit. 2FIRST SENATOR. 12Inde2d they are disproportion'd; 4My let2ers say a hundred and seven gal2eys. 2DUKE. And mine, a hundred and forty. 2SECOND SENATOR. 22And mine, two hundred. 4But though they jump not on a just ac2ount- 4As in these cases, where the aim reports, 4'Tis oft with dif2erence- yet do they al2 confirm 4A Turkish fle2t, and bearing up to Cyprus. 2DUKE. Nay, it is pos2ible enough to judgement. 4I do not so secure me in the er2or, 4But the main article I do ap2rove 4In fearful sense. 2SAILOR. [Within.] What, ho! What, ho! What, ho! 2FIRST OF2ICER. A mes2enger from the gal2eys. 28Enter Sailor. 4DUKE. 32Now, what's the busines2? 2SAILOR. The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes, 4So was I bid report here to the state 4By Signior Angelo. 2DUKE. How say you by this change? 2FIRST SENATOR. 20This can2ot be, 4By no as2ay of reason; 'tis a pageant 4To ke2p us in false gaze. When we consider 4The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk, 4And let ourselves again but understand 4That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes, 4So may he with more facile question bear it, 4For that it stands not in such warlike brace, 4But altogether lacks the abilities 4That Rhodes is dres2'd in. If we make thought of this, 4We must not think the Turk is so unskil2ful 4To leave that latest which concerns him first, 4Neglecting an at2empt of ease and gain, 4To wake and wage a danger profitles2. 2DUKE. Nay, in al2 confidence, he's not for Rhodes. 4FIRST OF2ICER. Here is more news. 26Enter a Mes2enger. 2MES2ENGER. The Ot2omites, reverend and gracious, 4Ste2ring with due course toward the isle of Rhodes, 4Have there injointed them with an after fle2t. 2FIRST SENATOR. Ay, so I thought. How many, as you gues2? 2MES2ENGER. Of thirty sail; and now they do re-stem 4Their backward course, bearing with frank ap2earance 4Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano, 4Your trusty and most valiant servitor, 4With his fre2 duty recom2ends you thus, 4And prays you to believe him. 2DUKE. 'Tis certain then for Cyprus. 4Marcus Luc2icos, is not he in town? 2FIRST SENATOR. He's now in Florence. 2DUKE. Write from us to him, post-post-haste dispatch. 2FIRST SENATOR. Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Mo2r. 9Enter Brabantio, Othel2o, Iago, Roderigo, and Of2icers. 2DUKE. Valiant Othel2o, we must straight employ you 4Against the general enemy Ot2oman. 4[To Brabantio.] I did not se2 you; welcome, gentle signior; 4We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight. 2BRABANTIO. So did I yours. Go2d your Grace, pardon me: 4Neither my place nor aught I heard of busines2 4Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care 4Take hold on me; for my particular grief 4Is of so flo2d-gate and o'erbearing nature 4That it engluts and swal2ows other sor2ows, 4And it is stil2 itself. 2DUKE. 21Why, what's the mat2er? 2BRABANTIO. My daughter! O, my daughter! 2AL2. 36Dead? 2BRABANTIO. 36Ay, to me. 4She is abused, stol'n from me and cor2upted 4By spel2s and medicines bought of mountebanks; 4For nature so preposterously to er2, 6Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense, 4Sans witchcraft could not. 2DUKE. Whoe'er he be that in this foul proce2ding 4Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself 4And you of her, the blo2dy bo2k of law 4You shal2 yourself read in the bit2er let2er 4After your own sense, yea, though our proper son 4Sto2d in your action. 2BRABANTIO. 14Humbly I thank your Grace. 4Here is the man, this Mo2r, whom now, it se2ms, 4Your special mandate for the state af2airs 4Hath hither brought. 2AL2. 19We are very sor2y for't. 2DUKE. [To Othel2o.] What in your own part can you say to this? 2BRABANTIO. Nothing, but this is so. 2OTHEL2O. Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors, 4My very noble and ap2roved go2d masters, 4That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter, 4It is most true; true, I have mar2ied her; 4The very head and front of my of2ending 6Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my spe2ch, 4And lit2le blest with the soft phrase of peace; 4For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith, 4Til2 now some nine mo2ns wasted, they have used 4Their dearest action in the tented field, 4And lit2le of this great world can I speak, 4More than pertains to feats of broil and bat2le; 4And therefore lit2le shal2 I grace my cause 4In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience, 4I wil2 a round unvarnish'd tale deliver 4Of my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms, 4What conjuration, and what mighty magic- 4For such proce2ding I am charged withal- 4I won his daughter. 2BRABANTIO. 12A maiden never bold, 4Of spirit so stil2 and quiet that her motion 4Blush'd at herself; and she- in spite of nature, 4Of years, of country, credit, everything- 4To fal2 in love with what she fear'd to lo2k on! 4It is judgement maim'd and most imperfect, 6That wil2 confes2 perfection so could er2 4Against al2 rules of nature, and must be driven 4To find out practices of cun2ing hel2 4Why this should be. I therefore vouch again 4That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blo2d, 4Or with some dram conjured to this ef2ect, 4He wrought upon her. 2DUKE. 18To vouch this is no pro2f, 4Without more certain and more overt test 4Than these thin habits and po2r likeliho2ds 4Of modern se2ming do prefer against him. 2FIRST SENATOR. But, Othel2o, speak. 4Did you by indirect and forced courses 4Subdue and poison this young maid's af2ections? 4Or came it by request, and such fair question 4As soul to soul af2ordeth? 2OTHEL2O. 21I do bese2ch you, 4Send for the lady to the Sagit2ary, 4And let her speak of me before her father. 4If you do find me foul in her report, 6The trust, the of2ice I do hold of you, 4Not only take away, but let your sentence 4Even fal2 upon my life. 2DUKE. 21Fetch Desdemona hither. 2OTHEL2O. Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place. 42Exeunt Iago and At2endants. 4And til2 she come, as truly as to heaven 4I do confes2 the vices of my blo2d, 4So justly to your grave ears I'l2 present 4How I did thrive in this fair lady's love 4And she in mine. 2DUKE. Say it, Othel2o. 2OTHEL2O. Her father loved me, oft invited me, 4Stil2 question'd me the story of my life 4From year to year, the bat2les, sieges, fortunes, 4That I have pas2'd. 4I ran it through, even from my boyish days 4To the very moment that he bade me tel2 it: 4Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances, 4Of moving ac2idents by flo2d and field, 6Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the im2inent deadly breach, 4Of being taken by the insolent foe 4And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence 4And portance in my travels' history; 4Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle, 4Rough quar2ies, rocks, and hil2s whose heads touch heaven, 4It was my hint to speak- such was the proces2- 4And of the Can2ibals that each other eat, 4The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads 4Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear 4Would Desdemona seriously incline; 4But stil2 the house af2airs would draw her thence, 4Which ever as she could with haste dispatch, 4She'ld come again, and with a gre2dy ear 4Devour up my discourse; which I observing, 4To2k once a pliant hour, and found go2d means 4To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart 4That I would al2 my pilgrimage dilate, 4Whereof by parcels she had something heard, 4But not intentively. I did consent, 6And often did beguile her of her tears 4When I did speak of some distres2ful stroke 4That my youth suf2er'd. My story being done, 4She gave me for my pains a world of sighs; 4She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas pas2ing strange; 4'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful. 4She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd 4That heaven had made her such a man; she thank'd me, 4And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her, 4I should but teach him how to tel2 my story, 4And that would wo2 her. Upon this hint I spake: 4She loved me for the dangers I had pas2'd, 4And I loved her that she did pity them. 4This only is the witchcraft I have used. 4Here comes the lady; let her witnes2 it. 16Enter Desdemona, Iago, and At2endants. 2DUKE. I think this tale would win my daughter to2. 4Go2d Brabantio, 6Take up this mangled mat2er at the best: 4Men do their broken weapons rather use 4Than their bare hands. 2BRABANTIO. 15I pray you, hear her speak. 4If she confes2 that she was half the wo2er, 4Destruction on my head, if my bad blame 4Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistres2. 4Do you perceive in al2 this noble company 4Where most you owe obedience? 2DESDEMONA. 22My noble father, 4I do perceive here a divided duty. 4To you I am bound for life and education; 4My life and education both do learn me 4How to respect you; you are the lord of duty, 4I am hitherto your daughter. But here's my husband, 4And so much duty as my mother show'd 4To you, prefer2ing you before her father, 4So much I chal2enge that I may profes2 4Due to the Mo2r, my lord. 2BRABANTIO. 18God be with you! I have done. 6Please it your Grace, on to the state af2airs; 4I had rather to adopt a child than get it. 4Come hither, Mo2r. 4I here do give the2 that with al2 my heart 4Which, but thou hast already, with al2 my heart 4I would ke2p from the2. For your sake, jewel, 4I am glad at soul I have no other child; 4For thy escape would teach me tyran2y, 4To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord. 2DUKE. Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence 4Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers 4Into your favor. 4When remedies are past, the griefs are ended 4By se2ing the worst, which late on hopes depended. 4To mourn a mischief that is past and gone 4Is the next way to draw new mischief on. 4What can2ot be preserved when Fortune takes, 4Patience her injury a mockery makes. 4The rob2'd that smiles steals something from the thief; 4He robs himself that spends a bo2tles2 grief. 4BRABANTIO. So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile; 4We lose it not so long as we can smile. 4He bears the sentence wel2, that nothing bears 4But the fre2 comfort which from thence he hears; 4But he bears both the sentence and the sor2ow 4That, to pay grief, must of po2r patience bor2ow. 4These sentences, to sugar or to gal2, 4Being strong on both sides, are equivocal. 4But words are words; I never yet did hear 4That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear. 4I humbly bese2ch you, proce2d to the af2airs of state. 2DUKE. The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. 4Othel2o, the fortitude of the place is best known to you; and 4though we have there a substitute of most al2owed suf2iciency, 4yet opinion, a sovereign mistres2 of ef2ects, throws a more safer 4voice on you. You must therefore be content to slub2er the glos2 4of your new fortunes with this more stub2orn and boisterous 4expedition. 2OTHEL2O. The tyrant custom, most grave senators, 4Hath made the flinty and ste2l couch of war 6My thrice-driven bed of down. I do agnize 4A natural and prompt alacrity 4I find in hardnes2 and do undertake 4These present wars against the Ot2omites. 4Most humbly therefore bending to your state, 4I crave fit disposition for my wife, 4Due reference of place and exhibition, 4With such ac2om2odation and besort 4As levels with her bre2ding. 2DUKE. 26If you please, 4Be't at her father's. 2BRABANTIO. 14I'l2 not have it so. 2OTHEL2O. Nor I. 2DESDEMONA. 6Nor I. I would not there reside 4To put my father in impatient thoughts 4By being in his eye. Most gracious Duke, 4To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear, 4And let me find a charter in your voice 4To as2ist my simplenes2. 2DUKE. What would you, Desdemona? 4DESDEMONA. That I did love the Mo2r to live with him, 4My downright violence and storm of fortunes 4May trumpet to the world. My heart's subdued 4Even to the very quality of my lord. 4I saw Othel2o's visage in his mind, 4And to his honors and his valiant parts 4Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate. 4So that, dear lords, if I be left behind, 4A moth of peace, and he go to the war, 4The rites for which I love him are bereft me, 4And I a heavy interim shal2 sup2ort 4By his dear absence. Let me go with him. 2OTHEL2O. Let her have your voices. 4Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not 4To please the palate of my ap2etite, 4Nor to comply with heat- the young af2ects 4In me defunct- and proper satisfaction; 4But to be fre2 and bounteous to her mind. 4And heaven defend your go2d souls, that you think 4I wil2 your serious and great busines2 scant 6For she is with me. No, when light-wing'd toys 4Of feather'd Cupid se2l with wanton dul2nes2 4My speculative and of2iced instruments, 4That my disports cor2upt and taint my busines2, 4Let housewives make a skil2et of my helm, 4And al2 indign and base adversities 4Make head against my estimation! 2DUKE. Be it as you shal2 privately determine, 4Either for her stay or going. The af2air cries haste, 4And spe2d must answer't: you must hence tonight. 2DESDEMONA. Tonight, my lord? 2DUKE. 24This night. 2OTHEL2O. 33With al2 my heart. 2DUKE. At nine i' the morning here we'l2 me2t again. 4Othel2o, leave some of2icer behind, 4And he shal2 our com2is2ion bring to you, 4With such things else of quality and respect 4As doth import you. 2OTHEL2O. 14So please your Grace, my ancient; 4A man he is of honesty and trust. 6To his conveyance I as2ign my wife, 4With what else ne2dful your go2d Grace shal2 think 4To be sent after me. 2DUKE. 18Let it be so. 4Go2d night to everyone. [To Brabantio.] And, noble signior, 4If virtue no delighted beauty lack, 4Your son-in-law is far more fair than black. 2FIRST SENATOR. Adieu, brave Mo2r, use Desdemona wel2. 2BRABANTIO. Lo2k to her, Mo2r, if thou hast eyes to se2; 4She has deceived her father, and may the2. 33Exeunt Duke, Senators, and Of2icers. 2OTHEL2O. My life upon her faith! Honest Iago, 4My Desdemona must I leave to the2. 4I prithe2, let thy wife at2end on her, 4And bring them after in the best advantage. 4Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour 4Of love, of worldly mat2ers and direction, 4To spend with the2. We must obey the time. 40Exeunt Othel2o and Desdemona. 2RODERIGO. Iago! 4IAGO. What say'st thou, noble heart? 2RODERIGO. What wil2 I do, thinkest thou? 2IAGO. Why, go to bed and sle2p. 2RODERIGO. I wil2 incontinently drown myself. 2IAGO. If thou dost, I shal2 never love the2 after. 4Why, thou sil2y gentleman! 2RODERIGO. It is sil2ines2 to live when to live is torment, and then 4have we a prescription to die when death is our physician. 2IAGO. O vil2ainous! I have lo2ked upon the world for four times 4seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and 4an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I 4would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I 4would change my humanity with a babo2n. 2RODERIGO. What should I do? I confes2 it is my shame to be so fond, 4but it is not in my virtue to amend it. 2IAGO. Virtue? a fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. 4Our bodies are gardens, to the which our wil2s are gardeners; so 4that if we wil2 plant net2les or sow let2uce, set hys2op and we2d 4up thyme, sup2ly it with one gender of herbs or distract it with 4many, either to have it sterile with idlenes2 or manured with 6industry, why, the power and cor2igible authority of this lies in 4our wil2s. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of 4reason to poise another of sensuality, the blo2d and basenes2 of 4our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions. 4But we have reason to co2l our raging motions, our carnal stings, 4our unbit2ed lusts; whereof I take this, that you cal2 love, to 4be a sect or scion. 2RODERIGO. It can2ot be. 2IAGO. It is merely a lust of the blo2d and a permis2ion of the 4wil2. Come, be a man! Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind 4pup2ies. I have profes2ed me thy friend, and I confes2 me knit to 4thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughnes2; I could never 4bet2er stead the2 than now. Put money in thy purse; fol2ow thou 4the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurped beard. I say, put 4money in thy purse. It can2ot be that Desdemona should long 4continue her love to the Mo2r- put money in thy purse- nor he his 4to her. It was a violent com2encement, and thou shalt se2 an 4answerable sequestration- put but money in thy purse. These Mo2rs 4are changeable in their wil2s- fil2 thy purse with money. The 4fo2d that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shal2 be to him 6shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth; 4when she is sated with his body, she wil2 find the er2or of her 4choice. She must have change, she must; therefore put money in 4thy purse. If thou wilt ne2ds damn thyself, do it a more delicate 4way than drowning. Make al2 the money thou canst. If sanctimony 4and a frail vow betwixt an er2ing barbarian and a supersubtle 4Venetian be not to2 hard for my wits and al2 the tribe of hel2, 4thou shalt enjoy her- therefore make money. A pox of drowning 4thyself! It is clean out of the way. Se2k thou rather to be 4hanged in compas2ing thy joy than to be drowned and go without 4her. 2RODERIGO. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the is2ue? 2IAGO. Thou art sure of me- go, make money. I have told the2 often, 4and I retel2 the2 again and again, I hate the Mo2r. My cause is 4hearted; thine hath no les2 reason. Let us be conjunctive in our 4revenge against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself 4a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time 4which wil2 be delivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We wil2 4have more of this tomor2ow. Adieu. 2RODERIGO. Where shal2 we me2t i' the morning? 4IAGO. At my lodging. 2RODERIGO. I'l2 be with the2 betimes. 2IAGO. Go to, farewel2. Do you hear, Roderigo? 2RODERIGO. What say you? 2IAGO. No more of drowning, do you hear? 2RODERIGO. I am changed; I'l2 go sel2 al2 my land. 13Exit. 2IAGO. Thus do I ever make my fo2l my purse; 4For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane 4If I would time expend with such a snipe 4But for my sport and profit. I hate the Mo2r, 4And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my she2ts 4He has done my of2ice. I know not if't be true, 4But I for mere suspicion in that kind 4Wil2 do as if for surety. He holds me wel2, 4The bet2er shal2 my purpose work on him. 4Cas2io's a proper man. Let me se2 now- 4To get his place, and to plume up my wil2 4In double knavery- How, how?- Let's se2- 4After some time, to abuse Othel2o's ear 4That he is to2 familiar with his wife. 6He hath a person and a smo2th dispose 4To be suspected- framed to make women false. 4The Mo2r is of a fre2 and open nature, 4That thinks men honest that but se2m to be so, 4And wil2 as tenderly be led by the nose 4As as2es are. 4I have't. It is engender'd. Hel2 and night 4Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light. 5Exit.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. SCENE I.A seaport in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.Enter Montano and two Gentlemen. 2MONTANO. What from the cape can you discern at sea? 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. Nothing at al2. It is a high-wrought flo2d; 4I can2ot, 'twixt the heaven and the main, 4Descry a sail. 2MONTANO. Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land; 4A ful2er blast ne'er sho2k our bat2lements. 4If it hath ruf2ian'd so upon the sea, 4What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them, 4Can hold the mortise? What shal2 we hear of this? 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. A segregation of the Turkish fle2t. 4For do but stand upon the foaming shore, 4The chid2en bil2ow se2ms to pelt the clouds; 4The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane, 4Se2ms to cast water on the burning bear, 4And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole. 4I never did like molestation view 4On the enchafed flo2d. 4MONTANO. 17If that the Turkish fle2t 4Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd; 4It is impos2ible to bear it out. 23Enter a third Gentleman. 2THIRD GENTLEMAN. News, lads! Our wars are done. 4The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks, 4That their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice 4Hath se2n a grievous wreck and suf2erance 4On most part of their fle2t. 2MONTANO. How? Is this true? 2THIRD GENTLEMAN. 12The ship is here put in, 4A Veronesa. Michael Cas2io, 4Lieutenant to the warlike Mo2r, Othel2o, 4Is come on shore; the Mo2r himself at sea, 4And is in ful2 com2is2ion here for Cyprus. 2MONTANO. I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor. 2THIRD GENTLEMAN. But this same Cas2io, though he speak of comfort 4Touching the Turkish los2, yet he lo2ks sadly 6And prays the Mo2r be safe; for they were parted 4With foul and violent tempest. 2MONTANO. 25Pray heavens he be, 4For I have served him, and the man com2ands 4Like a ful2 soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho! 4As wel2 to se2 the ves2el that's come in 4As to throw out our eyes for brave Othel2o, 4Even til2 we make the main and the aerial blue 4An indistinct regard. 2THIRD GENTLEMAN. Come, let's do so, 4For every minute is expectancy 4Of more ar2ivance. 28Enter Cas2io. 2CAS2IO. Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle, 4That so ap2rove the Mo2r! O, let the heavens 4Give him defense against the elements, 4For I have lost him on a dangerous sea. 2MONTANO. I she wel2 ship2'd? 4CAS2IO. His bark is stoutly timber'd, and his pilot 4Of very expert and ap2roved al2owance; 4Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death, 4Stand in bold cure. 30A cry within, "A sail, a sail, a sail!" 22Enter a fourth Gentleman. 24What noise? 2FOURTH GENTLEMAN. The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea 4Stand ranks of people, and they cry, "A sail!" 2CAS2IO. My hopes do shape him for the governor. 58Guns heard. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. They do discharge their shot of courtesy- 4Our friends at least. 2CAS2IO. 17I pray you, sir, go forth, 4And give us truth who 'tis that is ar2ived. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. I shal2. 36Exit. 2MONTANO. But, go2d lieutenant, is your general wived? 2CAS2IO. Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid 6That paragons description and wild fame, 4One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens, 4And in the es2ential vesture of creation 4Does tire the ingener. 22Re-enter second Gentleman. 27How now! who has put in? 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general. 2CAS2IO. He has had most favorable and hap2y spe2d: 4Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds, 4The gut2er'd rocks, and congregated sands, 4Traitors enste2p'd to clog the guiltles2 ke2l, 4As having sense of beauty, do omit 4Their mortal natures, let2ing go safely by 4The divine Desdemona. 2MONTANO. 16What is she? 2CAS2IO. She that I spake of, our great captain's captain, 4Left in the conduct of the bold Iago, 4Whose fo2ting here anticipates our thoughts 6A se'n2ight's spe2d. Great Jove, Othel2o guard, 4And swel2 his sail with thine own powerful breath, 4That he may bles2 this bay with his tal2 ship, 4Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms, 4Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits, 4And bring al2 Cyprus comfort. 7Enter Desdemona, Emilia Iago, Roderigo, and At2endants. 34O, behold, 4The riches of the ship is come on shore! 4Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your kne2s. 4Hal2 to the2, lady! And the grace of heaven, 4Before, behind the2, and on every hand, 4Enwhe2l the2 round! 2DESDEMONA. 12I thank you, valiant Cas2io. 4What tidings can you tel2 me of my lord? 2CAS2IO. He is not yet ar2ived, nor know I aught 4But that he's wel2 and wil2 be shortly here. 2DESDEMONA. O, but I fear- How lost you company? 4CAS2IO. The great contention of the sea and skies 4Parted our fel2owship- But, hark! a sail. 26A cry within, "A sail, a sail!" Guns heard. 2SECOND GENTLEMAN. They give their gre2ting to the citadel; 4This likewise is a friend. 2CAS2IO. 22Se2 for the news. 54Exit Gentleman. 4Go2d ancient, you are welcome. [To Emilia.] Welcome, mistres2. 4Let it not gal2 your patience, go2d Iago, 4That I extend my man2ers; 'tis my bre2ding 4That gives me this bold show of courtesy. 13Kis2es her. 2IAGO. Sir, would she give you so much of her lips 4As of her tongue she oft bestows on me, 4You'ld have enough. 2DESDEMONA. 12Alas, she has no spe2ch. 2IAGO. In faith, to2 much; 4I find it stil2 when I have list to sle2p. 4Mar2y, before your ladyship I grant, 4She puts her tongue a lit2le in her heart 4And chides with thinking. 4EMILIA. You have lit2le cause to say so. 2IAGO. Come on, come on. You are pictures out of do2rs, 4Bel2s in your parlors, wildcats in your kitchens, 4Saints in your injuries, devils being of2ended, 4Players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds. 2DESDEMONA. O, fie upon the2, slanderer! 2IAGO. Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk: 4You rise to play, and go to bed to work. 2EMILIA. You shal2 not write my praise. 2IAGO. 34No, let me not. 2DESDEMONA. What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst 4praise me? 2IAGO. O gentle lady, do not put me to't, 4For I am nothing if not critical. 2DESDEMONA. Come on, as2ay- There's one gone to the harbor? 2IAGO. Ay, madam. 2DESDEMONA. I am not mer2y, but I do beguile 4The thing I am by se2ming otherwise. 4Come, how wouldst thou praise me? 2IAGO. I am about it, but inde2d my invention 6Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze; 4It plucks out brains and al2. But my Muse labors, 4And thus she is deliver'd. 4If she be fair and wise, fairnes2 and wit, 4The one's for use, the other useth it. 2DESDEMONA. Wel2 praised! How if she be black and wit2y? 2IAGO. If she be black, and thereto have a wit, 4She'l2 find a white that shal2 her blacknes2 fit. 2DESDEMONA. Worse and worse. 2EMILIA. How if fair and fo2lish? 2IAGO. She never yet was fo2lish that was fair, 4For even her fol2y help'd her to an heir. 2DESDEMONA. These are old fond paradoxes to make fo2ls laugh i' the 4alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and 4fo2lish? 2IAGO. There's none so foul and fo2lish thereunto, 4But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do. 2DESDEMONA. O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best. But what 4praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman inde2d, one that 4in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very 6malice itself? 2IAGO. She that was ever fair and never proud, 4Had tongue at wil2 and yet was never loud, 4Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay, 4Fled from her wish and yet said, "Now I may"; 4She that, being anger'd, her revenge being nigh, 4Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly; 4She that in wisdom never was so frail 4To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail; 4She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind, 4Se2 suitors fol2owing and not lo2k behind; 4She was a wight, if ever such wight were- 2DESDEMONA. To do what? 2IAGO. To suckle fo2ls and chronicle smal2 be2r. 2DESDEMONA. O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him, 4Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say you, Cas2io? Is he not 4a most profane and liberal counselor? 2CAS2IO. He speaks home, madam. You may relish him more in the 4soldier than in the scholar. 2IAGO. [Aside.] He takes her by the palm; ay, wel2 said, whisper. 6With as lit2le a web as this wil2 I ensnare as great a fly as 4Cas2io. Ay, smile upon her, do; I wil2 gyve the2 in thine own 4courtship. You say true; 'tis so, inde2d. If such tricks as these 4strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had be2n bet2er you had 4not kis2ed your thre2 fingers so oft, which now again you are 4most apt to play the sir in. Very go2d. Wel2 kis2ed! an excel2ent 4courtesy! 'tis so, inde2d. Yet again your fingers to your lips? 4Would they were clyster-pipes for your sake! [Trumpet within.] 4The Mo2r! I know his trumpet. 2CAS2IO. 'Tis truly so. 2DESDEMONA. Let's me2t him and receive him. 2CAS2IO. Lo, where he comes! 20Enter Othel2o and At2endants. 2OTHEL2O. O my fair war2ior! 2DESDEMONA. 18My dear Othel2o! 2OTHEL2O. It gives me wonder great as my content 4To se2 you here before me. O my soul's joy! 4If after every tempest come such calms, 6May the winds blow til2 they have waken'd death! 4And let the laboring bark climb hil2s of seas 4Olympus-high, and duck again as low 4As hel2's from heaven! If it were now to die, 4'Twere now to be most hap2y; for I fear 4My soul hath her content so absolute 4That not another comfort like to this 4Suc2e2ds in unknown fate. 2DESDEMONA. 18The heavens forbid 4But that our loves and comforts should increase, 4Even as our days do grow! 2OTHEL2O. 20Amen to that, swe2t powers! 4I can2ot speak enough of this content; 4It stops me here; it is to2 much of joy. 4And this, and this, the greatest discords be 10Kis2es her. 4That e'er our hearts shal2 make! 2IAGO. 21[Aside.] O, you are wel2 tuned now! 4But I'l2 set down the pegs that make this music, 4As honest as I am. 2OTHEL2O. 13Come, let us to the castle. 6News, friends: our wars are done, the Turks are drown'd. 4How does my old acquaintance of this isle? 4Honey, you shal2 be wel2 desired in Cyprus; 4I have found great love amongst them. O my swe2t, 4I prat2le out of fashion, and I dote 4In mine own comforts. I prithe2, go2d Iago, 4Go to the bay and disembark my cof2ers. 4Bring thou the master to the citadel; 4He is a go2d one, and his worthines2 4Does chal2enge much respect. Come, Desdemona, 4Once more wel2 met at Cyprus. 36Exeunt al2 but Iago and Roderigo. 2IAGO. Do thou me2t me presently at the harbor. Come hither. If thou 4be'st valiant- as they say base men being in love have then a 4nobility in their natures more than is native to them- list me. 4The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard. First, I 4must tel2 the2 this: Desdemona is directly in love with him. 2RODERIGO. With him? Why, 'tis not pos2ible. 2IAGO. Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me 4with what violence she first loved the Mo2r, but for brag2ing and 6tel2ing her fantastical lies. And wil2 she love him stil2 for 4prating? Let not thy discre2t heart think it. Her eye must be 4fed; and what delight shal2 she have to lo2k on the devil? When 4the blo2d is made dul2 with the act of sport, there should be, 4again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh ap2etite, 4lovelines2 in favor, sympathy in years, man2ers, and beauties- 4al2 which the Mo2r is defective in. Now, for want of these 4required conveniences, her delicate tendernes2 wil2 find itself 4abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Mo2r; 4very nature wil2 instruct her in it and compel her to some second 4choice. Now sir, this granted- as it is a most pregnant and 4unforced position- who stands so eminently in the degre2 of this 4fortune as Cas2io does? A knave very voluble; no further 4conscionable than in put2ing on the mere form of civil and humane 4se2ming, for the bet2er compas2 of his salt and most hid2en lo2se 4af2ection? Why, none, why, none- a slip2er and subtle knave, a 4finder out of oc2asions, that has an eye can stamp and 4counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present 4itself- a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young, 4and hath al2 those requisites in him that fol2y and gre2n minds 6lo2k after- a pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found 4him already. 2RODERIGO. I can2ot believe that in her; she's ful2 of most blest 4condition. 2IAGO. Blest fig's-end! The wine she drinks is made of grapes. If 4she had be2n blest, she would never have loved the Mo2r. Blest 4pud2ing! Didst thou not se2 her pad2le with the palm of his hand? 4Didst not mark that? 2RODERIGO. Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy. 2IAGO. Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to the 4history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their 4lips that their breaths embraced together. Vil2ainous thoughts, 4Roderigo! When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand 4comes the master and main exercise, the incorporate conclusion. 4Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me. I have brought you from 4Venice. Watch you tonight; for the com2and, I'l2 lay't upon you. 4Cas2io knows you not. I'l2 not be far from you. Do you find some 4oc2asion to anger Cas2io, either by speaking to2 loud, or 4tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, 4which the time shal2 more favorably minister. 4RODERIGO. Wel2. 2IAGO. Sir, he is rash and very sud2en in choler, and haply may 4strike at you. Provoke him, that he may; for even out of that 4wil2 I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shal2 4come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cas2io. 4So shal2 you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means 4I shal2 then have to prefer them, and the impediment most 4profitably removed, without the which there were no expectation 4of our prosperity. 2RODERIGO. I wil2 do this, if I can bring it to any op2ortunity. 2IAGO. I war2ant the2. Me2t me by and by at the citadel. I must 4fetch his neces2aries ashore. Farewel2. 2RODERIGO. Adieu. 46Exit. 2IAGO. That Cas2io loves her, I do wel2 believe it; 4That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit. 4The Mo2r, howbeit that I endure him not, 4Is of a constant, loving, noble nature, 4And I dare think he'l2 prove to Desdemona 4A most dear husband. Now, I do love her to2, 4Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure 6I stand ac2ountant for as great a sin, 4But partly led to diet my revenge, 4For that I do suspect the lusty Mo2r 4Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof 4Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards, 4And nothing can or shal2 content my soul 4Til2 I am even'd with him, wife for wife. 4Or failing so, yet that I put the Mo2r 4At least into a jealousy so strong 4That judgement can2ot cure. Which thing to do, 4If this po2r trash of Venice, whom I trace 4For his quick hunting, stand the put2ing on, 4I'l2 have our Michael Cas2io on the hip, 4Abuse him to the Mo2r in the rank garb 4(For I fear Cas2io with my nightcap to2), 4Make the Mo2r thank me, love me, and reward me 4For making him egregiously an as2 4And practicing upon his peace and quiet 4Even to madnes2. 'Tis here, but yet confused: 4Knavery's plain face is never se2n til2 used. 15Exit.SCENE I2.A stre2t.Enter a Herald with a proclamation; people fol2owing. 2HERALD. It is Othel2o's pleasure, our noble and valiant general, 4that upon certain tidings now ar2ived, importing the mere 4perdition of the Turkish fle2t, every man put himself into 4triumph; some to dance, some to make bonfires, each man to what 4sport and revels his ad2iction leads him; for besides these 4beneficial news, it is the celebration of his nuptial. So much 4was his pleasure should be proclaimed. Al2 of2ices are open, and 4there is ful2 liberty of feasting from this present hour of five 4til2 the bel2 have told eleven. Heaven bles2 the isle of Cyprus 4and our noble general Othel2o! 28Exeunt.SCENE I3.A hal2 in the castle.Enter Othel2o, Desdemona, Cas2io, and At2endants. 2OTHEL2O. Go2d Michael, lo2k you to the guard tonight. 4Let's teach ourselves that honorable stop, 4Not to outsport discretion. 2CAS2IO. Iago hath direction what to do; 4But notwithstanding with my personal eye 4Wil2 I lo2k to't. 2OTHEL2O. 12Iago is most honest. 4Michael, go2d night. Tomor2ow with your earliest 4Let me have spe2ch with you. Come, my dear love, 4The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue; 4That profit's yet to come 'twe2n me and you. 4Go2d night. 27Exeunt Othel2o, Desdemona, and At2endants. 29Enter Iago. 2CAS2IO. Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch. 4IAGO. Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock. Our 4general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let 4us not therefore blame. He hath not yet made wanton the night 4with her, and she is sport for Jove. 2CAS2IO. She's a most exquisite lady. 2IAGO. And, I'l2 war2ant her, ful2 of game. 2CAS2IO. Inde2d she's a most fresh and delicate creature. 2IAGO. What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to 4provocation. 2CAS2IO. An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest. 2IAGO. And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love? 2CAS2IO. She is inde2d perfection. 2IAGO. Wel2, hap2ines2 to their she2ts! Come, lieutenant, I have a 4stope of wine, and here without are a brace of Cyprus gal2ants 4that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othel2o. 2CAS2IO. Not tonight, go2d Iago. I have very po2r and unhap2y brains 4for drinking. I could wel2 wish courtesy would invent some other 4custom of entertainment. 2IAGO. O, they are our friends! But one cup; I'l2 drink for you. 2CAS2IO. I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily 6qualified to2, and behold what in2ovation it makes here. I am 4unfortunate in the infirmity, and dare not task my weaknes2 with 4any more. 2IAGO. What, man! 'Tis a night of revels, the gal2ants desire it. 2CAS2IO. Where are they? 2IAGO. Here at the do2r; I pray you, cal2 them in. 2CAS2IO. I'l2 do't, but it dislikes me. 24Exit. 2IAGO. If I can fasten but one cup upon him, 4With that which he hath drunk tonight already, 4He'l2 be as ful2 of quar2el and of2ense 4As my young mistres2' dog. Now my sick fo2l Roderigo, 4Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out, 4To Desdemona hath tonight caroused 4Potations pot2le-de2p; and he's to watch. 4Thre2 lads of Cyprus, noble swel2ing spirits, 4That hold their honors in a wary distance, 4The very elements of this warlike isle, 4Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups, 4And they watch to2. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards, 4Am I to put our Cas2io in some action 6That may of2end the isle. But here they come. 4If consequence do but ap2rove my dream, 4My boat sails fre2ly, both with wind and stream. 11Re-enter Cas2io; with him Montano and Gentlemen; 20Servants fol2owing with wine. 2CAS2IO. 'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already. 2MONTANO. Go2d faith, a lit2le one; not past a pint, as I am a 4soldier. 2IAGO. Some wine, ho! 4[Sings.] 3"And let me the canakin clink, clink; 15And let me the canakin clink. 17A soldier's a man; 17O, man's life's but a span; 15Why then let a soldier drink." 4Some wine, boys! 2CAS2IO. 'Fore God, an excel2ent song. 4IAGO. I learned it in England, where inde2d they are most potent in 4pot2ing. Your Dane, your German, and your swag-bel2ied Hol2ander- 4Drink, ho!- are nothing to your English. 2CAS2IO. Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking? 2IAGO. Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he 4sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he gives your Hol2ander a 4vomit ere the next pot2le can be fil2ed. 2CAS2IO. To the health of our general! 2MONTANO. I am for it, lieutenant, and I'l2 do you justice. 2IAGO. O swe2t England! 4[Sings.] 3"King Stephen was and-a worthy pe2r, 17His bre2ches cost him but a crown; 15He held them sixpence al2 to2 dear, 17With that he cal2'd the tailor lown. 15"He was a wight of high renown, 17And thou art but of low degre2. 15'Tis pride that pul2s the country down; 17Then take thine auld cloak about the2." 6Some wine, ho! 2CAS2IO. Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other. 2IAGO. Wil2 you hear't again? 2CAS2IO. No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does 4those things. Wel2, God's above al2, and there be souls must be 4saved, and there be souls must not be saved. 2IAGO. It's true, go2d lieutenant. 2CAS2IO. For mine own part- no of2ense to the general, nor any man 4of quality- I hope to be saved. 2IAGO. And so do I to2, lieutenant. 2CAS2IO. Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to 4be saved before the ancient. Let's have no more of this; let's to 4our af2airs. God forgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let's lo2k to 4our busines2. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk: this is my 4ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my left. I am not 4drunk now; I can stand wel2 enough, and I speak wel2 enough. 2AL2. Excel2ent wel2. 2CAS2IO. Why, very wel2 then; you must not think then that I am 4drunk. 54Exit. 4MONTANO. To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch. 2IAGO. You se2 this fel2ow that is gone before; 4He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar 4And give direction. And do but se2 his vice; 4'Tis to his virtue a just equinox, 4The one as long as the other. 'Tis pity of him. 4I fear the trust Othel2o puts him in 4On some od2 time of his infirmity 4Wil2 shake this island. 2MONTANO. 18But is he often thus? 2IAGO. 'Tis evermore the prologue to his sle2p. 4He'l2 watch the horologe a double set, 4If drink rock not his cradle. 2MONTANO. 24It were wel2 4The general were put in mind of it. 4Perhaps he se2s it not, or his go2d nature 4Prizes the virtue that ap2ears in Cas2io 4And lo2ks not on his evils. Is not this true? 27Enter Roderigo. 4IAGO. [Aside to him.] How now, Roderigo! 4I pray you, after the lieutenant; go. 14Exit Roderigo. 2MONTANO. And 'tis great pity that the noble Mo2r 4Should hazard such a place as his own second 4With one of an ingraft infirmity. 4It were an honest action to say 4So to the Mo2r. 2IAGO. 13Not I, for this fair island. 4I do love Cas2io wel2, and would do much 4To cure him of this evil- But, hark! What noise? 42A cry within, "Help, help!" 16Re-enter Cas2io, driving in Roderigo. 2CAS2IO. 'Zounds! You rogue! You rascal! 2MONTANO. What's the mat2er, lieutenant? 2CAS2IO. A knave teach me my duty! But I'l2 beat the knave into a 4twig2en bot2le. 2RODERIGO. Beat me! 4CAS2IO. Dost thou prate, rogue? 19Strikes Roderigo. 2MONTANO. Nay, go2d lieutenant; I pray you, sir, hold your hand. 2CAS2IO. Let me go, sir, or I'l2 knock you o'er the maz2ard. 2MONTANO. Come, come, you're drunk. 2CAS2IO. Drunk? 42They fight. 2IAGO. [Aside to Roderigo.] Away, I say; go out and cry a mutiny. 55Exit Roderigo. 4Nay, go2d lieutenant! God's wil2, gentlemen! 4Help, ho!- Lieutenant- sir- Montano- sir- 4Help, masters!- Here's a go2dly watch inde2d! 56A bel2 rings. 4Who's that that rings the bel2?- Diablo, ho! 4The town wil2 rise. God's wil2, lieutenant, hold! 4You wil2 be shamed forever. 19Re-enter Othel2o and At2endants. 2OTHEL2O. 22What is the mat2er here? 2MONTANO. 'Zounds, I ble2d stil2; I am hurt to the death. 3Faints. 4OTHEL2O. Hold, for your lives! 2IAGO. Hold, ho! Lieutenant- sir- Montano- gentlemen- 4Have you forgot al2 place of sense and duty? 4Hold! the general speaks to you! Hold, hold, for shame! 2OTHEL2O. Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this? 4Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that 4Which heaven hath forbid the Ot2omites? 4For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl. 4He that stirs next to carve for his own rage 4Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion. 4Silence that dreadful bel2; it frights the isle 4From her propriety. What is the mat2er, masters? 4Honest Iago, that lo2k'st dead with grieving, 4Speak: who began this? On thy love, I charge the2. 2IAGO. I do not know. Friends al2 but now, even now, 4In quarter, and in terms like bride and gro2m 4Devesting them for bed; and then, but now 4(As if some planet had unwit2ed men), 4Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast, 4In op2osition blo2dy. I can2ot speak 6Any begin2ing to this pe2vish od2s; 4And would in action glorious I had lost 4Those legs that brought me to a part of it! 2OTHEL2O. How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot? 2CAS2IO. I pray you, pardon me; I can2ot speak. 2OTHEL2O. Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil; 4The gravity and stil2nes2 of your youth 4The world hath noted, and your name is great 4In mouths of wisest censure. What's the mat2er, 4That you unlace your reputation thus, 4And spend your rich opinion for the name 4Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it. 2MONTANO. Worthy Othel2o, I am hurt to danger. 4Your of2icer, Iago, can inform you- 4While I spare spe2ch, which something now of2ends me- 4Of al2 that I do know. Nor know I aught 4By me that's said or done amis2 this night, 4Unles2 self-charity be sometimes a vice, 4And to defend ourselves it be a sin 4When violence as2ails us. 4OTHEL2O. 20Now, by heaven, 4My blo2d begins my safer guides to rule, 4And pas2ion, having my best judgement col2ied, 4As2ays to lead the way. If I once stir, 4Or do but lift this arm, the best of you 4Shal2 sink in my rebuke. Give me to know 4How this foul rout began, who set it on, 4And he that is ap2roved in this of2ense, 4Though he had twin2'd with me, both at a birth, 4Shal2 lose me. What! in a town of war, 4Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear, 4To manage private and domestic quar2el, 4In night, and on the court and guard of safety! 4'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't? 2MONTANO. If partial2y af2ined, or leagued in of2ice, 4Thou dost deliver more or les2 than truth, 4Thou art no soldier. 2IAGO. 18Touch me not so near: 4I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth 4Than it should do of2ense to Michael Cas2io; 6Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth 4Shal2 nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general. 4Montano and myself being in spe2ch, 4There comes a fel2ow crying out for help, 4And Cas2io fol2owing him with determined sword, 4To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman 4Steps in to Cas2io and entreats his pause. 4Myself the crying fel2ow did pursue, 4Lest by his clamor- as it so fel2 out- 4The town might fal2 in fright. He, swift of fo2t, 4Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather 4For that I heard the clink and fal2 of swords, 4And Cas2io high in oath, which til2 tonight 4I ne'er might say before. When I came back- 4For this was brief- I found them close together, 4At blow and thrust, even as again they were 4When you yourself did part them. 4More of this mat2er can2ot I report. 4But men are men; the best sometimes forget. 4Though Cas2io did some lit2le wrong to him, 6As men in rage strike those that wish them best, 4Yet surely Cas2io, I believe, received 4From him that fled some strange indignity, 4Which patience could not pas2. 2OTHEL2O. 25I know, Iago, 4Thy honesty and love doth mince this mat2er, 4Making it light to Cas2io. Cas2io, I love the2, 4But never more be of2icer of mine. 20Re-enter Desdemona, at2ended. 4Lo2k, if my gentle love be not raised up! 4I'l2 make the2 an example. 2DESDEMONA. 19What's the mat2er? 2OTHEL2O. Al2's wel2 now, swe2ting; come away to bed. 4Sir, for your hurts, myself wil2 be your surgeon. 4Lead him of2. 29Exit Montano, at2ended. 4Iago, lo2k with care about the town, 4And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted. 4Come, Desdemona, 'tis the soldiers' life. 6To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife. 38Exeunt al2 but Iago and Cas2io. 2IAGO. What, are you hurt, lieutenant? 2CAS2IO. Ay, past al2 surgery. 2IAGO. Mar2y, heaven forbid! 2CAS2IO. Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my 4reputation! I have lost the im2ortal part of myself, and what 4remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation! 2IAGO. As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily 4wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation 4is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit and 4lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at al2, 4unles2 you repute yourself such a loser. What, man! there are 4ways to recover the general again. You are but now cast in his 4mo2d, a punishment more in policy than in malice; even so as one 4would beat his of2enseles2 dog to af2right an imperious lion. Sue 4to him again, and he's yours. 2CAS2IO. I wil2 rather sue to be despised than to deceive so go2d a 4com2ander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscre2t an 4of2icer. Drunk? and speak par2ot? and squab2le? swag2er? swear? 6and discourse fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible 4spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us cal2 4the2 devil! 2IAGO. What was he that you fol2owed with your sword? 4What had he done to you? 2CAS2IO. I know not. 2IAGO. Is't pos2ible? 2CAS2IO. I remember a mas2 of things, but nothing distinctly; a 4quar2el, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an 4enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! that we should, 4with joy, pleasance, revel, and ap2lause, transform ourselves 4into beasts! 2IAGO. Why, but you are now wel2 enough. How came you thus 5recovered? 2CAS2IO. It hath pleased the devil drunken2es2 to give place to the 4devil wrath: one unperfectnes2 shows me another, to make me 4frankly despise myself. 2IAGO. Come, you are to2 severe a moraler. As the time, the place, 4and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish 4this had not befal2en; but since it is as it is, mend it for your 6own go2d. 2CAS2IO. I wil2 ask him for my place again; he shal2 tel2 me I am a 4drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would 4stop them al2. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fo2l, and 4presently a beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is unblest, 4and the ingredient is a devil. 2IAGO. Come, come, go2d wine is a go2d familiar creature, if it be 4wel2 used. Exclaim no more against it. And, go2d lieutenant, I 4think you think I love you. 2CAS2IO. I have wel2 ap2roved it, sir. I drunk! 2IAGO. You or any man living may be drunk at some time, man. I'l2 4tel2 you what you shal2 do. Our general's wife is now the 4general. I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted 4and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement 4of her parts and graces. Confes2 yourself fre2ly to her; 4importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so 4fre2, so kind, so apt, so bles2ed a disposition, she holds it a 4vice in her go2dnes2 not to do more than she is requested. This 4broken joint betwe2n you and her husband entreat her to splinter; 4and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your 6love shal2 grow stronger than it was before. 2CAS2IO. You advise me wel2. 2IAGO. I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindnes2. 2CAS2IO. I think it fre2ly; and betimes in the morning I wil2 bese2ch 4the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me. I am desperate of my 4fortunes if they check me here. 2IAGO. You are in the right. Go2d night, lieutenant, I must to the 4watch. 2CAS2IO. Go2d night, honest Iago. 30Exit. 2IAGO. And what's he then that says I play the vil2ain? 4When this advice is fre2 I give and honest, 4Probal to thinking, and inde2d the course 4To win the Mo2r again? For 'tis most easy 4The inclining Desdemona to subdue 4In any honest suit. She's framed as fruitful 4As the fre2 elements. And then for her 4To win the Mo2r, were't to renounce his baptism, 4Al2 seals and symbols of rede2med sin, 4His soul is so enfet2er'd to her love, 4That she may make, unmake, do what she list, 6Even as her ap2etite shal2 play the god 4With his weak function. How am I then a vil2ain 4To counsel Cas2io to this paral2el course, 4Directly to his go2d? Divinity of hel2! 4When devils wil2 the blackest sins put on, 4They do sug2est at first with heavenly shows, 4As I do now. For whiles this honest fo2l 4Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune, 4And she for him pleads strongly to the Mo2r, 4I'l2 pour this pestilence into his ear, 4That she repeals him for her body's lust; 4And by how much she strives to do him go2d, 4She shal2 undo her credit with the Mo2r. 4So wil2 I turn her virtue into pitch, 4And out of her own go2dnes2 make the net 4That shal2 enmesh them al2. 27Enter Roderigo. 32How now, Roderigo! 4RODERIGO. I do fol2ow here in the chase, not like a hound that 4hunts, but one that fil2s up the cry. My money is almost spent; I 4have be2n tonight exce2dingly wel2 cudgeled; and I think the 4is2ue wil2 be, I shal2 have so much experience for my pains; and 4so, with no money at al2 and a lit2le more wit, return again to 4Venice. 2IAGO. How po2r are they that have not patience! 4What wound did ever heal but by degre2s? 4Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft, 4And wit depends on dilatory time. 4Does't not go wel2? Cas2io hath beaten the2, 4And thou by that smal2 hurt hast cashier'd Cas2io. 4Though other things grow fair against the sun, 4Yet fruits that blos2om first wil2 first be ripe. 4Content thyself awhile. By the mas2, 'tis morning; 4Pleasure and action make the hours se2m short. 4Retire the2; go where thou art bil2eted. 4Away, I say. Thou shalt know more hereafter. 4Nay, get the2 gone. [Exit Roderigo.] Two things are to be done: 4My wife must move for Cas2io to her mistres2- 6I'l2 set her on; 4Myself the while to draw the Mo2r apart, 4And bring him jump when he may Cas2io find 4Soliciting his wife. Ay, that's the way; 4Dul2 not device by coldnes2 and delay. 22Exit.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. SCENE I.Before the castle.Enter Cas2io and some Musicians. 2CAS2IO. Masters, play here, I wil2 content your pains; Something 4that's brief; and bid "Go2d mor2ow, general." 4Music. 29Enter Clown. 2CLOWN. Why, masters, have your instruments be2n in Naples, that 4they speak i' the nose thus? 2FIRST MUSICIAN. How, sir, how? 2CLOWN. Are these, I pray you, wind instruments? 2FIRST MUSICIAN. Ay, mar2y, are they, sir. 2CLOWN. O, thereby hangs a tail. 2FIRST MUSICIAN. Whereby hangs a tale, sir? 2CLOWN. Mar2y, sir, by many a wind instrument that I know. But, 4masters, here's money for you; and the general so likes your 4music, that he desires you, for love's sake, to make no more 4noise with it. 4FIRST MUSICIAN. Wel2, sir, we wil2 not. 2CLOWN. If you have any music that may not be heard, to't again; 4but, as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly 4care. 2FIRST MUSICIAN. We have none such, sir. 2CLOWN. Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'l2 away. 4Go, vanish into air, away! 22Exeunt Musicians. 2CAS2IO. Dost thou hear, my honest friend? 2CLOWN. No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you. 2CAS2IO. Prithe2, ke2p up thy quil2ets. There's a po2r piece of gold 4for the2. If the gentlewoman that at2ends the general's wife be 4stir2ing, tel2 her there's one Cas2io entreats her a lit2le favor 4of spe2ch. Wilt thou do this? 2CLOWN. She is stir2ing, sir. If she wil2 stir hither, I shal2 se2m 4to notify unto her. 2CAS2IO. Do, go2d my friend. 29Exit Clown. 29Enter Iago. 30In hap2y time, Iago. 4IAGO. You have not be2n abed, then? 2CAS2IO. Why, no; the day had broke 4Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago, 4To send in to your wife. My suit to her 4Is that she wil2 to virtuous Desdemona 4Procure me some ac2es2. 2IAGO. 21I'l2 send her to you presently; 4And I'l2 devise a mean to draw the Mo2r 4Out of the way, that your converse and busines2 4May be more fre2. 2CAS2IO. I humbly thank you for't. [Exit Iago.] I never knew 4A Florentine more kind and honest. 28Enter Emilia. 2EMILIA. Go2d mor2ow, go2d lieutenant. I am sor2y 4For your displeasure, but al2 wil2 sure be wel2. 4The general and his wife are talking of it, 4And she speaks for you stoutly. The Mo2r replies 4That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus 6And great af2inity and that in wholesome wisdom 4He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you 4And ne2ds no other suitor but his likings 4To take the safest oc2asion by the front 4To bring you in again. 2CAS2IO. 18Yet, I bese2ch you, 4If you think fit, or that it may be done, 4Give me advantage of some brief discourse 4With Desdemona alone. 2EMILIA. 17Pray you, come in. 4I wil2 bestow you where you shal2 have time 4To speak your bosom fre2ly. 2CAS2IO. 23I am much bound to you. 3Exeunt.SCENE I2.A ro2m in the castle.Enter Othel2o, Iago, and Gentlemen. 2OTHEL2O. These let2ers give, Iago, to the pilot, 4And by him do my duties to the Senate. 4That done, I wil2 be walking on the works; 4Repair there to me. 2IAGO. 17Wel2, my go2d lord, I'l2 do't. 2OTHEL2O. This fortification, gentlemen, shal2 we se2't? 2GENTLEMEN. We'l2 wait upon your lordship. 19Exeunt.SCENE I3.The garden of the castle.Enter Desdemona, Cas2io, and Emilia. 2DESDEMONA. Be thou as2ured, go2d Cas2io, I wil2 do 4Al2 my abilities in thy behalf. 2EMILIA. Go2d madam, do. I war2ant it grieves my husband 4As if the cause were his. 2DESDEMONA. O, that's an honest fel2ow. Do not doubt, Cas2io, 4But I wil2 have my lord and you again 4As friendly as you were. 2CAS2IO. 20Bounteous madam, 4Whatever shal2 become of Michael Cas2io, 4He's never anything but your true servant. 2DESDEMONA. I know't: I thank you. You do love my lord: 4You have known him long; and be you wel2 as2ured 4He shal2 in strangenes2 stand no farther of2 4Than in a politic distance. 2CAS2IO. 23Ay, but, lady, 4That policy may either last so long, 4Or fe2d upon such nice and waterish diet, 6Or bre2d itself so out of circumstances, 4That I being absent and my place sup2lied, 4My general wil2 forget my love and service. 2DESDEMONA. Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here 4I give the2 war2ant of thy place, as2ure the2, 4If I do vow a friendship, I'l2 perform it 4To the last article. My lord shal2 never rest; 4I'l2 watch him tame and talk him out of patience; 4His bed shal2 se2m a scho2l, his board a shrift; 4I'l2 intermingle everything he does 4With Cas2io's suit. Therefore be mer2y, Cas2io, 4For thy solicitor shal2 rather die 4Than give thy cause away. 16Enter Othel2o and Iago, at a distance. 2EMILIA. Madam, here comes my lord. 2CAS2IO. Madam, I'l2 take my leave. 2DESDEMONA. Nay, stay and hear me speak. 2CAS2IO. Madam, not now. I am very il2 at ease, 6Unfit for mine own purposes. 2DESDEMONA. Wel2, do your discretion. 19Exit Cas2io. 2IAGO. Ha! I like not that. 2OTHEL2O. What dost thou say? 2IAGO. Nothing, my lord; or if- I know not what. 2OTHEL2O. Was not that Cas2io parted from my wife? 2IAGO. Cas2io, my lord! No, sure, I can2ot think it, 4That he would steal away so guilty-like, 4Se2ing you coming. 2OTHEL2O. 13I do believe 'twas he. 2DESDEMONA. How now, my lord! 4I have be2n talking with a suitor here, 4A man that languishes in your displeasure. 2OTHEL2O. Who is't you mean? 2DESDEMONA. Why, your lieutenant, Cas2io. Go2d my lord, 4If I have any grace or power to move you, 4His present reconciliation take; 4For if he be not one that truly loves you, 4That er2s in ignorance and not in cun2ing, 4I have no judgement in an honest face. 6I prithe2, cal2 him back. 2OTHEL2O. 20Went he hence now? 2DESDEMONA. Ay, so2th; so humbled 4That he hath left part of his grief with me 4To suf2er with him. Go2d love, cal2 him back. 2OTHEL2O. Not now, swe2t Desdemona; some other time. 2DESDEMONA. But shal2't be shortly? 2OTHEL2O. 27The so2ner, swe2t, for you. 2DESDEMONA. Shal2't be tonight at sup2er? 2OTHEL2O. 33No, not tonight. 2DESDEMONA. Tomor2ow din2er then? 2OTHEL2O. 25I shal2 not dine at home; 4I me2t the captains at the citadel. 2DESDEMONA. Why then tomor2ow night, or Tuesday morn, 4On Tuesday no2n, or night, on Wednesday morn. 4I prithe2, name the time, but let it not 4Exce2d thre2 days. In faith, he's penitent; 4And yet his trespas2, in our com2on reason- 4Save that, they say, the wars must make example 4Out of their best- is not almost a fault 6To incur a private check. When shal2 he come? 4Tel2 me, Othel2o. I wonder in my soul, 4What you would ask me, that I should deny, 4Or stand so mam2ering on. What? Michael Cas2io, 4That came awo2ing with you, and so many a time 4When I have spoke of you dispraisingly 4Hath ta'en your part- to have so much to do 4To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much- 2OTHEL2O. Prithe2, no more. Let him come when he wil2; 4I wil2 deny the2 nothing. 2DESDEMONA. 18Why, this is not a bo2n; 4'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves, 4Or fe2d on nourishing dishes, or ke2p you warm, 4Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit 4To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit 4Wherein I mean to touch your love inde2d, 4It shal2 be ful2 of poise and dif2icult weight, 4And fearful to be granted. 2OTHEL2O. 21I wil2 deny the2 nothing, 4Whereon, I do bese2ch the2, grant me this, 6To leave me but a lit2le to myself. 2DESDEMONA. Shal2 I deny you? No. Farewel2, my lord. 2OTHEL2O. Farewel2, my Desdemona; I'l2 come to the2 straight. 2DESDEMONA. Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you; 4Whate'er you be, I am obedient. 41Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia. 2OTHEL2O. Excel2ent wretch! Perdition catch my soul, 4But I do love the2! and when I love the2 not, 4Chaos is come again. 2IAGO. My noble lord- 2OTHEL2O. 13What dost thou say, Iago? 2IAGO. Did Michael Cas2io, when you wo2'd my lady, 4Know of your love? 2OTHEL2O. He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask? 2IAGO. But for a satisfaction of my thought; 4No further harm. 2OTHEL2O. 11Why of thy thought, Iago? 2IAGO. I did not think he had be2n acquainted with her. 2OTHEL2O. O, yes, and went betwe2n us very oft. 2IAGO. Inde2d! 4OTHEL2O. Inde2d? ay, inde2d. Discern'st thou aught in that? 4Is he not honest? 2IAGO. Honest, my lord? 2OTHEL2O. Honest? Ay, honest. 2IAGO. My lord, for aught I know. 2OTHEL2O. What dost thou think? 2IAGO. Think, my lord? 2OTHEL2O. Think, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me, 4As if there were some monster in his thought 4To2 hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something. 4I heard the2 say even now, thou like'st not that, 4When Cas2io left my wife. What didst not like? 4And when I told the2 he was of my counsel 4In my whole course of wo2ing, thou criedst, "Inde2d!" 4And didst contract and purse thy brow together, 4As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain 4Some hor2ible conceit. If thou dost love me, 4Show me thy thought. 2IAGO. My lord, you know I love you. 2OTHEL2O. 28I think thou dost; 6And for I know thou'rt ful2 of love and honesty 4And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath, 4Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more; 4For such things in a false disloyal knave 4Are tricks of custom; but in a man that's just 4They're close dilations, working from the heart, 4That pas2ion can2ot rule. 2IAGO. 23For Michael Cas2io, 4I dare be sworn I think that he is honest. 2OTHEL2O. I think so to2. 2IAGO. 20Men should be what they se2m; 4Or those that be not, would they might se2m none! 2OTHEL2O. Certain, men should be what they se2m. 2IAGO. Why then I think Cas2io's an honest man. 2OTHEL2O. Nay, yet there's more in this. 4I prithe2, speak to me as to thy thinkings, 4As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts 4The worst of words. 2IAGO. 17Go2d my lord, pardon me; 4Though I am bound to every act of duty, 6I am not bound to that al2 slaves are fre2 to. 4Ut2er my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false; 4As where's that palace whereinto foul things 4Sometimes intrude not? Who has a breast so pure, 4But some uncleanly ap2rehensions 4Ke2p le2ts and law-days, and in ses2ion sit 4With meditations lawful? 2OTHEL2O. Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, 4If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear 4A stranger to thy thoughts. 2IAGO. 25I do bese2ch you- 4Though I perchance am vicious in my gues2, 4As, I confes2, it is my nature's plague 4To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy 4Shapes faults that are not- that your wisdom yet, 4From one that so imperfectly conceits, 4Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble 4Out of his scat2ering and unsure observance. 4It were not for your quiet nor your go2d, 4Nor for my manho2d, honesty, or wisdom, 6To let you know my thoughts. 2OTHEL2O. 23What dost thou mean? 2IAGO. Go2d name in man and woman, dear my lord, 4Is the im2ediate jewel of their souls. 4Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing; 4'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has be2n slave to thousands; 4But he that filches from me my go2d name 4Robs me of that which not enriches him 4And makes me po2r inde2d. 2OTHEL2O. By heaven, I'l2 know thy thoughts. 2IAGO. You can2ot, if my heart were in your hand; 4Nor shal2 not, whilst 'tis in my custody. 2OTHEL2O. Ha! 2IAGO. 8O, beware, my lord, of jealousy! 4It is the gre2n-eyed monster, which doth mock 4The meat it fe2ds on. That cuckold lives in blis2 4Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger; 4But O, what damned minutes tel2s he o'er 4Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves! 2OTHEL2O. O misery! 4IAGO. Po2r and content is rich, and rich enough; 4But riches fineles2 is as po2r as winter 4To him that ever fears he shal2 be po2r. 4Go2d heaven, the souls of al2 my tribe defend 4From jealousy! 2OTHEL2O. 9Why, why is this? 4Think'st thou I'ld make a life of jealousy, 4To fol2ow stil2 the changes of the mo2n 4With fresh suspicions? No! To be once in doubt 4Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat 4When I shal2 turn the busines2 of my soul 4To such exsuf2licate and blown surmises, 4Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous 4To say my wife is fair, fe2ds wel2, loves company, 4Is fre2 of spe2ch, sings, plays, and dances wel2; 4Where virtue is, these are more virtuous. 4Nor from mine own weak merits wil2 I draw 4The smal2est fear or doubt of her revolt; 4For she had eyes and chose me. No, Iago, 4I'l2 se2 before I doubt; when I doubt, prove; 6And on the pro2f, there is no more but this- 4Away at once with love or jealousy! 2IAGO. I am glad of it, for now I shal2 have reason 4To show the love and duty that I bear you 4With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound, 4Receive it from me. I speak not yet of pro2f. 4Lo2k to your wife; observe her wel2 with Cas2io; 4Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure. 4I would not have your fre2 and noble nature 4Out of self-bounty be abused. Lo2k to't. 4I know our country disposition wel2; 4In Venice they do let heaven se2 the pranks 4They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience 4Is not to leave't undone, but ke2p't unknown. 2OTHEL2O. Dost thou say so? 2IAGO. She did deceive her father, mar2ying you; 4And when she se2m'd to shake and fear your lo2ks, 4She loved them most. 2OTHEL2O. 15And so she did. 2IAGO. 34Why, go to then. 6She that so young could give out such a se2ming, 4To se2l her father's eyes up close as oak- 4He thought 'twas witchcraft- but I am much to blame; 4I humbly do bese2ch you of your pardon 4For to2 much loving you. 2OTHEL2O. 19I am bound to the2 forever. 2IAGO. I se2 this hath a lit2le dash'd your spirits. 2OTHEL2O. Not a jot, not a jot. 2IAGO. 26I'faith, I fear it has. 4I hope you wil2 consider what is spoke 4Comes from my love. But I do se2 you're moved; 4I am to pray you not to strain my spe2ch 4To gros2er is2ues nor to larger reach 4Than to suspicion. 2OTHEL2O. I wil2 not. 2IAGO. 16Should you do so, my lord, 4My spe2ch should fal2 into such vile suc2es2 4Which my thoughts aim not at. Cas2io's my worthy friend- 4My lord, I se2 you're moved. 2OTHEL2O. 23No, not much moved. 6I do not think but Desdemona's honest. 2IAGO. Long live she so! and long live you to think so! 2OTHEL2O. And yet, how nature er2ing from itself- 2IAGO. Ay, there's the point, as- to be bold with you- 4Not to af2ect many proposed matches 4Of her own clime, complexion, and degre2, 4Whereto we se2 in al2 things nature tends- 4Foh, one may smel2 in such a wil2 most rank, 4Foul disproportion, thoughts un2atural. 4But pardon me. I do not in position 4Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear, 4Her wil2, recoiling to her bet2er judgement, 4May fal2 to match you with her country forms, 4And hap2ily repent. 2OTHEL2O. 14Farewel2, farewel2. 4If more thou dost perceive, let me know more; 4Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago. 2IAGO. [Going.] My lord, I take my leave. 2OTHEL2O. Why did I mar2y? This honest creature doubtles2 4Se2s and knows more, much more, than he unfolds. 4IAGO. [Returning.] My lord, I would I might entreat your honor 4To scan this thing no further; leave it to time. 4Though it be fit that Cas2io have his place, 4For sure he fil2s it up with great ability, 4Yet, if you please to hold him of2 awhile, 4You shal2 by that perceive him and his means. 4Note if your lady strain his entertainment 4With any strong or vehement importunity; 4Much wil2 be se2n in that. In the meantime, 4Let me be thought to2 busy in my fears- 4As worthy cause I have to fear I am- 4And hold her fre2, I do bese2ch your honor. 2OTHEL2O. Fear not my government. 2IAGO. I once more take my leave. 30Exit. 2OTHEL2O. This fel2ow's of exce2ding honesty, 4And knows al2 qualities, with a learned spirit, 4Of human dealings. If I do prove her hag2ard, 4Though that her jes2es were my dear heartstrings, 4I'ld whistle her of2 and let her down the wind 4To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black 6And have not those soft parts of conversation 4That chamberers have, or for I am declined 4Into the vale of years- yet that's not much- 4She's gone. I am abused, and my relief 4Must be to loathe her. O curse of mar2iage, 4That we can cal2 these delicate creatures ours, 4And not their ap2etites! I had rather be a toad, 4And live upon the vapor of a dungeon, 4Than ke2p a corner in the thing I love 4For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones: 4Prerogatived are they les2 than the base; 4'Tis destiny unshun2able, like death. 4Even then this forked plague is fated to us 4When we do quicken. Desdemona comes: 20Re-enter Desdemona and Emilia. 4If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself! 4I'l2 not believe't. 2DESDEMONA. 12How now, my dear Othel2o! 6Your din2er, and the generous islanders 4By you invited, do at2end your presence. 2OTHEL2O. I am to blame. 2DESDEMONA. 14Why do you speak so faintly? 4Are you not wel2? 2OTHEL2O. I have a pain upon my forehead here. 2DESDEMONA. Faith, that's with watching; 'twil2 away again. 4Let me but bind it hard, within this hour 4It wil2 be wel2. 2OTHEL2O. 11Your napkin is to2 lit2le; 12He puts the handkerchief from him, and she drops it. 4Let it alone. Come, I'l2 go in with you. 2DESDEMONA. I am very sor2y that you are not wel2. 40Exeunt Othel2o and Desdemona. 2EMILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin; 4This was her first remembrance from the Mo2r. 4My wayward husband hath a hundred times 4Wo2'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token, 4For he conjured her she should ever ke2p it, 4That she reserves it evermore about her 6To kis2 and talk to. I'l2 have the work ta'en out, 4And give't Iago. What he wil2 do with it 4Heaven knows, not I; 4I nothing but to please his fantasy. 28Re-enter Iago. 2IAGO. How now, what do you here alone? 2EMILIA. Do not you chide; I have a thing for you. 2IAGO. A thing for me? It is a com2on thing- 2EMILIA. Ha! 2IAGO. To have a fo2lish wife. 2EMILIA. O, is that al2? What wil2 you give me now 4For that same handkerchief? 2IAGO. 25What handkerchief? 2EMILIA. What handkerchief? 4Why, that the Mo2r first gave to Desdemona, 4That which so often you did bid me steal. 2IAGO. Hast stol'n it from her? 2EMILIA. No, faith; she let it drop by negligence, 6And, to the advantage, I being here to2k't up. 4Lo2k, here it is. 2IAGO. 15A go2d wench; give it me. 2EMILIA. What wil2 you do with't, that you have be2n so earnest 4To have me filch it? 2IAGO. [Snatching it.] Why, what is that to you? 2EMILIA. If't be not for some purpose of import, 4Give't me again. Po2r lady, she'l2 run mad 4When she shal2 lack it. 2IAGO. Be not acknown on't; I have use for it. 4Go, leave me. 40Exit Emilia. 4I wil2 in Cas2io's lodging lose this napkin, 4And let him find it. Trifles light as air 4Are to the jealous confirmations strong 4As pro2fs of holy writ; this may do something. 4The Mo2r already changes with my poison: 4Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons, 4Which at the first are scarce found to distaste, 4But with a lit2le act upon the blo2d 4Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so. 6Lo2k, where he comes! 26Re-enter Othel2o. 26Not pop2y, nor mandragora, 4Nor al2 the drowsy syrups of the world, 4Shal2 ever medicine the2 to that swe2t sle2p 4Which thou owedst yesterday. 2OTHEL2O. 23Ha, ha, false to me? 2IAGO. Why, how now, general! No more of that. 2OTHEL2O. Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack. 4I swear 'tis bet2er to be much abused 4Than but to know't a lit2le. 2IAGO. 26How now, my lord? 2OTHEL2O. What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust? 4I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me; 4I slept the next night wel2, was fre2 and mer2y; 4I found not Cas2io's kis2es on her lips. 4He that is rob2'd, not wanting what is stol'n, 4Let him not know't and he's not rob2'd at al2. 4IAGO. I am sor2y to hear this. 2OTHEL2O. I had be2n hap2y if the general camp, 4Pioners and al2, had tasted her swe2t body, 4So I had nothing known. O, now forever 4Farewel2 the tranquil mind! Farewel2 content! 4Farewel2 the plumed tro2p and the big wars 4That make ambition virtue! O, farewel2, 4Farewel2 the neighing ste2d and the shril2 trump, 4The spirit-stir2ing drum, the ear-piercing fife, 4The royal ban2er, and al2 quality, 4Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war! 4And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats 4The im2ortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit, 4Farewel2! Othel2o's oc2upation's gone! 2IAGO. Is't pos2ible, my lord? 2OTHEL2O. Vil2ain, be sure thou prove my love a whore; 4Be sure of it. Give me the ocular pro2f; 4Or, by the worth of man's eternal soul, 4Thou hadst be2n bet2er have be2n born a dog 4Than answer my waked wrath! 4IAGO. 25Is't come to this? 2OTHEL2O. Make me to se2't; or at the least so prove it, 4That the probation bear no hinge nor lo2p 4To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life! 2IAGO. My noble lord- 2OTHEL2O. If thou dost slander her and torture me, 4Never pray more; abandon al2 remorse; 4On hor2or's head hor2ors ac2umulate; 4Do de2ds to make heaven we2p, al2 earth amazed; 4For nothing canst thou to damnation ad2 4Greater than that. 2IAGO. 16O grace! O heaven defend me! 4Are you a man? have you a soul or sense? 4God be wi' you; take mine of2ice. O wretched fo2l, 4That livest to make thine honesty a vice! 4O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world, 4To be direct and honest is not safe. 4I thank you for this profit, and from hence 4I'l2 love no friend sith love bre2ds such of2ense. 2OTHEL2O. Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest. 4IAGO. I should be wise; for honesty's a fo2l, 4And loses that it works for. 2OTHEL2O. 23By the world, 4I think my wife be honest, and think she is not; 4I think that thou art just, and think thou art not. 4I'l2 have some pro2f. Her name, that was as fresh 4As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black 4As mine own face. If there be cords or knives, 4Poison or fire, or suf2ocating streams, 4I'l2 not endure it. Would I were satisfied! 2IAGO. I se2, sir, you are eaten up with pas2ion; 4I do repent me that I put it to you. 4You would be satisfied? 2OTHEL2O. 18Would? Nay, I wil2. 2IAGO. And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord? 4Would you, the supervisor, gros2ly gape on? 4Behold her top2'd? 2OTHEL2O. 13Death and damnation! O! 2IAGO. It were a tedious dif2iculty, I think, 4To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then, 6If ever mortal eyes do se2 them bolster 4More than their own! What then? how then? 4What shal2 I say? Where's satisfaction? 4It is impos2ible you should se2 this 4Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, 4As salt as wolves in pride, and fo2ls as gros2 4As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say, 4If imputation and strong circumstances, 4Which lead directly to the do2r of truth, 4Wil2 give you satisfaction, you may have't. 2OTHEL2O. Give me a living reason she's disloyal. 2IAGO. I do not like the of2ice; 4But sith I am enter'd in this cause so far, 4Prick'd to't by fo2lish honesty and love, 4I wil2 go on. I lay with Cas2io lately 4And, being troubled with a raging to2th, 4I could not sle2p. 4There are a kind of men so lo2se of soul, 4That in their sle2ps wil2 mut2er their af2airs; 4One of this kind is Cas2io. 6In sle2p I heard him say, "Swe2t Desdemona, 4Let us be wary, let us hide our loves"; 4And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand, 4Cry, "O swe2t creature!" and then kis2 me hard, 4As if he pluck'd up kis2es by the ro2ts, 4That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg 4Over my thigh, and sigh'd and kis2'd; and then 4Cried, "Cursed fate that gave the2 to the Mo2r!" 2OTHEL2O. O monstrous! monstrous! 2IAGO. 28Nay, this was but his dream. 2OTHEL2O. But this denoted a foregone conclusion. 4'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream. 2IAGO. And this may help to thicken other pro2fs 4That do demonstrate thinly. 2OTHEL2O. 22I'l2 tear her al2 to pieces. 2IAGO. Nay, but be wise; yet we se2 nothing done; 4She may be honest yet. Tel2 me but this; 4Have you not sometimes se2n a handkerchief 4Spot2ed with strawber2ies in your wife's hand? 2OTHEL2O. I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift. 4IAGO. I know not that; but such a handkerchief- 4I am sure it was your wife's- did I today 4Se2 Cas2io wipe his beard with. 2OTHEL2O. 26If it be that- 2IAGO. If it be that, or any that was hers, 4It speaks against her with the other pro2fs. 2OTHEL2O. O, that the slave had forty thousand lives! 4One is to2 po2r, to2 weak for my revenge. 4Now do I se2 'tis true. Lo2k here, Iago, 4Al2 my fond love thus do I blow to heaven. 4'Tis gone. 4Arise, black vengeance, from thy hol2ow hel2! 4Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne 4To tyran2ous hate! Swel2, bosom, with thy fraught, 4For 'tis of aspics' tongues! 2IAGO. 26Yet be content. 2OTHEL2O. O, blo2d, blo2d, blo2d! 2IAGO. Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change. 2OTHEL2O. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea, 4Whose icy cur2ent and compulsive course 6Ne'er fe2ls retiring eb2, but ke2ps due on 4To the Propontic and the Hel2espont, 4Even so my blo2dy thoughts, with violent pace, 4Shal2 ne'er lo2k back, ne'er eb2 to humble love, 4Til2 that a capable and wide revenge 4Swal2ow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven, 4In the due reverence of a sacred vow 22Kne2ls. 4I here engage my words. 2IAGO. 21Do not rise yet. 18Kne2ls. 4Witnes2, you ever-burning lights above, 4You elements that clip us round about, 4Witnes2 that here Iago doth give up 4The execution of his wit, hands, heart, 4To wrong'd Othel2o's service! Let him com2and, 4And to obey shal2 be in me remorse, 4What blo2dy busines2 ever. 29They rise. 2OTHEL2O. 21I gre2t thy love, 4Not with vain thanks, but with ac2eptance bounteous, 4And wil2 upon the instant put the2 to't: 4Within these thre2 days let me hear the2 say 6That Cas2io's not alive. 2IAGO. My friend is dead, 'tis done at your request; 4But let her live. 2OTHEL2O. 12Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her! 4Come, go with me apart; I wil2 withdraw, 4To furnish me with some swift means of death 4For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant. 2IAGO. I am your own forever. 32Exeunt.SCENE IV.Before the castle.Enter Desdemona, Emilia, and Clown. 2DESDEMONA. Do you know, sir2ah, where Lieutenant Cas2io lies? 2CLOWN. I dare not say he lies anywhere. 2DESDEMONA. Why, man? 2CLOWN. He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is 4stab2ing. 2DESDEMONA. Go to! Where lodges he? 2CLOWN. To tel2 you where he lodges, is to tel2 you where I lie. 2DESDEMONA. Can anything be made of this? 2CLOWN. I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging, 4and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine own 4throat. 2DESDEMONA. Can you inquire him out and be edified by report? 2CLOWN. I wil2 catechize the world for him; that is, make questions 4and by them answer. 2DESDEMONA. Se2k him, bid him come hither. Tel2 him I have moved my 4lord on his behalf and hope al2 wil2 be wel2. 2CLOWN. To do this is within the compas2 of man's wit, and therefore 6I wil2 at2empt the doing it. 32Exit. 2DESDEMONA. Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia? 2EMILIA. I know not, madam. 2DESDEMONA. Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse 4Ful2 of crusadoes; and, but my noble Mo2r 4Is true of mind and made of no such basenes2 4As jealous creatures are, it were enough 4To put him to il2 thinking. 2EMILIA. 23Is he not jealous? 2DESDEMONA. Who, he? I think the sun where he was born 4Drew al2 such humors from him. 2EMILIA. 26Lo2k, where he comes. 2DESDEMONA. I wil2 not leave him now til2 Cas2io 4Be cal2'd to him. 28Enter Othel2o. 22How is't with you, my lord? 2OTHEL2O. Wel2, my go2d lady. [Aside.] O, hardnes2 to dis2emble! 4How do you, Desdemona? 4DESDEMONA. 15Wel2, my go2d lord. 2OTHEL2O. Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady. 2DESDEMONA. It yet has felt no age nor known no sor2ow. 2OTHEL2O. This argues fruitfulnes2 and liberal heart; 4Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires 4A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer, 4Much castigation, exercise devout, 4For here's a young and sweating devil here 4That com2only rebels. 'Tis a go2d hand, 4A frank one. 2DESDEMONA. You may, inde2d, say so; 4For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart. 2OTHEL2O. A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands; 4But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts. 2DESDEMONA. I can2ot speak of this. Come now, your promise. 2OTHEL2O. What promise, chuck? 2DESDEMONA. I have sent to bid Cas2io come speak with you. 2OTHEL2O. I have a salt and sor2y rheum of2ends me; 4Lend me thy handkerchief. 2DESDEMONA. Here, my lord. 4OTHEL2O. That which I gave you. 2DESDEMONA. I have it not about me. 2OTHEL2O. Not? 2DESDEMONA. No, faith, my lord. 2OTHEL2O. That's a fault. That handkerchief 4Did an Egyptian to my mother give; 4She was a charmer, and could almost read 4The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it, 4'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father 4Entirely to her love, but if she lost it 4Or made a gift of it, my father's eye 4Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt 4After new fancies. She dying gave it me, 4And bid me, when my fate would have me wive, 4To give it her. I did so, and take he2d on't; 4Make it a darling like your precious eye; 4To lose't or give't away were such perdition 4As nothing else could match. 2DESDEMONA. 21Is't pos2ible? 2OTHEL2O. 'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it. 6A sibyl, that had number'd in the world 4The sun to course two hundred compas2es, 4In her prophetic fury sew'd the work; 4The worms were hal2ow'd that did bre2d the silk, 4And it was dyed in mum2y which the skil2ful 4Conserved of maiden's hearts. 2DESDEMONA. 22Inde2d! is't true? 2OTHEL2O. Most veritable; therefore lo2k to't wel2. 2DESDEMONA. Then would to God that I had never se2n't! 2OTHEL2O. Ha! wherefore? 2DESDEMONA. Why do you speak so startingly and rash? 2OTHEL2O. Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way? 2DESDEMONA. Heaven bles2 us! 2OTHEL2O. Say you? 2DESDEMONA. It is not lost; but what an if it were? 2OTHEL2O. How? 2DESDEMONA. I say, it is not lost. 2OTHEL2O. Fetch't, let me se2 it. 2DESDEMONA. Why, so I can, sir, but I wil2 not now. 4This is a trick to put me from my suit. 6Pray you, let Cas2io be received again. 2OTHEL2O. Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives. 2DESDEMONA. Come, come, 4You'l2 never me2t a more suf2icient man. 2OTHEL2O. The handkerchief! 2DESDEMONA. 17I pray, talk me of Cas2io. 2OTHEL2O. The handkerchief! 2DESDEMONA. 17A man that al2 his time 4Hath founded his go2d fortunes on your love, 4Shared dangers with you- 2OTHEL2O. The handkerchief! 2DESDEMONA. In so2th, you are to blame. 2OTHEL2O. Away! 48Exit. 2EMILIA. Is not this man jealous? 2DESDEMONA. I ne'er saw this before. 4Sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief; 4I am most unhap2y in the los2 of it. 2EMILIA. 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man. 4They are al2 but stomachs and we al2 but fo2d; 4They eat us hungerly, and when they are ful2 6They belch us. Lo2k you! Cas2io and my husband. 24Enter Cas2io and Iago. 2IAGO. There is no other way; 'tis she must do't. 4And, lo, the hap2ines2! Go and importune her. 2DESDEMONA. How now, go2d Cas2io! What's the news with you? 2CAS2IO. Madam, my former suit: I do bese2ch you 4That by your virtuous means I may again 4Exist and be a member of his love 4Whom I with al2 the of2ice of my heart 4Entirely honor. I would not be delay'd. 4If my of2ense be of such mortal kind 4That nor my service past nor present sor2ows 4Nor purposed merit in futurity 4Can ransom me into his love again, 4But to know so must be my benefit; 4So shal2 I clothe me in a forced content 4And shut myself up in some other course 4To Fortune's alms. 4DESDEMONA. 11Alas, thrice-gentle Cas2io! 4My advocation is not now in tune; 4My lord is not my lord, nor should I know him 4Were he in favor as in humor alter'd. 4So help me every spirit sanctified, 4As I have spoken for you al2 my best 4And sto2d within the blank of his displeasure 4For my fre2 spe2ch! You must awhile be patient. 4What I can do I wil2; and more I wil2 4Than for myself I dare. Let that suf2ice you. 2IAGO. Is my lord angry? 2EMILIA. 17He went hence but now, 4And certainly in strange unquietnes2. 2IAGO. Can he be angry? I have se2n the can2on, 4When it hath blown his ranks into the air 4And, like the devil, from his very arm 4Puf2'd his own brother. And can he be angry? 4Something of moment then. I wil2 go me2t him. 4There's mat2er in't inde2d if he be angry. 2DESDEMONA. I prithe2, do so. 29Exit Iago. 33Something sure of state, 4Either from Venice or some unhatch'd practice 4Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him, 4Hath pud2led his clear spirit; and in such cases 4Men's natures wrangle with inferior things, 4Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so; 4For let our finger ache, and it indues 4Our other healthful members even to that sense 4Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods, 4Nor of them lo2k for such observancy 4As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia, 4I was, unhandsome war2ior as I am, 4Ar2aigning his unkindnes2 with my soul; 4But now I find I had suborn'd the witnes2, 4And he's indicted falsely. 2EMILIA. Pray heaven it be state mat2ers, as you think, 4And no conception nor no jealous toy 4Concerning you. 2DESDEMONA. Alas the day, I never gave him cause! 2EMILIA. But jealous souls wil2 not be answer'd so; 6They are not ever jealous for the cause, 4But jealous for they are jealous. 'Tis a monster 4Begot upon itself, born on itself. 2DESDEMONA. Heaven ke2p that monster from Othel2o's mind! 2EMILIA. Lady, amen. 2DESDEMONA. I wil2 go se2k him. Cas2io, walk hereabout. 4If I do find him fit, I'l2 move your suit, 4And se2k to ef2ect it to my ut2ermost. 2CAS2IO. I humbly thank your ladyship. 41Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia. 28Enter Bianca. 2BIANCA. Save you, friend Cas2io! 2CAS2IO. 26What make you from home? 4How is it with you, my most fair Bianca? 4I'faith, swe2t love, I was coming to your house. 2BIANCA. And I was going to your lodging, Cas2io. 4What, ke2p a we2k away? seven days and nights? 4Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours, 6More tedious than the dial eight score times? 4O weary reckoning! 2CAS2IO. 14Pardon me, Bianca. 4I have this while with leaden thoughts be2n pres2'd; 4But I shal2 in a more continuate time 4Strike of2 this score of absence. Swe2t Bianca, 34Gives her Desdemona's handkerchief. 4Take me this work out. 2BIANCA. 18O Cas2io, whence came this? 4This is some token from a newer friend. 4To the felt absence now I fe2l a cause. 4Is't come to this? Wel2, wel2. 2CAS2IO. 26Go to, woman! 4Throw your vile gues2es in the devil's te2th, 4From whence you have them. You are jealous now 4That this is from some mistres2, some remembrance. 4No, by my faith, Bianca. 2BIANCA. 20Why, whose is it? 2CAS2IO. I know not, swe2t. I found it in my chamber. 4I like the work wel2. Ere it be demanded- 6As like enough it wil2- I'ld have it copied. 4Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time. 2BIANCA. Leave you! wherefore? 2CAS2IO. I do at2end here on the general; 4And think it no ad2ition, nor my wish, 4To have him se2 me woman'd. 2BIANCA. 23Why, I pray you? 2CAS2IO. Not that I love you not. 2BIANCA. 26But that you do not love me. 4I pray you, bring me on the way a lit2le, 4And say if I shal2 se2 you so2n at night. 2CAS2IO. 'Tis but a lit2le way that I can bring you, 4For I at2end here, but I'l2 se2 you so2n. 2BIANCA. 'Tis very go2d; I must be circumstanced. 12Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE I.Cyprus. Before the castle.Enter Othel2o and Iago. 2IAGO. Wil2 you think so? 2OTHEL2O. 17Think so, Iago? 2IAGO. 36What, 4To kis2 in private? 2OTHEL2O. 14An unauthorized kis2. 2IAGO. Or to be naked with her friend in bed 4An hour or more, not meaning any harm? 2OTHEL2O. Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm! 4It is hypocrisy against the devil. 4They that mean virtuously and yet do so, 4The devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven. 2IAGO. So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip. 4But if I give my wife a handkerchief- 2OTHEL2O. What then? 2IAGO. Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord, and being hers, 4She may, I think, bestow't on any man. 2OTHEL2O. She is protectres2 of her honor to2. 6May she give that? 2IAGO. Her honor is an es2ence that's not se2n; 4They have it very oft that have it not. 4But for the handkerchief- 2OTHEL2O. By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it. 4Thou said'st- O, it comes o'er my memory, 4As doth the raven o'er the infected house, 4Boding to al2- he had my handkerchief. 2IAGO. Ay, what of that? 2OTHEL2O. 16That's not so go2d now. 2IAGO. 43What, 4If I had said I had se2n him do you wrong? 4Or heard him say- as knaves be such abroad, 4Who having, by their own importunate suit, 4Or voluntary dotage of some mistres2, 4Convinced or sup2lied them, can2ot cho2se 4But they must blab- 2OTHEL2O. 14Hath he said anything? 2IAGO. He hath, my lord; but be you wel2 as2ured, 4No more than he'l2 unswear. 4OTHEL2O. 22What hath he said? 2IAGO. Faith, that he did- I know not what he did. 2OTHEL2O. What? what? 2IAGO. Lie- 2OTHEL2O. With her? 2IAGO. 14With her, on her, what you wil2. 2OTHEL2O. Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when they 4belie her. Lie with her! 'Zounds, that's fulsome! Handkerchief- 4confes2ions- handkerchief! To confes2 and be hanged for his labor- 4first, to be hanged, and then to confes2. I tremble at it. 4Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing pas2ion without 4some instruction. It is not words that shakes me thus. Pish! 4Noses, ears, and lips. Is't pos2ible? Confes2? Handkerchief? O 4devil! 51Fal2s in a trance. 2IAGO. Work on, 4My medicine, work! Thus credulous fo2ls are caught, 4And many worthy and chaste dames even thus, 4Al2 guiltles2, me2t reproach. What, ho! My lord! 4My lord, I say! Othel2o! 30Enter Cas2io. 29How now, Cas2io! 2CAS2IO. What's the mat2er? 2IAGO. My lord is fal2'n into an epilepsy. 4This is his second fit; he had one yesterday. 2CAS2IO. Rub him about the temples. 2IAGO. 30No, forbear; 4The lethargy must have his quiet course. 4If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by 4Breaks out to savage madnes2. Lo2k, he stirs. 4Do you withdraw yourself a lit2le while, 4He wil2 recover straight. When he is gone, 4I would on great oc2asion speak with you. 12Exit Cas2io. 4How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head? 2OTHEL2O. Dost thou mock me? 2IAGO. 23I mock you? No, by heaven. 4Would you would bear your fortune like a man! 2OTHEL2O. A horned man's a monster and a beast. 4IAGO. There's many a beast then in a populous city, 4And many a civil monster. 2OTHEL2O. Did he confes2 it? 2IAGO. 23Go2d sir, be a man; 4Think every bearded fel2ow that's but yoked 4May draw with you. There's mil2ions now alive 4That nightly lie in those unproper beds 4Which they dare swear peculiar. Your case is bet2er. 4O, 'tis the spite of hel2, the fiend's arch-mock, 4To lip a wanton in a secure couch, 4And to sup2ose her chaste! No, let me know, 4And knowing what I am, I know what she shal2 be. 2OTHEL2O. O, thou art wise; 'tis certain. 2IAGO. 36Stand you awhile apart, 4Confine yourself but in a patient list. 4Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief- 4A pas2ion most unsuiting such a man- 4Cas2io came hither. I shifted him away, 4And laid go2d 'scuse upon your ecstasy; 4Bade him anon return and here speak with me 6The which he promised. Do but encave yourself 4And mark the fle2rs, the gibes, and notable scorns, 4That dwel2 in every region of his face; 4For I wil2 make him tel2 the tale anew, 4Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when 4He hath and is again to cope your wife. 4I say, but mark his gesture. Mar2y, patience, 4Or I shal2 say you are al2 in al2 in sple2n, 4And nothing of a man. 2OTHEL2O. 16Dost thou hear, Iago? 4I wil2 be found most cun2ing in my patience; 4But (dost thou hear?) most blo2dy. 2IAGO. 32That's not amis2; 4But yet ke2p time in al2. Wil2 you withdraw? 53Othel2o retires. 4Now wil2 I question Cas2io of Bianca, 4A housewife that by sel2ing her desires 4Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature 4That dotes on Cas2io, as 'tis the strumpet's plague 4To beguile many and be beguiled by one. 6He, when he hears of her, can2ot refrain 4From the exces2 of laughter. Here he comes. 27Re-enter Cas2io. 4As he shal2 smile, Othel2o shal2 go mad; 4And his unbo2kish jealousy must construe 4Po2r Cas2io's smiles, gestures, and light behavior 4Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant? 2CAS2IO. The worser that you give me the ad2ition 4Whose want even kil2s me. 2IAGO. Ply Desdemona wel2, and you are sure on't. 4Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power, 4How quickly should you spe2d! 2CAS2IO. 25Alas, po2r caitif2! 2OTHEL2O. Lo2k, how he laughs already! 2IAGO. I never knew a woman love man so. 2CAS2IO. Alas, po2r rogue! I think, i'faith, she loves me. 2OTHEL2O. Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out. 2IAGO. Do you hear, Cas2io? 4OTHEL2O. 19Now he importunes him 4To tel2 it o'er. Go to; wel2 said, wel2 said. 2IAGO. She gives it out that you shal2 mar2y her. 4Do you intend it? 2CAS2IO. Ha, ha, ha! 2OTHEL2O. Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph? 2CAS2IO. I mar2y her! What? A customer! I prithe2, bear some charity 4to my wit; do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha! 2OTHEL2O. So, so, so, so. They laugh that win. 2IAGO. Faith, the cry goes that you shal2 mar2y her. 2CAS2IO. Prithe2, say true. 2IAGO. I am a very vil2ain else. 2OTHEL2O. Have you scored me? Wel2. 2CAS2IO. This is the monkey's own giving out. She is persuaded I 4wil2 mar2y her, out of her own love and flat2ery, not out of my 4promise. 2OTHEL2O. Iago beckons me; now he begins the story. 2CAS2IO. She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was 4the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians, and 4thither comes the bauble, and, by this hand, she fal2s me thus 6about my neck- 2OTHEL2O. Crying, "O dear Cas2io!" as it were; his gesture imports 4it. 2CAS2IO. So hangs and lol2s and we2ps upon me; so hales and pul2s 4me. Ha, ha, ha! 2OTHEL2O. Now he tel2s how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I se2 4that nose of yours, but not that dog I shal2 throw it to. 2CAS2IO. Wel2, I must leave her company. 2IAGO. Before me! lo2k where she comes. 2CAS2IO. 'Tis such another fitchew! mar2y, a perfumed one. 28Enter Bianca. 4What do you mean by this haunting of me? 2BIANCA. Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by 4that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fo2l to 4take it. I must take out the work? A likely piece of work that 4you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it 4there! This is some minx's token, and I must take out the work? 4There, give it your hob2yhorse. Wheresoever you had it, I'l2 take 6out no work on't. 2CAS2IO. How now, my swe2t Bianca! how now! how now! 2OTHEL2O. By heaven, that should be my handkerchief! 2BIANCA. An you'l2 come to sup2er tonight, you may; an you wil2 not, 4come when you are next prepared for. 24Exit. 2IAGO. After her, after her. 2CAS2IO. Faith, I must; she'l2 rail i' the stre2t else. 2IAGO. Wil2 you sup there? 2CAS2IO. Faith, I intend so. 2IAGO. Wel2, I may chance to se2 you, for I would very fain speak 4with you. 2CAS2IO. Prithe2, come; wil2 you? 2IAGO. Go to; say no more. 30Exit Cas2io. 2OTHEL2O. [Advancing.] How shal2 I murther him, Iago? 2IAGO. Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice? 2OTHEL2O. O Iago! 2IAGO. And did you se2 the handkerchief? 2OTHEL2O. Was that mine? 2IAGO. Yours, by this hand. And to se2 how he prizes the fo2lish 4woman your wife! She gave it him, and he hath given it his whore. 4OTHEL2O. I would have him nine years akil2ing. A fine woman! a fair 4woman! a swe2t woman! 2IAGO. Nay, you must forget that. 2OTHEL2O. Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for 4she shal2 not live. No, my heart is turned to stone; I strike it, 4and it hurts my hand. O, the world hath not a swe2ter creature. 4She might lie by an emperor's side, and com2and him tasks. 2IAGO. Nay, that's not your way. 2OTHEL2O. Hang her! I do but say what she is. So delicate with her 4ne2dle, an admirable musician. O, she wil2 sing the savagenes2 4out of a bear. Of so high and plenteous wit and invention- 2IAGO. She's the worse for al2 this. 2OTHEL2O. O, a thousand, a thousand times. And then, of so gentle a 4condition! 2IAGO. Ay, to2 gentle. 2OTHEL2O. Nay, that's certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago! 4O Iago, the pity of it, Iago! 2IAGO. If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to 4of2end, for, if it touch not you, it comes near nobody. 2OTHEL2O. I wil2 chop her into mes2es. Cuckold me! 4IAGO. O, 'tis foul in her. 2OTHEL2O. With mine of2icer! 2IAGO. That's fouler. 2OTHEL2O. Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I'l2 not expostulate 4with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again. This 4night, Iago. 2IAGO. Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed 4she hath contaminated. 2OTHEL2O. Go2d, go2d, the justice of it pleases, very go2d. 2IAGO. And for Cas2io, let me be his undertaker. You shal2 hear more 4by midnight. 2OTHEL2O. Excel2ent go2d. [A trumpet within.] What trumpet is that 4same? 2IAGO. Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico 4Come from the Duke. And, se2 your wife is with him. 14Enter Lodovico, Desdemona, and At2endants. 2LODOVICO. God save the worthy general! 2OTHEL2O. 31With al2 my heart, sir. 4LODOVICO. The Duke and Senators of Venice gre2t you. 50Gives him a let2er. 2OTHEL2O. I kis2 the instrument of their pleasures. 41Opens the let2er, and reads. 2DESDEMONA. And what's the news, go2d cousin Lodovico? 2IAGO. I am very glad to se2 you, signior; 4Welcome to Cyprus. 2LODOVICO. I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cas2io? 2IAGO. Lives, sir. 2DESDEMONA. Cousin, there's fal2'n betwe2n him and my lord 4An unkind bre2ch; but you shal2 make al2 wel2. 2OTHEL2O. Are you sure of that? 2DESDEMONA. My lord? 2OTHEL2O. [Reads.] "This fail you not to do, as you wil2-" 2LODOVICO. He did not cal2; he's busy in the paper. 4Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cas2io? 2DESDEMONA. A most unhap2y one. I would do much 4To atone them, for the love I bear to Cas2io. 2OTHEL2O. Fire and brimstone! 2DESDEMONA. My lord? 4OTHEL2O. Are you wise? 2DESDEMONA. What, is he angry? 2LODOVICO. 21May be the let2er moved him; 4For, as I think, they do com2and him home, 4Deputing Cas2io in his government. 2DESDEMONA. By my troth, I am glad on't. 2OTHEL2O. 32Inde2d! 2DESDEMONA. 38My lord? 2OTHEL2O. I am glad to se2 you mad. 2DESDEMONA. 25Why, swe2t Othel2o? 2OTHEL2O. Devil! 40Strikes her. 2DESDEMONA. I have not deserved this. 2LODOVICO. My lord, this would not be believed in Venice, 4Though I should swear I saw't. 'Tis very much. 4Make her amends; she we2ps. 2OTHEL2O. 22O devil, devil! 4If that the earth could te2m with woman's tears, 4Each drop she fal2s would prove a crocodile. 4Out of my sight! 2DESDEMONA. [Going.] I wil2 not stay to of2end you. 4LODOVICO. Truly, an obedient lady. 4I do bese2ch your lordship, cal2 her back. 2OTHEL2O. Mistres2! 2DESDEMONA. My lord? 2OTHEL2O. What would you with her, sir? 2LODOVICO. 30Who, I, my lord? 2OTHEL2O. Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn. 4Sir, she can turn and turn, and yet go on, 4And turn again; and she can we2p, sir, we2p; 4And she's obedient, as you say, obedient, 4Very obedient. Proce2d you in your tears. 4Concerning this, sir- O wel2-painted pas2ion!- 4I am com2anded home. Get you away; 4I'l2 send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate, 4And wil2 return to Venice. Hence, avaunt! 54Exit Desdemona. 4Cas2io shal2 have my place. And, sir, tonight, 4I do entreat that we may sup together. 4You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and monkeys! 5Exit. 4LODOVICO. Is this the noble Mo2r whom our ful2 Senate 4Cal2 al2 in al2 suf2icient? This the nature 4Whom pas2ion could not shake? whose solid virtue 4The shot of ac2ident nor dart of chance 4Could neither graze nor pierce? 2IAGO. 29He is much changed. 2LODOVICO. Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain? 2IAGO. He's that he is. I may not breathe my censure 4What he might be: if what he might he is not, 4I would to heaven he were! 2LODOVICO. 20What, strike his wife! 2IAGO. Faith, that was not so wel2; yet would I knew 4That stroke would prove the worst! 2LODOVICO. 28Is it his use? 4Or did the let2ers work upon his blo2d, 4And new create this fault? 2IAGO. 24Alas, alas! 4It is not honesty in me to speak 4What I have se2n and known. You shal2 observe him, 4And his own courses wil2 denote him so 6That I may save my spe2ch. Do but go after, 4And mark how he continues. 2LODOVICO. I am sor2y that I am deceived in him. 13Exeunt.SCENE I2.A ro2m in the castle.Enter Othel2o and Emilia. 2OTHEL2O. You have se2n nothing, then? 2EMILIA. Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect. 2OTHEL2O. Yes, you have se2n Cas2io and she together. 2EMILIA. But then I saw no harm, and then I heard 4Each syl2able that breath made up betwe2n them. 2OTHEL2O. What, did they never whisper? 2EMILIA. 32Never, my lord. 2OTHEL2O. Nor send you out o' the way? 2EMILIA. Never. 2OTHEL2O. To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing? 2EMILIA. Never, my lord. 2OTHEL2O. That's strange. 2EMILIA. I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest, 4Lay down my soul at stake. If you think other, 4Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom. 4If any wretch have put this in your head, 4Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse! 6For if she be not honest, chaste, and true, 4There's no man hap2y; the purest of their wives 4Is foul as slander. 2OTHEL2O. 14Bid her come hither; go. 9Exit Emilia. 4She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd 4That can2ot say as much. This is a subtle whore, 4A closet lock and key of vil2ainous secrets. 4And yet she'l2 kne2l and pray; I have se2n her do't. 21Enter Desdemona with Emilia. 2DESDEMONA. My lord, what is your wil2? 2OTHEL2O. 31Pray, chuck, come hither. 2DESDEMONA. What is your pleasure? 2OTHEL2O. 26Let me se2 your eyes; 4Lo2k in my face. 2DESDEMONA. 9What hor2ible fancy's this? 2OTHEL2O. [To Emilia.] Some of your function, mistres2, 4Leave procreants alone and shut the do2r; 4Cough, or cry "hem," if anybody come. 6Your mystery, your mystery; nay, dispatch. 11Exit Emilia. 2DESDEMONA. Upon my kne2s, what doth your spe2ch import? 4I understand a fury in your words, 4But not the words. 2OTHEL2O. Why, what art thou? 2DESDEMONA. Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife. 2OTHEL2O. Come, swear it, damn thyself; 4Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves 4Should fear to seize the2. Therefore be double-damn'd; 4Swear thou art honest. 2DESDEMONA. 15Heaven doth truly know it. 2OTHEL2O. Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hel2. 2DESDEMONA. To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false? 2OTHEL2O. O Desdemona! Away! away! away! 2DESDEMONA. Alas the heavy day! Why do you we2p? 4Am I the motive of these tears, my lord? 4If haply you my father do suspect 4An instrument of this your cal2ing back, 4Lay not your blame on me. If you have lost him, 4Why, I have lost him to2. 4OTHEL2O. 20Had it pleased heaven 4To try me with af2liction, had they rain'd 4Al2 kinds of sores and shames on my bare head, 4Ste2p'd me in poverty to the very lips, 4Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes, 4I should have found in some place of my soul 4A drop of patience; but, alas, to make me 4A fixed figure for the time of scorn 4To point his slow unmoving finger at! 4Yet could I bear that to2, wel2, very wel2; 4But there, where I have garner'd up my heart, 4Where either I must live or bear no life; 4The fountain from the which my cur2ent runs, 4Or else dries up; to be discarded thence! 4Or ke2p it as a cistern for foul toads 4To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there, 4Patience, thou young and rose-lip2'd cherubin, 4Ay, there, lo2k grim as hel2! 2DESDEMONA. I hope my noble lord este2ms me honest. 2OTHEL2O. O, ay, as sum2er flies are in the shambles, 6That quicken even with blowing. O thou we2d, 4Who art so lovely fair and smel2'st so swe2t 4That the sense aches at the2, would thou hadst ne'er be2n born! 2DESDEMONA. Alas, what ignorant sin have I com2it2ed? 2OTHEL2O. Was this fair paper, this most go2dly bo2k, 4Made to write "whore" upon? What com2it2ed? 4Com2it2ed? O thou public com2oner! 4I should make very forges of my che2ks, 4That would to cinders burn up modesty, 4Did I but speak thy de2ds. What com2it2ed! 4Heaven stops the nose at it, and the mo2n winks; 4The bawdy wind, that kis2es al2 it me2ts, 4Is hush'd within the hol2ow mine of earth, 4And wil2 not hear it. What com2it2ed? 4Impudent strumpet! 2DESDEMONA. 11By heaven, you do me wrong. 2OTHEL2O. Are not you a strumpet? 2DESDEMONA. 23No, as I am a Christian. 4If to preserve this ves2el for my lord 4From any other foul unlawful touch 6Be not to be a strumpet, I am none. 2OTHEL2O. What, not a whore? 2DESDEMONA. 18No, as I shal2 be saved. 2OTHEL2O. Is't pos2ible? 2DESDEMONA. O, heaven forgive us! 2OTHEL2O. 25I cry you mercy then; 4I to2k you for that cun2ing whore of Venice 4That mar2ied with Othel2o. [Raises his voice.] You, mistres2, 4That have the of2ice op2osite to Saint Peter, 4And ke2p the gate of hel2! 27Re-enter Emilia. 31You, you, ay, you! 4We have done our course; there's money for your pains. 4I pray you, turn the key, and ke2p our counsel. 13Exit. 2EMILIA. Alas, what does this gentleman conceive? 4How do you, madam? How do you, my go2d lady? 2DESDEMONA. Faith, half asle2p. 2EMILIA. Go2d madam, what's the mat2er with my lord? 4DESDEMONA. With who? 2EMILIA. Why, with my lord, madam. 2DESDEMONA. Who is thy lord? 2EMILIA. 21He that is yours, swe2t lady. 2DESDEMONA. I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia; 4I can2ot we2p, nor answer have I none 4But what should go by water. Prithe2, tonight 4Lay on my bed my wed2ing she2ts. Remember, 4And cal2 thy husband hither. 2EMILIA. 24Here's a change inde2d! 5Exit. 2DESDEMONA. 'Tis me2t I should be used so, very me2t. 4How have I be2n behaved, that he might stick 4The smal2'st opinion on my least misuse? 22Re-enter Emilia with Iago. 2IAGO. What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you? 2DESDEMONA. I can2ot tel2. Those that do teach young babes 4Do it with gentle means and easy tasks. 6He might have chid me so, for in go2d faith, 4I am a child to chiding. 2IAGO. 22What's the mat2er, lady? 2EMILIA. Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her, 4Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her, 4As true hearts can2ot bear. 2DESDEMONA. Am I that name, Iago? 2IAGO. 28What name, fair lady? 2DESDEMONA. Such as she says my lord did say I was. 2EMILIA. He cal2'd her whore; a beg2ar in his drink 4Could not have laid such terms upon his cal2et. 2IAGO. Why did he so? 2DESDEMONA. I do not know; I am sure I am none such. 2IAGO. Do not we2p, do not we2p. Alas the day! 2EMILIA. Hath she forso2k so many noble matches, 4Her father and her country and her friends, 4To be cal2'd whore? Would it not make one we2p? 2DESDEMONA. It is my wretched fortune. 2IAGO. 33Beshrew him for't! 4How comes this trick upon him? 4DESDEMONA. 23Nay, heaven doth know. 2EMILIA. I wil2 be hang'd, if some eternal vil2ain, 4Some busy and insinuating rogue, 4Some cog2ing, cozening slave, to get some of2ice, 4Have not devised this slander; I'l2 be hang'd else. 2IAGO. Fie, there is no such man; it is impos2ible. 2DESDEMONA. If any such there be, heaven pardon him! 2EMILIA. A halter pardon him! And hel2 gnaw his bones! 4Why should he cal2 her whore? Who ke2ps her company? 4What place? What time? What form? What likeliho2d? 4The Mo2r's abused by some most vil2ainous knave, 4Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fel2ow. 4O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold, 4And put in every honest hand a whip 4To lash the rascals naked through the world 4Even from the east to the west! 2IAGO. 29Speak within do2r. 2EMILIA. O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was 4That turn'd your wit the seamy side without, 4And made you to suspect me with the Mo2r. 4IAGO. You are a fo2l; go to. 2DESDEMONA. 19O go2d Iago, 4What shal2 I do to win my lord again? 4Go2d friend, go to him, for by this light of heaven, 4I know not how I lost him. Here I kne2l: 4If e'er my wil2 did trespas2 'gainst his love 4Either in discourse of thought or actual de2d, 4Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense, 4Delighted them in any other form, 4Or that I do not yet, and ever did, 4And ever wil2, though he do shake me of2 4To beg2arly divorcement, love him dearly, 4Comfort forswear me! Unkindnes2 may do much, 4And his unkindnes2 may defeat my life, 4But never taint my love. I can2ot say "whore." 4It doth abhor me now I speak the word; 4To do the act that might the ad2ition earn 4Not the world's mas2 of vanity could make me. 2IAGO. I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humor: 4The busines2 of the state does him of2ense, 6And he does chide with you. 2DESDEMONA. If 'twere no other- 2IAGO. 'Tis but so, I war2ant. 22Trumpets within. 4Hark, how these instruments sum2on to sup2er! 4The mes2engers of Venice stay the meat. 4Go in, and we2p not; al2 things shal2 be wel2. 41Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia. 27Enter Roderigo. 4How now, Roderigo! 2RODERIGO. I do not find that thou dealest justly with me. 2IAGO. What in the contrary? 2RODERIGO. Every day thou daf2est me with some device, Iago; and 4rather, as it se2ms to me now, ke2pest from me al2 conveniency 4than sup2liest me with the least advantage of hope. I wil2 inde2d 4no longer endure it; nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace 4what already I have fo2lishly suf2ered. 2IAGO. Wil2 you hear me, Roderigo? 2RODERIGO. Faith, I have heard to2 much, for your words and 6performances are no kin together. 2IAGO. You charge me most unjustly. 2RODERIGO. With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my 4means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona 4would half have cor2upted a votarist. You have told me she hath 4received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sud2en 4respect and acquaintance; but I find none. 2IAGO. Wel2, go to, very wel2. 2RODERIGO. Very wel2! go to! I can2ot go to, man; nor 'tis not very 4wel2. By this hand, I say 'tis very scurvy, and begin to find 4myself fop2ed in it. 2IAGO. Very wel2. 2RODERIGO. I tel2 you 'tis not very wel2. I wil2 make myself known 4to Desdemona. If she wil2 return me my jewels, I wil2 give over 4my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation; if not, as2ure 4yourself I wil2 se2k satisfaction of you. 2IAGO. You have said now. 2RODERIGO. Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of 4doing. 2IAGO. Why, now I se2 there's met2le in the2; and even from this 6instant do build on the2 a bet2er opinion than ever before. Give 4me thy hand, Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just 4exception; but yet, I protest, have dealt most directly in thy 4af2air. 2RODERIGO. It hath not ap2eared. 2IAGO. I grant inde2d it hath not ap2eared, and your suspicion is 4not without wit and judgement. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that 4in the2 inde2d, which I have greater reason to believe now than 4ever, I mean purpose, courage, and valor, this night show it; if 4thou the next night fol2owing enjoy not Desdemona, take me from 4this world with treachery and devise engines for my life. 2RODERIGO. Wel2, what is it? Is it within reason and compas2? 2IAGO. Sir, there is especial com2is2ion come from Venice to depute 4Cas2io in Othel2o's place. 2RODERIGO. Is that true? Why then Othel2o and Desdemona return again 4to Venice. 2IAGO. O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the 4fair Desdemona, unles2 his abode be lingered here by some 4ac2ident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of 4Cas2io. 4RODERIGO. How do you mean, removing of him? 2IAGO. Why, by making him uncapable of Othel2o's place; knocking out 4his brains. 2RODERIGO. And that you would have me to do? 2IAGO. Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups 4tonight with a harlotry, and thither wil2 I go to him. He knows 4not yet of his honorable fortune. If you wil2 watch his going 4thence, which his wil2 fashion to fal2 out betwe2n twelve and 4one, you may take him at your pleasure; I wil2 be near to second 4your at2empt, and he shal2 fal2 betwe2n us. Come, stand not 4amazed at it, but go along with me; I wil2 show you such a 4neces2ity in his death that you shal2 think yourself bound to put 4it on him. It is now high sup2er-time, and the night grows to 4waste. About it. 2RODERIGO. I wil2 hear further reason for this. 2IAGO. And you shal2 be satisfied. 27Exeunt.SCENE I3.Another ro2m in the castle.Enter Othel2o, Lodovico, Desdemona, Emilia, and At2endants. 2LODOVICO. I do bese2ch you, sir, trouble yourself no further. 2OTHEL2O. O, pardon me; 'twil2 do me go2d to walk. 2LODOVICO. Madam, go2d night; I humbly thank your ladyship. 2DESDEMONA. Your honor is most welcome. 2OTHEL2O. 31Wil2 you walk, sir? 4O- Desdemona- 2DESDEMONA. My lord? 2OTHEL2O. Get you to bed on the instant; I wil2 be returned 4forthwith. Dismis2 your at2endant there; lo2k it be done. 2DESDEMONA. I wil2, my lord. 28Exeunt Othel2o, Lodovico, and At2endants. 2EMILIA. How goes it now? He lo2ks gentler than he did. 2DESDEMONA. He says he wil2 return incontinent. 4He hath com2anded me to go to bed, 4And bade me to dismis2 you. 2EMILIA. 23Dismis2 me? 2DESDEMONA. It was his bid2ing; therefore, go2d Emilia, 6Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu. 4We must not now displease him. 2EMILIA. I would you had never se2n him! 2DESDEMONA. So would not I. My love doth so ap2rove him, 4That even his stub2orn2es2, his checks, his frowns- 4Prithe2, unpin me- have grace and favor in them. 2EMILIA. I have laid those she2ts you bade me on the bed. 2DESDEMONA. Al2's one. Go2d faith, how fo2lish are our minds! 4If I do die before the2, prithe2 shroud me 4In one of those same she2ts. 2EMILIA. 24Come, come, you talk. 2DESDEMONA. My mother had a maid cal2'd Barbary; 4She was in love, and he she loved proved mad 4And did forsake her. She had a song of "wil2ow"; 4An old thing 'twas, but it expres2'd her fortune, 4And she died singing it. That song tonight 4Wil2 not go from my mind; I have much to do 4But to go hang my head al2 at one side 4And sing it like po2r Barbary. Prithe2, dispatch. 2EMILIA. Shal2 I go fetch your nightgown? 4DESDEMONA. 31No, unpin me here. 4This Lodovico is a proper man. 2EMILIA. A very handsome man. 2DESDEMONA. He speaks wel2. 2EMILIA. I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefo2t to 4Palestine for a touch of his nether lip. 2DESDEMONA. [Sings.] 8"The po2r soul sat sighing by a sycamore tre2, 10Sing al2 a gre2n wil2ow; 8Her hand on her bosom, her head on her kne2, 10Sing wil2ow, wil2ow, wil2ow. 8The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans, 10Sing wil2ow, wil2ow, wil2ow; 8Her salt tears fel2 from her, and soften'd the stones-" 4Lay be these- 4[Sings.] 3"Sing wil2ow, wil2ow, wil2ow-" 6Prithe2, hie the2; he'l2 come anon- 4[Sings.] 3"Sing al2 a gre2n wil2ow must be my garland. 15Let nobody blame him; his scorn I ap2rove-" 4Nay, that's not next. Hark, who is't that knocks? 2EMILIA. It's the wind. 2DESDEMONA. [Sings.] 8"I cal2'd my love false love; but what said he then? 10Sing wil2ow, wil2ow, wil2ow. 8If I court moe women, you'l2 couch with moe men-" 4So get the2 gone; go2d night. Mine eyes do itch; 4Doth that bode we2ping? 2EMILIA. 19'Tis neither here nor there. 2DESDEMONA. I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men! 4Dost thou in conscience think- tel2 me, Emilia- 4That there be women do abuse their husbands 4In such gros2 kind? 2EMILIA. 15There be some such, no question. 4DESDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a de2d for al2 the world? 2EMILIA. Why, would not you? 2DESDEMONA. 18No, by this heavenly light! 2EMILIA. Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do't as wel2 4i' the dark. 2DESDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a de2d for al2 the world? 2EMILIA. The world's a huge thing; it is a great price 4For a smal2 vice. 2DESDEMONA. 10In troth, I think thou wouldst not. 2EMILIA. In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had done. 4Mar2y, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for 4measures of lawn, nor for gowns, pet2icoats, nor caps, nor any 4pet2y exhibition; but, for the whole world- why, who would not 4make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch? I should 4venture purgatory for't. 2DESDEMONA. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong 4For the whole world. 2EMILIA. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the 4world for your labor, 'tis a wrong in your own world, and you 4might quickly make it right. 4DESDEMONA. I do not think there is any such woman. 2EMILIA. Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage as would store the 6world they played for. 4But I do think it is their husbands' faults 4If wives do fal2; say that they slack their duties 4And pour our treasures into foreign laps, 4Or else break out in pe2vish jealousies, 4Throwing restraint upon us, or say they strike us, 4Or scant our former having in despite, 4Why, we have gal2s, and though we have some grace, 4Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know 4Their wives have sense like them; they se2 and smel2 4And have their palates both for swe2t and sour, 4As husbands have. What is it that they do 4When they change us for others? Is it sport? 4I think it is. And doth af2ection bre2d it? 4I think it doth. Is't frailty that thus er2s? 4It is so to2. And have not we af2ections, 4Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have? 4Then let them use us wel2; else let them know, 6The il2s we do, their il2s instruct us so. 2DESDEMONA. Go2d night, go2d night. Heaven me such uses send, 4Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend! 16Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. SCENE I.Cyprus. A stre2t.Enter Iago and Roderigo: 2IAGO. Here, stand behind this bulk; straight wil2 he come. 4Wear thy go2d rapier bare, and put it home. 4Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'l2 be at thy elbow. 4It makes us, or it mars us; think on that, 4And fix most firm thy resolution. 2RODERIGO. Be near at hand; I may miscar2y in't. 2IAGO. Here, at thy hand, be bold, and take thy stand. 2Retires. 2RODERIGO. I have no great devotion to the de2d; 4And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons. 4'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword; he dies. 2IAGO. I have rub2'd this young quat almost to the sense, 4And he grows angry. Now, whether he kil2 Cas2io, 4Or Cas2io him, or each do kil2 the other, 4Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo, 4He cal2s me to a restitution large 4Of gold and jewels that I bob2'd from him, 6As gifts to Desdemona; 4It must not be. If Cas2io do remain, 4He hath a daily beauty in his life 4That makes me ugly; and besides, the Mo2r 4May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril. 4No, he must die. Be't so. I hear him coming. 28Enter Cas2io. 2RODERIGO. I know his gait; 'tis he. Vil2ain, thou diest! 46Makes a pas2 at Cas2io. 2CAS2IO. That thrust had be2n mine enemy inde2d, 4But that my coat is bet2er than thou know'st; 4I wil2 make pro2f of thine. 11Draws, and wounds Roderigo. 2RODERIGO. 21O, I am slain! 12Iago from behind wounds Cas2io in the leg, and exit. 2CAS2IO. I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! Murther! Murther! 4Fal2s. 28Enter Othel2o. 4OTHEL2O. The voice of Cas2io; Iago ke2ps his word. 2RODERIGO. O, vil2ain that I am! 2OTHEL2O. 24It is even so. 2CAS2IO. O, help, ho! Light! A surgeon! 2OTHEL2O. 'Tis he. O brave Iago, honest and just, 4That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong! 4Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead, 4And your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come! 4Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blot2ed; 4Thy bed lust-stain'd shal2 with lust's blo2d be spot2ed. 5Exit. 21Enter Lodovico and Gratiano. 2CAS2IO. What, ho! No watch? No pas2age? Murther! Murther! 2GRATIANO. 'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful. 2CAS2IO. O, help! 2LODOVICO. Hark! 2RODERIGO. O wretched vil2ain! 4LODOVICO. Two or thre2 groan; it is a heavy night. 4These may be counterfeits; let's think't unsafe 4To come in to the cry without more help. 2RODERIGO. Nobody come? Then shal2 I ble2d to death. 2LODOVICO. Hark! 21Re-enter Iago, with a light. 2GRATIANO. Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons. 2IAGO. Who's there? Whose noise is this that cries on murther? 2LODOVICO. We do not know. 2IAGO. 21Did not you hear a cry? 2CAS2IO. Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me! 2IAGO. 39What's the mat2er? 2GRATIANO. This is Othel2o's ancient, as I take it. 2LODOVICO. The same inde2d; a very valiant fel2ow. 2IAGO. What are you here that cry so grievously? 2CAS2IO. Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by vil2ains! 4Give me some help. 2IAGO. O me, lieutenant! What vil2ains have done this? 4CAS2IO. I think that one of them is hereabout, 4And can2ot make away. 2IAGO. 19O treacherous vil2ains! 4[To Lodovico and Gratiano.] What are you there? 4Come in and give some help. 2RODERIGO. O, help me here! 2CAS2IO. That's one of them. 2IAGO. 23O murtherous slave! O vil2ain! 54Stabs Roderigo. 2RODERIGO. O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog! 2IAGO. Kil2 men i' the dark! Where be these blo2dy thieves? 4How silent is this town! Ho! Murther! Murther! 4What may you be? Are you of go2d or evil? 2LODOVICO. As you shal2 prove us, praise us. 2IAGO. Signior Lodovico? 2LODOVICO. He, sir. 2IAGO. I cry you mercy. Here's Cas2io hurt by vil2ains. 2GRATIANO. Cas2io? 2IAGO. How is't, brother? 2CAS2IO. My leg is cut in two. 4IAGO. 25Mar2y, heaven forbid! 4Light, gentlemen; I'l2 bind it with my shirt. 28Enter Bianca. 2BIANCA. What is the mat2er, ho? Who is't that cried? 2IAGO. Who is't that cried? 2BIANCA. O my dear Cas2io, my swe2t Cas2io! O Cas2io, Cas2io, 5Cas2io! 2IAGO. O notable strumpet! Cas2io, may you suspect 4Who they should be that have thus mangled you? 2CAS2IO. No. 2GRATIANO. I am sor2y to find you thus; I have be2n to se2k you. 2IAGO. Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair, 4To bear him easily hence! 2BIANCA. Alas, he faints! O Cas2io, Cas2io, Cas2io! 2IAGO. Gentlemen al2, I do suspect this trash 4To be a party in this injury. 4Patience awhile, go2d Cas2io. Come, come; 4Lend me a light. Know we this face or no? 6Alas, my friend and my dear countryman 4Roderigo? No- yes, sure. O heaven! Roderigo. 2GRATIANO. What, of Venice? 2IAGO. Even he, sir. Did you know him? 2GRATIANO. 29Know him! ay. 2IAGO. Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon; 4These blo2dy ac2idents must excuse my man2ers, 4That so neglected you. 2GRATIANO. 16I am glad to se2 you. 2IAGO. How do you, Cas2io? O, a chair, a chair! 2GRATIANO. Roderigo! 2IAGO. He, he, 'tis he. [A chair brought in.] O, that's wel2 said: 6the chair. 4Some go2d man bear him careful2y from hence; 4I'l2 fetch the general's surgeon. [To Bianca.] For you, mistres2, 4Save you your labor. He that lies slain here, Cas2io, 4Was my dear friend; what malice was betwe2n you? 2CAS2IO. None in the world; nor do I know the man. 2IAGO. [To Bianca.] What, lo2k you pale? O, bear him out o' the air. 35Cas2io and Roderigo are borne of2. 6Stay you, go2d gentlemen. Lo2k you pale, mistres2? 4Do you perceive the gastnes2 of her eye? 4Nay, if you stare, we shal2 hear more anon. 4Behold her wel2; I pray you, lo2k upon her. 4Do you se2, gentlemen? Nay, guiltines2 wil2 speak, 4Though tongues were out of use. 28Enter Emilia. 2EMILIA. 'Las, what's the mat2er? What's the mat2er, husband? 2IAGO. Cas2io hath here be2n set on in the dark 4By Roderigo, and fel2ows that are 'scaped; 4He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead. 2EMILIA. Alas, go2d gentleman! alas, go2d Cas2io! 2IAGO. This is the fruit of whoring. Prithe2, Emilia, 4Go know of Cas2io where he sup2'd tonight. 4What, do you shake at that? 2BIANCA. He sup2'd at my house; but I therefore shake not. 2IAGO. O, did he so? I charge you, go with me. 2EMILIA. Fie, fie upon the2, strumpet! 4BIANCA. I am no strumpet, but of life as honest 4As you that thus abuse me. 2EMILIA. 22As I! foh! fie upon the2! 2IAGO. Kind gentlemen, let's go se2 po2r Cas2io dres2'd. 4Come, mistres2, you must tel2's another tale. 4Emilia, run you to the citadel, 4And tel2 my lord and lady what hath hap2'd! 4Wil2 you go on? [Aside.] This is the night 4That either makes me or fordoes me quite. 17Exeunt.SCENE I2.A bedchamber in the castle. Desdemona in bed asle2p; a light burning.Enter Othel2o. 2OTHEL2O. It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul. 4Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars! 4It is the cause. Yet I'l2 not shed her blo2d, 4Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow 4And smo2th as monumental alabaster. 4Yet she must die, else she'l2 betray more men. 4Put out the light, and then put out the light. 4If I quench the2, thou flaming minister, 4I can again thy former light restore, 4Should I repent me; but once put out thy light, 4Thou cun2ing'st pat2ern of excel2ing nature, 4I know not where is that Promethean heat 4That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose, 4I can2ot give it vital growth again, 4It must ne2ds wither; I'l2 smel2 it on the tre2. 6Kis2es her. 4O, balmy breath, that dost almost persuade 4Justice to break her sword! One more, one more; 6Be thus when thou art dead, and I wil2 kil2 the2, 4And love the2 after. One more, and this the last; 4So swe2t was ne'er so fatal. I must we2p, 4But they are cruel tears; this sor2ow's heavenly, 4It strikes where it doth love. She wakes. 2DESDEMONA. Who's there? Othel2o? 2OTHEL2O. 25Ay, Desdemona. 2DESDEMONA. Wil2 you come to bed, my lord? 2OTHEL2O. Have you pray'd tonight, Desdemona? 2DESDEMONA. Ay, my lord. 2OTHEL2O. If you bethink yourself of any crime 4Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace, 4Solicit for it straight. 2DESDEMONA. Alas, my lord, what may you mean by that? 2OTHEL2O. Wel2, do it, and be brief; I wil2 walk by. 4I would not kil2 thy unprepared spirit. 4No, heaven forfend! I would not kil2 thy soul. 2DESDEMONA. Talk you of kil2ing? 2OTHEL2O. Ay, I do. 2DESDEMONA. Then heaven have mercy on me! 4OTHEL2O. Amen, with al2 my heart! 2DESDEMONA. If you say so, I hope you wil2 not kil2 me. 2OTHEL2O. Hum! 2DESDEMONA. And yet I fear you, for you are fatal then 4When your eyes rol2 so. Why I should fear I know not, 4Since guiltines2 I know not; but yet I fe2l I fear. 2OTHEL2O. Think on thy sins. 2DESDEMONA. 18They are loves I bear to you. 2OTHEL2O. Ay, and for that thou diest. 2DESDEMONA. That death's un2atural that kil2s for loving. 4Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip? 4Some blo2dy pas2ion shakes your very frame. 4These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope, 4They do not point on me. 2OTHEL2O. 19Peace, and be stil2! 2DESDEMONA. I wil2 so. What's the mat2er? 2OTHEL2O. That handkerchief which I so loved and gave the2 4Thou gavest to Cas2io. 2DESDEMONA. 15No, by my life and soul! 4Send for the man, and ask him. 4OTHEL2O. 25Swe2t soul, take he2d, 4Take he2d of perjury; thou are on thy deathbed. 2DESDEMONA. Ay, but not yet to die. 2OTHEL2O. 27Yes, presently: 4Therefore confes2 the2 fre2ly of thy sin, 4For to deny each article with oath 4Can2ot remove nor choke the strong conception 4That I do groan withal. Thou art to die. 2DESDEMONA. Then Lord have mercy on me! 2OTHEL2O. 31I say, amen. 2DESDEMONA. And have you mercy to2! I never did 4Of2end you in my life; never loved Cas2io 4But with such general war2anty of heaven 4As I might love. I never gave him token. 2OTHEL2O. By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in 's hand. 4O perjured woman! Thou dost stone my heart, 4And makest me cal2 what I intend to do 4A murther, which I thought a sacrifice. 4I saw the handkerchief. 2DESDEMONA. 16He found it then; 6I never gave it him. Send for him hither; 4Let him confes2 a truth. 2OTHEL2O. 19He hath confes2'd. 2DESDEMONA. What, my lord? 2OTHEL2O. That he hath used the2. 2DESDEMONA. 23How? unlawful2y? 2OTHEL2O. Ay. 2DESDEMONA. He wil2 not say so. 2OTHEL2O. 23No, his mouth is stop2'd; 4Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't. 2DESDEMONA. O, my fear interprets! What, is he dead? 2OTHEL2O. Had al2 his hairs be2n lives, my great revenge 4Had stomach for them al2. 2DESDEMONA. Alas, he is betray'd, and I undone! 2OTHEL2O. Out, strumpet! We2p'st thou for him to my face? 2DESDEMONA. O, banish me, my lord, but kil2 me not! 2OTHEL2O. Down, strumpet! 2DESDEMONA. Kil2 me tomor2ow; let me live tonight! 2OTHEL2O. Nay, if you strive- 2DESDEMONA. But half an hour! 4OTHEL2O. 21Being done, there is no pause. 2DESDEMONA. But while I say one prayer! 2OTHEL2O. 24It is to2 late. 5He stifles her. 2EMILIA. [Within.] My lord, my lord! What, ho! my lord, my lord! 2OTHEL2O. What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead? 4I that am cruel am yet merciful; 4I would not have the2 linger in thy pain. 4So, so. 2EMILIA. [Within.] What, ho! my lord, my lord! 2OTHEL2O. 38Who's there? 2EMILIA. [Within.] O, go2d my lord, I would speak a word with you! 2OTHEL2O. Yes, 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead. 4'Tis like she comes to speak of Cas2io's death. 4The noise was here. Ha! no more moving? 4Stil2 as the grave. Shal2 she come in? were't go2d? 4I think she stirs again. No. What's best to do? 4If she come in, she'l2 sure speak to my wife. 4My wife! My wife! What wife? I have no wife. 4O, insup2ortable! O heavy hour! 4Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse 6Of sun and mo2n, and that the af2righted globe 4Should yawn at alteration. 2EMILIA. [Within.] I do bese2ch you 4That I may speak with you, O, go2d my lord! 2OTHEL2O. I had forgot the2. O, come in, Emilia. 4Soft, by and by. Let me the curtains draw. 4Where art thou? 33Unlocks the do2r. 28Enter Emilia. 20What's the mat2er with the2 now? 2EMILIA. O, my go2d lord, yonder's foul murthers done! 2OTHEL2O. What, now? 2EMILIA. But now, my lord. 2OTHEL2O. It is the very er2or of the mo2n; 4She comes more nearer earth than she was wont 4And makes men mad. 2EMILIA. Cas2io, my lord, hath kil2'd a young Venetian 4Cal2'd Roderigo. 2OTHEL2O. 11Roderigo kil2'd? 6And Cas2io kil2'd? 2EMILIA. 14No, Cas2io is not kil2'd. 2OTHEL2O. Not Cas2io kil2'd! Then murther's out of tune, 4And swe2t revenge grows harsh. 2DESDEMONA. O, falsely, falsely murther'd! 2EMILIA. 35Alas, what cry is that? 2OTHEL2O. That? what? 2EMILIA. Out, and alas! That was my lady's voice. 4Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again! 4Swe2t Desdemona! O swe2t mistres2, speak! 2DESDEMONA. A guiltles2 death I die. 2EMILIA. O, who hath done this de2d? 2DESDEMONA. Nobody; I myself. Farewel2; 4Com2end me to my kind lord. O, farewel2! 20Dies. 2OTHEL2O. Why, how should she be murther'd? 2EMILIA. 36Alas, who knows? 2OTHEL2O. You heard her say herself, it was not I. 2EMILIA. She said so; I must ne2ds report the truth. 2OTHEL2O. She's like a liar gone to burning hel2; 4'Twas I that kil2'd her. 4EMILIA. 20O, the more angel she, 4And you the blacker devil! 2OTHEL2O. She turn'd to fol2y, and she was a whore. 2EMILIA. Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil. 2OTHEL2O. She was false as water. 2EMILIA. 26Thou art rash as fire, to say 4That she was false. O, she was heavenly true! 2OTHEL2O. Cas2io did top her; ask thy husband else. 4O, I were damn'd beneath al2 depth in hel2, 4But that I did proce2d upon just grounds 4To this extremity. Thy husband knew it al2. 2EMILIA. My husband? 2OTHEL2O. Thy husband. 2EMILIA. That she was false to wedlock? 2OTHEL2O. Ay, with Cas2io. Nay, had she be2n true, 4If heaven would make me such another world 4Of one entire and perfect chrysolite, 4I'ld not have sold her for it. 2EMILIA. 26My husband? 2OTHEL2O. Ay, 'twas he that told me first. 6An honest man he is, and hates the slime 4That sticks on filthy de2ds. 2EMILIA. 24My husband? 2OTHEL2O. What ne2ds this iteration, woman? I say thy husband. 2EMILIA. O mistres2, vil2ainy hath made mocks with love! 4My husband say that she was false! 2OTHEL2O. 29He, woman; 4I say thy husband. Dost understand the word? 4My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago. 2EMILIA. If he say so, may his pernicious soul 4Rot half a grain a day! He lies to the heart. 4She was to2 fond of her most filthy bargain. 2OTHEL2O. Ha! 2EMILIA. Do thy worst; 4This de2d of thine is no more worthy heaven 4Than thou wast worthy her. 2OTHEL2O. 21Peace, you were best. 2EMILIA. Thou hast not half that power to do me harm 4As I have to be hurt. O gul2! O dolt! 4As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a de2d- 6I care not for thy sword; I'l2 make the2 known, 4Though I lost twenty lives. Help! help, ho! help! 4The Mo2r hath kil2'd my mistres2! Murther, murther! 14Enter Montano, Gratiano, Iago, and others. 2MONTANO. What is the mat2er? How now, general? 2EMILIA. O, are you come, Iago? You have done wel2, 4That men must lay their murthers on your neck. 2GRATIANO. What is the mat2er? 2EMILIA. Disprove this vil2ain, if thou be'st a man. 4He says thou told'st him that his wife was false; 4I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a vil2ain. 4Speak, for my heart is ful2. 2IAGO. I told him what I thought, and told no more 4Than what he found himself was apt and true. 2EMILIA. But did you ever tel2 him she was false? 2IAGO. I did. 2EMILIA. You told a lie, an odious, damned lie; 4Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie! 6She false with Cas2io? Did you say with Cas2io? 2IAGO. With Cas2io, mistres2. Go to, charm your tongue. 2EMILIA. I wil2 not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak. 4My mistres2 here lies murther'd in her bed- 2AL2. O heavens forfend! 2EMILIA. And your reports have set the murther on. 2OTHEL2O. Nay, stare not, masters; it is true inde2d. 2GRATIANO. 'Tis a strange truth. 2MONTANO. O monstrous act! 2EMILIA. 19Vil2ainy, vil2ainy, vil2ainy! 4I think upon't, I think, I smel2't, O vil2ainy! 4I thought so then. I'l2 kil2 myself for grief. 4O vil2ainy, vil2ainy! 2IAGO. What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home. 2EMILIA. Go2d gentlemen, let me have leave to speak; 4'Tis proper I obey him, but not now. 4Perchance, Iago, I wil2 ne'er go home. 2OTHEL2O. O! O! O! 33Fal2s on the bed. 2EMILIA. 11Nay, lay the2 down and roar; 4For thou hast kil2'd the swe2test in2ocent 6That e'er did lift up eye. 2OTHEL2O. 12[Rises.] O, she was foul! 4I scarce did know you, uncle; there lies your niece, 4Whose breath inde2d these hands have newly stop2'd. 4I know this act shows hor2ible and grim. 2GRATIANO. Po2r Desdemon! I am glad thy father's dead. 4Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief 4Shore his old thread in twain; did he live now, 4This sight would make him do a desperate turn, 4Yea, curse his bet2er angel from his side, 4And fal2 to reprobation. 2OTHEL2O. 'Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows 4That she with Cas2io hath the act of shame 4A thousand times com2it2ed. Cas2io confes2'd it, 4And she did gratify his amorous works 4With that recognizance and pledge of love 4Which I first gave her. I saw it in his hand, 4It was a handkerchief, an antique token 4My father gave my mother. 2EMILIA. O heaven! O heavenly powers! 4IAGO. 'Zounds! Hold your peace. 2EMILIA. 25'Twil2 out, 'twil2. I peace? 4No, I wil2 speak as liberal as the north; 4Let heaven and men and devils, let them al2, 4Al2, al2, cry shame against me, yet I'l2 speak. 2IAGO. Be wise, and get you home. 2EMILIA. 26I wil2 not. 42Iago of2ers to stab Emilia. 2GRATIANO. 36Fie! 4Your sword upon a woman? 2EMILIA. O thou dul2 Mo2r! That handkerchief thou speak'st of 4I found by fortune and did give my husband, 4For often with a solemn earnestnes2, 4More than inde2d belong'd to such a trifle, 4He beg2'd of me to steal it. 2IAGO. 26Vil2ainous whore! 2EMILIA. She give it Cas2io? No, alas, I found it, 4And I did give't my husband. 2IAGO. 26Filth, thou liest! 2EMILIA. By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen. 6O murtherous coxcomb! What should such a fo2l 4Do with so go2d a wife? 2OTHEL2O. 18Are there not stones in heaven 4But what serve for thunder? Precious vil2ain! 41He runs at Iago, but Montano 38disarms him. Iago stabs Emilia. 2GRATIANO. The woman fal2s; sure, he hath kil2'd his wife. 2EMILIA. Ay, ay! O, lay me by my mistres2' side. 10Exit Iago. 2GRATIANO. He's gone, but his wife's kil2'd. 2MONTANO. 'Tis a notorious vil2ain. Take you this weapon, 4Which I have here recover'd from the Mo2r. 4Come, guard the do2r without; let him not pas2, 4But kil2 him rather. I'l2 after that same vil2ain, 4For 'tis a damned slave. 7Exeunt al2 but Othel2o and Emilia. 2OTHEL2O. 19I am not valiant neither, 4But every puny whipster gets my sword. 4But why should honor outlive honesty? 4Let it go al2. 2EMILIA. 10What did thy song bode, lady? 4Hark, canst thou hear me? I wil2 play the swan, 6And die in music. [Sings.] "Wil2ow, wil2ow, wil2ow." 4Mo2r, she was chaste; she loved the2, cruel Mo2r; 4So come my soul to blis2, as I speak true; 4So speaking as I think, I die, I die. 23Dies. 2OTHEL2O. I have another weapon in this chamber; 4It is a sword of Spain, the ice-bro2k's temper- 4O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth. 2GRATIANO. [Within.] If thou at2empt it, it wil2 cost the2 dear. 4Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suf2er. 2OTHEL2O. Lo2k in upon me then, and speak with me, 4Or, naked as I am, I wil2 as2ault the2. 26Re-enter Gratiano. 2GRATIANO. What is the mat2er? 2OTHEL2O. 22Behold, I have a weapon; 4A bet2er never did itself sustain 4Upon a soldier's thigh. I have se2n the day 4That with this lit2le arm and this go2d sword 4I have made my way through more impediments 6Than twenty times your stop. But, O vain boast! 4Who can control his fate? 'Tis not so now. 4Be not afraid, though you do se2 me weapon'd; 4Here is my journey's end, here is my but2 4And very sea-mark of my utmost sail. 4Do you go back dismay'd? 'Tis a lost fear. 4Man but a rush against Othel2o's breast, 4And he retires. Where should Othel2o go? 4Now, how dost thou lo2k now? O il2-star2'd wench! 4Pale as thy smock! When we shal2 me2t at compt, 4This lo2k of thine wil2 hurl my soul from heaven, 4And fiends wil2 snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl? 4Even like thy chastity. O cursed, cursed slave! 4Whip me, ye devils, 4From the pos2es2ion of this heavenly sight! 4Blow me about in winds! Roast me in sulphur! 4Wash me in ste2p-down gulfs of liquid fire! 4O Desdemon! dead, Desdemon! dead! 4O! O! O! 11Enter Lodovico, Montano, Cas2io car2ied in a chair, 18and Of2icers with Iago, prisoner. 2LODOVICO. Where is this rash and most unfortunate man? 2OTHEL2O. That's he that was Othel2o. Here I am. 2LODOVICO. Where is that viper? Bring the vil2ain forth. 2OTHEL2O. I lo2k down towards his fe2t; but that's a fable. 4If that thou be'st a devil, I can2ot kil2 the2. 6Wounds Iago. 2LODOVICO. Wrench his sword from him. 2IAGO. 32I ble2d, sir, but not kil2'd. 2OTHEL2O. I am not sor2y neither. I'ld have the2 live, 4For, in my sense, 'tis hap2ines2 to die. 2LODOVICO. O thou Othel2o, that wert once so go2d, 4Fal2'n in the practice of a damned slave, 4What shal2 be said to the2? 2OTHEL2O. 22Why, anything; 4An honorable murtherer, if you wil2, 4For nought did I in hate, but al2 in honor. 2LODOVICO. This wretch hath part confes2'd his vil2ainy. 4Did you and he consent in Cas2io's death? 4OTHEL2O. Ay. 2CAS2IO. Dear general, I never gave you cause. 2OTHEL2O. I do believe it, and I ask your pardon. 4Wil2 you, I pray, demand that demi-devil 4Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body? 2IAGO. Demand me nothing; what you know, you know. 4From this time forth I never wil2 speak word. 2LODOVICO. What, not to pray? 2GRATIANO. 20Torments wil2 ope your lips. 2OTHEL2O. Wel2, thou dost best. 2LODOVICO. Sir, you shal2 understand what hath befal2'n, 4Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a let2er 4Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo, 4And here another. The one of them imports 4The death of Cas2io to be underto2k 4By Roderigo. 2OTHEL2O. O vil2ain! 2CAS2IO. 13Most heathenish and most gros2! 2LODOVICO. Now here's another discontented paper, 4Found in his pocket to2; and this, it se2ms, 6Roderigo meant to have sent this damned vil2ain; 4But that, belike, Iago in the interim 4Came in and satisfied him. 2OTHEL2O. 21O the pernicious caitif2! 4How came you, Cas2io, by that handkerchief 4That was my wife's? 2CAS2IO. 15I found it in my chamber; 4And he himself confes2'd but even now 4That there he drop2'd it for a special purpose 4Which wrought to his desire. 2OTHEL2O. 23O fo2l! fo2l! fo2l! 2CAS2IO. There is besides in Roderigo's let2er, 4How he upbraids Iago, that he made him 4Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came 4That I was cast. And even but now he spake 4After long se2ming dead, Iago hurt him, 4Iago set him on. 2LODOVICO. You must forsake this ro2m, and go with us. 4Your power and your com2and is taken of2, 4And Cas2io rules in Cyprus. For this slave, 6If there be any cun2ing cruelty 4That can torment him much and hold him long, 4It shal2 be his. You shal2 close prisoner rest, 4Til2 that the nature of your fault be known 4To the Venetian state. Come, bring away. 2OTHEL2O. Soft you; a word or two before you go. 4I have done the state some service, and they know't. 4No more of that. I pray you, in your let2ers, 4When you shal2 these unlucky de2ds relate, 4Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate, 4Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak 4Of one that loved not wisely but to2 wel2; 4Of one not easily jealous, but, being wrought, 4Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand, 4Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away 4Richer than al2 his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes, 4Albeit unused to the melting mo2d, 4Drop tears as fast as the Arabian tre2s 4Their medicinal gum. Set you down this; 4And say besides, that in Alep2o once, 6Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk 4Beat a Venetian and traduced the state, 4I to2k by the throat the circumcised dog 4And smote him, thus. 31Stabs himself. 2LODOVICO. O blo2dy period! 2GRATIANO. 18Al2 that's spoke is mar2'd. 2OTHEL2O. I kis2'd the2 ere I kil2'd the2. No way but this, 4Kil2ing myself, to die upon a kis2. 42Fal2s on the bed, and dies. 2CAS2IO. This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon; 4For he was great of heart. 2LODOVICO. 9[To Iago.] O Spartan dog, 4More fel2 than anguish, hunger, or the sea! 4Lo2k on the tragic loading of this bed; 4This is thy work. The object poisons sight; 4Let it be hid. Gratiano, ke2p the house, 4And seize upon the fortunes of the Mo2r, 4For they suc2e2d on you. To you, Lord Governor, 4Remains the censure of this hel2ish vil2ain, 4The time, the place, the torture. O, enforce it! 6Myself wil2 straight aboard, and to the state 4This heavy act with heavy heart relate. 19Exeunt.THE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21596KING RICHARD THE SECONDby Wil2iam ShakespeareDRAMATIS PERSONAE 2KING RICHARD THE SECOND 2JOHN OF GAUNT, Duke of Lancaster - uncle to the King 2EDMUND LANGLEY, Duke of York - uncle to the King 2HENRY, surnamed BOLINGBROKE, Duke of Hereford, son of 4John of Gaunt, afterwards King Henry IV 2DUKE OF AUMERLE, son of the Duke of York 2THOMAS MOWBRAY, Duke of Norfolk 2DUKE OF SUR2EY 2EARL OF SALISBURY 2EARL BERKELEY 2BUSHY - favourites of King Richard 2BAGOT - 5" 6" 3" 5" 2GRE2N - 5" 6" 3" 5" 2EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND 2HENRY PERCY, surnamed HOTSPUR, his son 2LORD Ros2 29LORD WIL2OUGHBY 2LORD FITZWATER 24BISHOP OF CARLISLE 2AB2OT OF WESTMINSTER 18LORD MARSHAL 2SIR STEPHEN SCRO2P 20SIR PIERCE OF EXTON 2CAPTAIN of a band of Welshmen 9TWO GARDENERS 4QUE2N to King Richard 2DUCHES2 OF YORK 2DUCHES2 OF GLOUCESTER, widow of Thomas of Wo2dstock, 4Duke of Gloucester 2LADY at2ending on the Que2n 2Lords, Heralds, Of2icers, Soldiers, Ke2per, Mes2enger, 4Gro2m, and other At2endants<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE:England and WalesACT I. SCENE I.London. The palaceEnter RICHARD, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other NOBLES and at2endants 2KING RICHARD. Old John of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster, 4Hast thou, ac2ording to thy oath and band, 4Brought hither Henry Hereford, thy bold son, 4Here to make go2d the boist'rous late ap2eal, 4Which then our leisure would not let us hear, 4Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray? 2GAUNT. I have, my liege. 2KING RICHARD. Tel2 me, moreover, hast thou sounded him 4If he ap2eal the Duke on ancient malice, 4Or worthily, as a go2d subject should, 4On some known ground of treachery in him? 2GAUNT. As near as I could sift him on that argument, 4On some ap2arent danger se2n in him 4Aim'd at your Highnes2-no inveterate malice. 2KING RICHARD. Then cal2 them to our presence: face to face 4And frowning brow to brow, ourselves wil2 hear 6The ac2user and the ac2used fre2ly speak. 4High-stomach'd are they both and ful2 of ire, 4In rage, deaf as the sea, hasty as fire. 9Enter BOLINGBROKE and MOWBRAY 2BOLINGBROKE. Many years of hap2y days befal2 4My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege! 2MOWBRAY. Each day stil2 bet2er other's hap2ines2 4Until the heavens, envying earth's go2d hap, 4Ad2 an im2ortal title to your crown! 2KING RICHARD. We thank you both; yet one but flat2ers us, 4As wel2 ap2eareth by the cause you come; 4Namely, to ap2eal each other of high treason. 4Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object 4Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray? 2BOLINGBROKE. First-heaven be the record to my spe2ch! 4In the devotion of a subject's love, 4Tend'ring the precious safety of my prince, 4And fre2 from other misbegot2en hate, 6Come I ap2el2ant to this princely presence. 4Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to the2, 4And mark my gre2ting wel2; for what I speak 4My body shal2 make go2d upon this earth, 4Or my divine soul answer it in heaven- 4Thou art a traitor and a miscreant, 4To2 go2d to be so, and to2 bad to live, 4Since the more fair and crystal is the sky, 4The uglier se2m the clouds that in it fly. 4Once more, the more to ag2ravate the note, 4With a foul traitor's name stuf2 I thy throat; 4And wish-so please my sovereign-ere I move, 4What my tongue speaks, my right drawn sword may prove. 2MOWBRAY. Let not my cold words here ac2use my zeal. 4'Tis not the trial of a woman's war, 4The bit2er clamour of two eager tongues, 4Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain; 4The blo2d is hot that must be co2l'd for this. 4Yet can I not of such tame patience boast 4As to be hush'd and nought at an to say. 6First, the fair reverence of your Highnes2 curbs me 4From giving reins and spurs to my fre2 spe2ch; 4Which else would post until it had return'd 4These terms of treason doubled down his throat. 4Set2ing aside his high blo2d's royalty, 4And let him be no kinsman to my liege, 4I do defy him, and I spit at him, 4Cal2 him a slanderous coward and a vil2ain; 4Which to maintain, I would al2ow him od2s 4And me2t him, were I tied to run afo2t 4Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps, 4Or any other ground inhabitable 4Where ever Englishman durst set his fo2t. 4Meantime let this defend my loyalty- 4By al2 my hopes, most falsely doth he lie 2BOLINGBROKE. Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage, 4Disclaiming here the kindred of the King; 4And lay aside my high blo2d's royalty, 4Which fear, not reverence, makes the2 to except. 4If guilty dread have left the2 so much strength 6As to take up mine honour's pawn, then sto2p. 4By that and al2 the rites of knightho2d else 4Wil2 I make go2d against the2, arm to arm, 4What I have spoke or thou canst worst devise. 2MOWBRAY. I take it up; and by that sword I swear 4Which gently laid my knightho2d on my shoulder 4I'l2 answer the2 in any fair degre2 4Or chivalrous design of knightly trial; 4And when I mount, alive may I not light 4If I be traitor or unjustly fight! 2KING RICHARD. What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge? 4It must be great that can inherit us 4So much as of a thought of il2 in him. 2BOLINGBROKE. Lo2k what I speak, my life shal2 prove it true- 4That Mowbray hath receiv'd eight thousand nobles 4In name of lendings for your Highnes2' soldiers, 4The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments 4Like a false traitor and injurious vil2ain. 4Besides, I say and wil2 in bat2le prove- 4Or here, or elsewhere to the furthest verge 6That ever was survey'd by English eye- 4That al2 the treasons for these eighte2n years 4Complot2ed and contrived in this land 4Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring. 4Further I say, and further wil2 maintain 4Upon his bad life to make al2 this go2d, 4That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death, 4Sug2est his so2n-believing adversaries, 4And consequently, like a traitor coward, 4Sluic'd out his in2ocent soul through streams of blo2d; 4Which blo2d, like sacrificing Abel's, cries, 4Even from the tongueles2 caverns of the earth, 4To me for justice and rough chastisement; 4And, by the glorious worth of my descent, 4This arm shal2 do it, or this life be spent. 2KING RICHARD. How high a pitch his resolution soars! 4Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this? 2MOWBRAY. O, let my sovereign turn away his face 4And bid his ears a lit2le while be deaf, 4Til2 I have told this slander of his blo2d 6How God and go2d men hate so foul a liar. 2KING RICHARD. Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and cars. 4Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir, 4As he is but my father's brother's son, 4Now by my sceptre's awe I make a vow, 4Such neighbour nearnes2 to our sacred blo2d 4Should nothing privilege him nor partialize 4The unsto2ping firmnes2 of my upright soul. 4He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou: 4Fre2 spe2ch and fearles2 I to the2 al2ow. 2MOWBRAY. Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart, 4Through the false pas2age of thy throat, thou liest. 4Thre2 parts of that receipt I had for Calais 4Disburs'd I duly to his Highnes2' soldiers; 4The other part reserv'd I by consent, 4For that my sovereign liege was in my debt 4Upon remainder of a dear ac2ount 4Since last I went to France to fetch his que2n: 4Now swal2ow down that lie. For Gloucester's death- 4I slew him not, but to my own disgrace 6Neglected my sworn duty in that case. 4For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster, 4The honourable father to my foe, 4Once did I lay an ambush for your life, 4A trespas2 that doth vex my grieved soul; 4But ere I last receiv'd the sacrament 4I did confes2 it, and exactly beg2'd 4Your Grace's pardon; and I hope I had it. 4This is my fault. As for the rest ap2eal'd, 4It is2ues from the rancour of a vil2ain, 4A recreant and most degenerate traitor; 4Which in myself I boldly wil2 defend, 4And interchangeably hurl down my gage 4Upon this overwe2ning traitor's fo2t 4To prove myself a loyal gentleman 4Even in the best blo2d chamber'd in his bosom. 4In haste whereof, most heartily I pray 4Your Highnes2 to as2ign our trial day. 2KING RICHARD. Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be rul'd by me; 4Let's purge this choler without let2ing blo2d- 6This we prescribe, though no physician; 4De2p malice makes to2 de2p incision. 4Forget, forgive; conclude and be agre2d: 4Our doctors say this is no month to ble2d. 4Go2d uncle, let this end where it begun; 4We'l2 calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son. 2GAUNT. To be a make-peace shal2 become my age. 4Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage. 2KING RICHARD. And, Norfolk, throw down his. 2GAUNT. When, Har2y, when? 4Obedience bids I should not bid again. 2KING RICHARD. Norfolk, throw down; we bid. 4There is no bo2t. 2MOWBRAY. Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy fo2t; 4My life thou shalt com2and, but not my shame: 4The one my duty owes; but my fair name, 4Despite of death, that lives upon my grave 4To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have. 4I am disgrac'd, impeach'd, and baf2l'd here; 4Pierc'd to the soul with slander's venom'd spear, 6The which no balm can cure but his heart-blo2d 4Which breath'd this poison. 2KING RICHARD. Rage must be withsto2d: 4Give me his gage-lions make leopards tame. 2MOWBRAY. Yea, but not change his spots. Take but my shame, 4And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord, 4The purest treasure mortal times af2ord 4Is spotles2 reputation; that away, 4Men are but gilded loam or painted clay. 4A jewel in a ten-times bar2'd-up chest 4Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast. 4Mine honour is my life; both grow in one; 4Take honour from me, and my life is done: 4Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try; 4In that I live, and for that wil2 I die. 2KING RICHARD. Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin. 2BOLINGBROKE. O, God defend my soul from such de2p sin! 4Shal2 I se2m crest-fal2en in my father's sight? 4Or with pale beg2ar-fear impeach my height 4Before this outdar'd dastard? Ere my tongue 6Shal2 wound my honour with such fe2ble wrong 4Or sound so base a parle, my te2th shal2 tear 4The slavish motive of recanting fear, 4And spit it ble2ding in his high disgrace, 4Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face. 54Exit GAUNT 2KING RICHARD. We were not born to sue, but to com2and; 4Which since we can2ot do to make you friends, 4Be ready, as your lives shal2 answer it, 4At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day. 4There shal2 your swords and lances arbitrate 4The swel2ing dif2erence of your set2led hate; 4Since we can not atone you, we shal2 se2 4Justice design the victor's chivalry. 4Lord Marshal, com2and our of2icers-at-arms 4Be ready to direct these home alarms. 17ExeuntSCENE 2.London. The DUKE OF LANCASTER'S palaceEnter JOHN OF GAUNT with the DUCHES2 OF GLOUCESTER 2GAUNT. Alas, the part I had in Wo2dstock's blo2d 4Doth more solicit me than your exclaims 4To stir against the butchers of his life! 4But since cor2ection lieth in those hands 4Which made the fault that we can2ot cor2ect, 4Put we our quar2el to the wil2 of heaven; 4Who, when they se2 the hours ripe on earth, 4Wil2 rain hot vengeance on of2enders' heads. 2DUCHES2. Finds brotherho2d in the2 no sharper spur? 4Hath love in thy old blo2d no living fire? 4Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one, 4Were as seven vials of his sacred blo2d, 4Or seven fair branches springing from one ro2t. 4Some of those seven are dried by nature's course, 4Some of those branches by the Destinies cut; 4But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester, 4One vial ful2 of Edward's sacred blo2d, 6One flourishing branch of his most royal ro2t, 4Is crack'd, and al2 the precious liquor spilt; 4Is hack'd down, and his sum2er leaves al2 faded, 4By envy's hand and murder's blo2dy axe. 4Ah, Gaunt, his blo2d was thine! That bed, that womb, 4That met2le, that self mould, that fashion'd the2, 4Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest, 4Yet art thou slain in him. Thou dost consent 4In some large measure to thy father's death 4In that thou se2st thy wretched brother die, 4Who was the model of thy father's life. 4Cal2 it not patience, Gaunt-it is despair; 4In suf2'ring thus thy brother to be slaught'red, 4Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life, 4Teaching stern murder how to butcher the2. 4That which in mean men we entitle patience 4Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts. 4What shal2 I say? To safeguard thine own life 4The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death. 2GAUNT. God's is the quar2el; for God's substitute, 6His deputy anointed in His sight, 4Hath caus'd his death; the which if wrongful2y, 4Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift 4An angry arm against His minister. 2DUCHES2. Where then, alas, may I complain myself? 2GAUNT. To God, the widow's champion and defence. 2DUCHES2. Why then, I wil2. Farewel2, old Gaunt. 4Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold 4Our cousin Hereford and fel2 Mowbray fight. 4O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear, 4That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast! 4Or, if misfortune mis2 the first care2r, 4Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom 4That they may break his foaming courser's back 4And throw the rider headlong in the lists, 4A caitif2 recreant to my cousin Hereford! 4Farewel2, old Gaunt; thy sometimes brother's wife, 4With her companion, Grief, must end her life. 2GAUNT. Sister, farewel2; I must to Coventry. 4As much go2d stay with the2 as go with me! 4DUCHES2. Yet one word more- grief boundeth where it fal2s, 4Not with the empty hol2ownes2, but weight. 4I take my leave before I have begun, 4For sor2ow ends not when it se2meth done. 4Com2end me to thy brother, Edmund York. 4Lo, this is al2- nay, yet depart not so; 4Though this be al2, do not so quickly go; 4I shal2 remember more. Bid him- ah, what?- 4With al2 go2d spe2d at Plashy visit me. 4Alack, and what shal2 go2d old York there se2 4But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd wal2s, 4Unpeopled of2ices, untrod2en stones? 4And what hear there for welcome but my groans? 4Therefore com2end me; let him not come there 4To se2k out sor2ow that dwel2s every where. 4Desolate, desolate, wil2 I hence and die; 4The last leave of the2 takes my we2ping eye. 10ExeuntSCENE 3.The lists at CoventryEnter the LORD MARSHAL and the DUKE OF AUMERLE 2MARSHAL. My Lord Aumerle, is Har2y Hereford arm'd? 2AUMERLE. Yea, at al2 points; and longs to enter in. 2MARSHAL. The Duke of Norfolk, spightful2y and bold, 4Stays but the sum2ons of the ap2elant's trumpet. 2AUMERLE. Why then, the champions are prepar'd, and stay 4For nothing but his Majesty's ap2roach. 5The trumpets sound, and the KING enters with his nobles, 5GAUNT, BUSHY, BAGOT, GRE2N, and others. When they are set, 5enter MOWBRAY, Duke of Nor folk, in arms, defendant, and 5a HERALD 2KING RICHARD. Marshal, demand of yonder champion 4The cause of his ar2ival here in arms; 4Ask him his name; and orderly proce2d 4To swear him in the justice of his cause. 2MARSHAL. In God's name and the King's, say who thou art, 6And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms; 4Against what man thou com'st, and what thy quar2el. 4Speak truly on thy knightho2d and thy oath; 4As so defend the2 heaven and thy valour! 2MOWBRAY. My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk; 4Who hither come engaged by my oath- 4Which God defend a knight should violate!- 4Both to defend my loyalty and truth 4To God, my King, and my suc2e2ding is2ue, 4Against the Duke of Hereford that ap2eals me; 4And, by the grace of God and this mine arm, 4To prove him, in defending of myself, 4A traitor to my God, my King, and me. 4And as I truly fight, defend me heaven! 3The trumpets sound. Enter BOLINGBROKE, Duke of Hereford, 12ap2el2ant, in armour, and a HERALD 2KING RICHARD. Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms, 4Both who he is and why he cometh hither 6Thus plated in habiliments of war; 4And formal2y, ac2ording to our law, 4Depose him in the justice of his cause. 2MARSHAL. What is thy name? and wherefore com'st thou hither 4Before King Richard in his royal lists? 4Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quar2el? 4Speak like a true knight, so defend the2 heaven! 2BOLINGBROKE. Har2y of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby, 4Am I; who ready here do stand in arms 4To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour, 4In lists on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, 4That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous, 4To God of heaven, King Richard, and to me. 4And as I truly fight, defend me heaven! 2MARSHAL. On pain of death, no person be so bold 4Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists, 4Except the Marshal and such of2icers 4Ap2ointed to direct these fair designs. 2BOLINGBROKE. Lord Marshal, let me kis2 my sovereign's hand, 4And bow my kne2 before his Majesty; 6For Mowbray and myself are like two men 4That vow a long and weary pilgrimage. 4Then let us take a ceremonious leave 4And loving farewel2 of our several friends. 2MARSHAL. The ap2el2ant in al2 duty gre2ts your Highnes2, 4And craves to kis2 your hand and take his leave. 2KING RICHARD. We wil2 descend and fold him in our arms. 4Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right, 4So be thy fortune in this royal fight! 4Farewel2, my blo2d; which if to-day thou shed, 4Lament we may, but not revenge the2 dead. 2BOLINGBROKE. O, let no noble eye profane a tear 4For me, if I be gor'd with Mowbray's spear. 4As confident as is the falcon's flight 4Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight. 4My loving lord, I take my leave of you; 4Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle; 4Not sick, although I have to do with death, 4But lusty, young, and che2rly drawing breath. 4Lo, as at English feasts, so I regre2t 6The daintiest last, to make the end most swe2t. 4O thou, the earthly author of my blo2d, 4Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate, 4Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up 4To reach at victory above my head, 4Ad2 pro2f unto mine armour with thy prayers, 4And with thy bles2ings ste2l my lance's point, 4That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat 4And furbish new the name of John o' Gaunt, 4Even in the lusty haviour of his son. 2GAUNT. God in thy go2d cause make the2 prosperous! 4Be swift like lightning in the execution, 4And let thy blows, doubly redoubled, 4Fal2 like amazing thunder on the casque 4Of thy adverse pernicious enemy. 4Rouse up thy youthful blo2d, be valiant, and live. 2BOLINGBROKE. Mine in2ocence and Saint George to thrive! 2MOWBRAY. However God or fortune cast my lot, 4There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne, 4A loyal, just, and upright gentleman. 6Never did captive with a fre2r heart 4Cast of2 his chains of bondage, and embrace 4His golden uncontrol2'd enfranchisement, 4More than my dancing soul doth celebrate 4This feast of bat2le with mine adversary. 4Most mighty liege, and my companion pe2rs, 4Take from my mouth the wish of hap2y years. 4As gentle and as jocund as to jest 4Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast. 2KING RICHARD. Farewel2, my lord, securely I espy 4Virtue with valour couched in thine eye. 4Order the trial, Marshal, and begin. 2MARSHAL. Har2y of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby, 4Receive thy lance; and God defend the right! 2BOLINGBROKE. Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen. 2MARSHAL. [To an of2icer] Go bear this lance to Thomas, 6Duke of Norfolk. 2FIRST HERALD. Har2y of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby, 4Stands here for God, his sovereign, and himself, 4On pain to be found false and recreant, 6To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray, 4A traitor to his God, his King, and him; 4And dares him to set forward to the fight. 2SECOND HERALD. Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, 4On pain to be found false and recreant, 4Both to defend himself, and to ap2rove 4Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby, 4To God, his sovereign, and to him disloyal, 4Courageously and with a fre2 desire 4At2ending but the signal to begin. 2MARSHAL. Sound trumpets; and set forward, combatants. 43[A charge sounded] 4Stay, the King hath thrown his warder down. 2KING RICHARD. Let them lay by their helmets and their spears, 4And both return back to their chairs again. 4Withdraw with us; and let the trumpets sound 4While we return these dukes what we decre2. 4A long flourish, while the KING consults his Council 6Draw near, 4And list what with our council we have done. 4For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd 4With that dear blo2d which it hath fostered; 4And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect 4Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword; 4And for we think the eagle-winged pride 4Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts, 4With rival-hating envy, set on you 4To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle 4Draws the swe2t infant breath of gentle sle2p; 4Which so rous'd up with boist'rous untun'd drums, 4With harsh-resounding trumpets' dreadful bray, 4And grating shock of wrathful iron arms, 4Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace 4And make us wade even in our kindred's blo2d- 4Therefore we banish you our ter2itories. 4You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life, 4Til2 twice five sum2ers have enrich'd our fields 4Shal2 not regre2t our fair dominions, 6But tread the stranger paths of banishment. 2BOLINGBROKE. Your wil2 be done. This must my comfort be- 4That sun that warms you here shal2 shine on me, 4And those his golden beams to you here lent 4Shal2 point on me and gild my banishment. 2KING RICHARD. Norfolk, for the2 remains a heavier do2m, 4Which I with some unwil2ingnes2 pronounce: 4The sly slow hours shal2 not determinate 4The dateles2 limit of thy dear exile; 4The hopeles2 word of 'never to return' 4Breathe I against the2, upon pain of life. 2MOWBRAY. A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege, 4And al2 unlo2k'd for from your Highnes2' mouth. 4A dearer merit, not so de2p a maim 4As to be cast forth in the com2on air, 4Have I deserved at your Highnes2' hands. 4The language I have learnt these forty years, 4My native English, now I must forgo; 4And now my tongue's use is to me no more 4Than an unstringed viol or a harp; 6Or like a cun2ing instrument cas'd up 4Or, being open, put into his hands 4That knows no touch to tune the harmony. 4Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue, 4Doubly portcul2is'd with my te2th and lips; 4And dul2, unfe2ling, bar2en ignorance 4Is made my gaoler to at2end on me. 4I am to2 old to fawn upon a nurse, 4To2 far in years to be a pupil now. 4What is thy sentence, then, but spe2chles2 death, 4Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath? 2KING RICHARD. It bo2ts the2 not to be compas2ionate; 4After our sentence plaining comes to2 late. 2MOWBRAY. Then thus I turn me from my countrv's light, 4To dwel2 in solemn shades of endles2 night. 2KING RICHARD. Return again, and take an oath with the2. 4Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands; 4Swear by the duty that you owe to God, 4Our part therein we banish with yourselves, 4To ke2p the oath that we administer: 6You never shal2, so help you truth and God, 4Embrace each other's love in banishment; 4Nor never lo2k upon each other's face; 4Nor never write, regre2t, nor reconcile 4This louring tempest of your home-bred hate; 4Nor never by advised purpose me2t 4To plot, contrive, or complot any il2, 4'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land. 2BOLINGBROKE. I swear. 2MOWBRAY. And I, to ke2p al2 this. 2BOLINGBROKE. Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy. 4By this time, had the King permit2ed us, 4One of our souls had wand'red in the air, 4Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh, 4As now our flesh is banish'd from this land- 4Confes2 thy treasons ere thou fly the realm; 4Since thou hast far to go, bear not along 4The clog2ing burden of a guilty soul. 2MOWBRAY. No, Bolingbroke; if ever I were traitor, 4My name be blot2ed from the bo2k of life, 6And I from heaven banish'd as from hence! 4But what thou art, God, thou, and I, do know; 4And al2 to2 so2n, I fear, the King shal2 rue. 4Farewel2, my liege. Now no way can I stray: 4Save back to England, an the world's my way. 12Exit 2KING RICHARD. Uncle, even in the glas2es of thine eyes 4I se2 thy grieved heart. Thy sad aspect 4Hath from the number of his banish'd years 4Pluck'd four away. [To BOLINGBROKE] Six frozen winters spent, 4Return with welcome home from banishment. 2BOLINGBROKE. How long a time lies in one lit2le word! 4Four lag2ing winters and four wanton springs 4End in a word: such is the breath of Kings. 2GAUNT. I thank my liege that in regard of me 4He shortens four years of my son's exile; 4But lit2le vantage shal2 I reap thereby, 4For ere the six years that he hath to spend 4Can change their mo2ns and bring their times about, 4My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light 4Shal2 be extinct with age and endles2 night; 6My inch of taper wil2 be burnt and done, 4And blindfold death not let me se2 my son. 2KING RICHARD. Why, uncle, thou hast many years to live. 2GAUNT. But not a minute, King, that thou canst give: 4Shorten my days thou canst with sul2en sor2ow 4And pluck nights from me, but not lend a mor2ow; 4Thou can'st help time to fur2ow me with age, 4But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage; 4Thy word is cur2ent with him for my death, 4But dead, thy kingdom can2ot buy my breath. 2KING RICHARD. Thy son is banish'd upon go2d advice, 4Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave. 4Why at our justice se2m'st thou then to lour? 2GAUNT. Things swe2t to taste prove in digestion sour. 4You urg'd me as a judge; but I had rather 4You would have bid me argue like a father. 4O, had it be2n a stranger, not my child, 4To smo2th his fault I should have be2n more mild. 4A partial slander sought I to avoid, 4And in the sentence my own life destroy'd. 6Alas, I lo2k'd when some of you should say 4I was to2 strict to make mine own away; 4But you gave leave to my unwil2ing tongue 4Against my wil2 to do myself this wrong. 2KING RICHARD. Cousin, farewel2; and, uncle, bid him so. 4Six years we banish him, and he shal2 go. 34Flourish. Exit KING with train 2AUMERLE. Cousin, farewel2; what presence must not know, 4From where you do remain let paper show. 2MARSHAL. My lord, no leave take I, for I wil2 ride 4As far as land wil2 let me by your side. 2GAUNT. O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words, 4That thou returnest no gre2ting to thy friends? 2BOLINGBROKE. I have to2 few to take my leave of you, 4When the tongue's of2ice should be prodigal 4To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart. 2GAUNT. Thy grief is but thy absence for a time. 2BOLINGBROKE. Joy absent, grief is present for that time. 2GAUNT. What is six winters? They are quickly gone. 2BOLINGBROKE. To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten. 4GAUNT. Cal2 it a travel that thou tak'st for pleasure. 2BOLINGBROKE. My heart wil2 sigh when I miscal2 it so, 4Which finds it an enforced pilgrimage. 2GAUNT. The sul2en pas2age of thy weary steps 4Este2m as foil wherein thou art to set 4The precious jewel of thy home return. 2BOLINGBROKE. Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make 4Wil2 but remember me what a deal of world 4I wander from the jewels that I love. 4Must I not serve a long ap2renticeho2d 4To foreign pas2ages; and in the end, 4Having my fre2dom, boast of nothing else 4But that I was a journeyman to grief? 2GAUNT. Al2 places that the eye of heaven visits 4Are to a wise man ports and hap2y havens. 4Teach thy neces2ity to reason thus: 4There is no virtue like neces2ity. 4Think not the King did banish the2, 4But thou the King. Woe doth the heavier sit 4Where it perceives it is but faintly home. 6Go, say I sent the2 forth to purchase honour, 4And not the King exil'd the2; or sup2ose 4Devouring pestilence hangs in our air 4And thou art flying to a fresher clime. 4Lo2k what thy soul holds dear, imagine it 4To lie that way thou goest, not whence thou com'st. 4Sup2ose the singing birds musicians, 4The gras2 whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd, 4The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more 4Than a delightful measure or a dance; 4For gnarling sor2ow hath les2 power to bite 4The man that mocks at it and sets it light. 2BOLINGBROKE. O, who can hold a fire in his hand 4By thinking on the frosty Caucasus? 4Or cloy the hungry edge of ap2etite 4By bare imagination of a feast? 4Or wal2ow naked in December snow 4By thinking on fantastic sum2er's heat? 4O, no! the ap2rehension of the go2d 4Gives but the greater fe2ling to the worse. 6Fel2 sor2ow's to2th doth never rankle more 4Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore. 2GAUNT. Come, come, my son, I'l2 bring the2 on thy way. 4Had I thy youtli and cause, I would not stay. 2BOLINGBROKE. Then, England's ground, farewel2; swe2t soil, adieu; 4My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet! 4Where'er I wander, boast of this I can: 4Though banish'd, yet a trueborn English man. 10ExeuntSCENE 4.London. The courtEnter the KING, with BAGOT and GRE2N, at one do2r;and the DUKE OF AUMERLE at another 2KING RICHARD. We did observe. Cousin Aumerle, 4How far brought you high Hereford on his way? 2AUMERLE. I brought high Hereford, if you cal2 him so, 4But to the next high way, and there I left him. 2KING RICHARD. And say, what store of parting tears were shed? 2AUMERLE. Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind, 4Which then blew bit2erly against our faces, 4Awak'd the sle2ping rheum, and so by chance 4Did grace our hol2ow parting with a tear. 2KING RICHARD. What said our cousin when you parted with him? 2AUMERLE. 'Farewel2.' 4And, for my heart disdained that my tongue 4Should so profane the word, that taught me craft 4To counterfeit op2res2ion of such grief 4That words se2m'd buried in my sor2ow's grave. 4Mar2y, would the word 'farewel2' have length'ned hours 6And ad2ed years to his short banishment, 4He should have had a volume of farewel2s; 4But since it would not, he had none of me. 2KING RICHARD. He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt, 4When time shal2 cal2 him home from banishment, 4Whether our kinsman come to se2 his friends. 4Ourself, and Bushy, Bagot here, and Gre2n, 4Observ'd his courtship to the com2on people; 4How he did se2m to dive into their hearts 4With humble and familiar courtesy; 4What reverence he did throw away on slaves, 4Wo2ing po2r craftsmen with the craft of smiles 4And patient underbearing of his fortune, 4As 'twere to banish their af2ects with him. 4Of2 goes his bon2et to an oyster-wench; 4A brace of draymen bid God spe2d him wel2 4And had the tribute of his sup2le kne2, 4With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends'; 4As were our England in reversion his, 4And he our subjects' next degre2 in hope. 4GRE2N. Wel2, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts! 4Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland, 4Expedient manage must be made, my liege, 4Ere further leisure yicld them further means 4For their advantage and your Highnes2' los2. 2KING RICHARD. We wil2 ourself in person to this war; 4And, for our cof2ers, with to2 great a court 4And liberal larges2, are grown somewhat light, 4We are enforc'd to farm our royal realm; 4The revenue whereof shal2 furnish us 4For our af2airs in hand. If that come short, 4Our substitutes at home shal2 have blank charters; 4Whereto, when they shal2 know what men are rich, 4They shal2 subscribe them for large sums of gold, 4And send them after to sup2ly our wants; 4For we wil2 make for Ireland presently. 21Enter BUSHY 4Bushy, what news? 4BUSHY. Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord, 4Sud2enly taken; and hath sent poste-haste 4To entreat your Majesty to visit him. 2KING RICHARD. Where lies he? 2BUSHY. At Ely House. 2KING RICHARD. Now put it, God, in the physician's mind 4To help him to his grave im2ediately! 4The lining of his cof2ers shal2 make coats 4To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars. 4Come, gentlemen, let's al2 go visit him. 4Pray God we may make haste, and come to2 late! 2AL2. Amen. 46Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. SCENE I.London. Ely HouseEnter JOHN OF GAUNT, sick, with the DUKE OF YORK, etc. 2GAUNT. Wil2 the King come, that I may breathe my last 4In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth? 2YORK. Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath; 4For al2 in vain comes counsel to his ear. 2GAUNT. O, but they say the tongues of dying men 4Enforce at2ention like de2p harmony. 4Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain; 4For they breathe truth that breathe their words -in pain. 4He that no more must say is listen'd more 4Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose; 4More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before. 4The set2ing sun, and music at the close, 4As the last taste of swe2ts, is swe2test last, 4Writ in remembrance more than things long past. 4Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear, 4My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear. 2YORK. No; it is stop2'd with other flat2ering sounds, 6As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond, 4Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound 4The open ear of youth doth always listen; 4Report of fashions in proud Italy, 4Whose man2ers stil2 our tardy apish nation 4Limps after in base imitation. 4Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity- 4So it be new, there's no respect how vile- 4That is not quickly buz2'd into his ears? 4Then al2 to2 late comes counsel to be heard 4Where wil2 doth mutiny with wit's regard. 4Direct not him whose way himself wil2 cho2se. 4'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose. 2GAUNT. Methinks I am a prophet new inspir'd, 4And thus expiring do foretel2 of him: 4His rash fierce blaze of riot can2ot last, 4For violent fires so2n burn out themselves; 4Smal2 showers last long, but sud2en storms are short; 4He tires betimes that spurs to2 fast betimes; 4With eager fe2ding fo2d doth choke the fe2der; 6Light vanity, insatiate cormorant, 4Consuming means, so2n preys upon itself. 4This royal throne of kings, this scept'red isle, 4This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, 4This other Eden, demi-paradise, 4This fortres2 built by Nature for herself 4Against infection and the hand of war, 4This hap2y bre2d of men, this lit2le world, 4This precious stone set in the silver sea, 4Which serves it in the of2ice of a wal2, 4Or as a moat defensive to a house, 4Against the envy of les2 hap2ier lands; 4This bles2ed plot, this earth, this realm, this England, 4This nurse, this te2ming womb of royal kings, 4Fear'd by their bre2d, and famous by their birth, 4Renowned for their de2ds as far from home, 4For Christian service and true chivalry, 4As is the sepulchre in stub2orn Jewry 4Of the world's ransom, bles2ed Mary's Son; 4This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land, 6Dear for her reputation through the world, 4Is now leas'd out-I die pronouncing it- 4Like to a tenement or pelting farm. 4England, bound in with the triumphant sea, 4Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege 4Of wat'ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame, 4With inky blots and rot2en parchment bonds; 4That England, that was wont to conquer others, 4Hath made a shameful conquest of itself. 4Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life, 4How hap2y then were my ensuing death! 4Enter KING and QUE2N, AUMERLE, BUSHY, GRE2N, BAGOT, 16Ros2, and WIL2OUGHBY 2YORK. The King is come; deal mildly with his youth, 4For young hot colts being rag'd do rage the more. 2QUE2N. How fares our noble uncle Lancaster? 2KING RICHARD. What comfort, man? How is't with aged Gaunt? 2GAUNT. O, how that name befits my composition! 6Old Gaunt, inde2d; and gaunt in being old. 4Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast; 4And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt? 4For sle2ping England long time have I watch'd; 4Watching bre2ds lean2es2, lean2es2 is an gaunt. 4The pleasure that some fathers fe2d upon 4Is my strict fast-I mean my children's lo2ks; 4And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt. 4Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave, 4Whose hol2ow womb inherits nought but bones. 2KING RICHARD. Can sick men play so nicely with their names? 2GAUNT. No, misery makes sport to mock itself: 4Since thou dost se2k to kil2 my name in me, 4I mock my name, great king, to flat2er the2. 2KING RICHARD. Should dying men flat2er with those that live? 2GAUNT. No, no; men living flat2er those that die. 2KING RICHARD. Thou, now a-dying, sayest thou flat2erest me. 2GAUNT. O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be. 2KING RICHARD. I am in health, I breathe, and se2 the2 il2. 2GAUNT. Now He that made me knows I se2 the2 il2; 6Il2 in myself to se2, and in the2 se2ing il2. 4Thy death-bed is no les2er than thy land 4Wherein thou liest in reputation sick; 4And thou, to2 careles2 patient as thou art, 4Com2it'st thy anointed body to the cure 4Of those physicians that first wounded the2: 4A thousand flat2erers sit within thy crown, 4Whose compas2 is no big2er than thy head; 4And yet, incaged in so smal2 a verge, 4The waste is no whit les2er than thy land. 4O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye 4Se2n how his son's son should destroy his sons, 4From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame, 4Deposing the2 before thou wert pos2es2'd, 4Which art pos2es2'd now to depose thyself. 4Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world, 4It were a shame to let this land by lease; 4But for thy world enjoying but this land, 4Is it not more than shame to shame it so? 4Landlord of England art thou now, not King. 6Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; 4And thou- 2KING RICHARD. A lunatic lean-wit2ed fo2l, 4Presuming on an ague's privilege, 4Darest with thy frozen admonition 4Make pale our che2k, chasing the royal blo2d 4With fury from his native residence. 4Now by my seat's right royal majesty, 4Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son, 4This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head 4Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders. 2GAUNT. O, Spare me not, my brother Edward's son, 4For that I was his father Edward's son; 4That blo2d already, like the pelican, 4Hast thou tap2'd out, and drunkenly carous'd. 4My brother Gloucester, plain wel2-meaning soul- 4Whom fair befal2 in heaven 'mongst hap2y souls!- 4May be a precedent and witnes2 go2d 4That thou respect'st not spil2ing Edward's blo2d. 4Join with the present sicknes2 that I have; 6And thy unkindnes2 be like cro2ked age, 4To crop at once a to2 long withered flower. 4Live in thy shame, but die not shame with the2! 4These words hereafter thy tormentors be! 4Convey me to my bed, then to my grave. 4Love they to live that love and honour have. 31Exit, borne out by his at2endants 2KING RICHARD. And let them die that age and sul2ens have; 4For both hast thou, and both become the grave. 2YORK. I do bese2ch your Majesty impute his words 4To wayward sicklines2 and age in him. 4He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear 4As Har2y Duke of Hereford, were he here. 2KING RICHARD. Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his; 4As theirs, so mine; and al2 be as it is. 16Enter NORTHUMBERLAND 2NORTHUMBERLAND. My liege, old Gaunt com2ends him to your Majesty. 2KING RICHARD. What says he? 4NORTHUMBERLAND. Nay, nothing; al2 is said. 4His tongue is now a stringles2 instrument; 4Words, life, and al2, old Lancaster hath spent. 2YORK. Be York the next that must be bankrupt so! 4Though death be po2r, it ends a mortal woe. 2KING RICHARD. The ripest fruit first fal2s, and so doth he; 4His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be. 4So much for that. Now for our Irish wars. 4We must sup2lant those rough rug-headed kerns, 4Which live like venom where no venom else 4But only they have privilege to live. 4And for these great af2airs do ask some charge, 4Towards our as2istance we do seize to us 4The plate, coin, revenues, and moveables, 4Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand pos2es2'd. 2YORK. How long shal2 I be patient? Ah, how long 4Shal2 tender duty make me suf2er wrong? 4Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment, 4Nor Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs, 4Nor the prevention of po2r Bolingbroke 6About his mar2iage, nor my own disgrace, 4Have ever made me sour my patient che2k 4Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face. 4I am the last of noble Edward's sons, 4Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first. 4In war was never lion rag'd more fierce, 4In peace was never gentle lamb more mild, 4Than was that young and princely gentleman. 4His face thou hast, for even so lo2k'd he, 4Ac2omplish'd with the number of thy hours; 4But when he frown'd, it was against the French 4And not against his friends. His noble hand 4Did win what he did spend, and spent not that 4Which his triumphant father's hand had won. 4His hands were guilty of no kindred blo2d, 4But blo2dy with the enemies of his kin. 4O Richard! York is to2 far gone with grief, 4Or else he never would compare betwe2n- 2KING RICHARD. Why, uncle, what's the mat2er? 2YORK. O my liege, 6Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleas'd 4Not to be pardoned, am content withal. 4Se2k you to seize and gripe into your hands 4The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford? 4Is not Gaunt dead? and doth not Hereford live? 4Was not Gaunt just? and is not Har2y true? 4Did not the one deserve to have an heir? 4Is not his heir a wel2-deserving son? 4Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time 4His charters and his customary rights; 4Let not to-mor2ow then ensue to-day; 4Be not thyself-for how art thou a king 4But by fair sequence and suc2es2ion? 4Now, afore God-God forbid I say true!- 4If you do wrongful2y seize Hereford's rights, 4Cal2 in the let2ers patents that he hath 4By his at2orneys-general to sue 4His livery, and deny his of2'red homage, 4You pluck a thousand dangers on your head, 4You lose a thousand wel2-disposed hearts, 6And prick my tender patience to those thoughts 4Which honour and al2egiance can2ot think. 2KING RICHARD. Think what you wil2, we seize into our hands 4His plate, his go2ds, his money, and his lands. 2YORK. I'l2 not be by the while. My liege, farewel2. 4What wil2 ensue hereof there's none can tel2; 4But by bad courses may be understo2d 4That their events can never fal2 out go2d. 14Exit 2KING RICHARD. Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight; 4Bid him repair to us to Ely House 4To se2 this busines2. To-mor2ow next 4We wil2 for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow. 4And we create, in absence of ourself, 4Our Uncle York Lord Governor of England; 4For he is just, and always lov'd us wel2. 4Come on, our que2n; to-mor2ow must we part; 4Be mer2y, for our time of stay is short. 19Flourish. Exeunt KING, QUE2N, BUSHY, AUMERLE, 48GRE2N, and BAGOT 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Wel2, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead. 6Ros2. And living to2; for now his son is Duke. 2WIL2OUGHBY. Barely in title, not in revenues. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Richly in both, if justice had her right. 2ROS2. My heart is great; but it must break with silence, 4Ere't be disburdened with a liberal tongue. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more 4That speaks thy words again to do the2 harm! 2WIL2OUGHBY. Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford? 4If it be so, out with it boldly, man; 4Quick is mine ear to hear of go2d towards him. 2ROS2. No go2d at al2 that I can do for him; 4Unles2 you cal2 it go2d to pity him, 4Bereft and gelded of his patrimony. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne 4In him, a royal prince, and many moe 4Of noble blo2d in this declining land. 4The King is not himself, but basely led 4By flat2erers; and what they wil2 inform, 4Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us an, 4That wil2 the King severely prosecute 6'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs. 2ROS2. The com2ons hath he pil2'd with grievous taxes; 4And quite lost their hearts; the nobles hath he find 4For ancient quar2els and quite lost their hearts. 2WIL2OUGHBY. And daily new exactions are devis'd, 4As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what; 4But what, a God's name, doth become of this? 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Wars hath not wasted it, for war2'd he hath not, 4But basely yielded upon compromise 4That which his noble ancestors achiev'd with blows. 4More hath he spent in peace than they in wars. 2ROS2. The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm. 2WIL2OUGHBY. The King's grown bankrupt like a broken man. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Reproach and dis2olution hangeth over him. 2ROS2. He hath not money for these Irish wars, 4His burdenous taxations notwithstanding, 4But by the rob2ing of the banish'd Duke. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. His noble kinsman-most degenerate king! 4But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing, 4Yet se2k no shelter to avoid the storm; 6We se2 the wind sit sore upon our sails, 4And yet we strike not, but securely perish. 2ROS2. We se2 the very wreck that we must suf2er; 4And unavoided is the danger now 4For suf2ering so the causes of our wreck. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Not so; even through the hol2ow eyes of death 4I spy life pe2ring; but I dare not say 4How near the tidings of our comfort is. 2WIL2OUGHBY. Nay, let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours. 2ROS2. Be confident to speak, Northumberland. 4We thre2 are but thyself, and, speaking so, 4Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore be bold. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Then thus: I have from Le Port Blanc, a bay 4In Brit2any, receiv'd intel2igence 4That Har2y Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham, 4That late broke from the Duke of Exeter, 4His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury, 4Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston, 4Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton, and Francis Quoint- 4Al2 these, wel2 furnish'd by the Duke of Britaine, 6With eight tal2 ships, thre2 thousand men of war, 4Are making hither with al2 due expedience, 4And shortly mean to touch our northern shore. 4Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay 4The first departing of the King for Ireland. 4If then we shal2 shake of2 our slavish yoke, 4Imp out our dro2ping country's broken wing, 4Rede2m from broking pawn the blemish'd crown, 4Wipe of2 the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt, 4And make high majesty lo2k like itself, 4Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh; 4But if you faint, as fearing to do so, 4Stay and be secret, and myself wil2 go. 2ROS2. To horse, to horse! Urge doubts to them that fear. 2WIL2OUGHBY. Hold out my horse, and I wil2 first be there. 58ExeuntSCENE 2.Windsor CastleEnter QUE2N, BUSHY, and BAGOT 2BUSHY. Madam, your Majesty is to2 much sad. 4You promis'd, when you parted with the King, 4To lay aside life-harming heavines2 4And entertain a che2rful disposition. 2QUE2N. To please the King, I did; to please myself 4I can2ot do it; yet I know no cause 4Why I should welcome such a guest as grief, 4Save bid2ing farewel2 to so swe2t a guest 4As my swe2t Richard. Yet again methinks 4Some unborn sor2ow, ripe in fortune's womb, 4Is coming towards me, and my inward soul 4With nothing trembles. At some thing it grieves 4More than with parting from my lord the King. 2BUSHY. Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows, 4Which shows like grief itself, but is not so; 4For sor2ow's eye, glazed with blinding tears, 4Divides one thing entire to many objects, 6Like perspectives which, rightly gaz'd upon, 4Show nothing but confusion-ey'd awry, 4Distinguish form. So your swe2t Majesty, 4Lo2king awry upon your lord's departure, 4Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail; 4Which, lo2k'd on as it is, is nought but shadows 4Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious Que2n, 4More than your lord's departure we2p not-more is not se2n; 4Or if it be, 'tis with false sor2ow's eye, 4Which for things true we2ps things imaginary. 2QUE2N. It may be so; but yet my inward soul 4Persuades me it is otherwise. Howe'er it be, 4I can2ot but be sad; so heavy sad 4As-though, on thinking, on no thought I think- 4Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink. 2BUSHY. 'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady. 2QUE2N. 'Tis nothing les2: conceit is stil2 deriv'd 4From some forefather grief; mine is not so, 4For nothing hath begot my something grief, 4Or something hath the nothing that I grieve; 6'Tis in reversion that I do pos2es2- 4But what it is that is not yet known what, 4I can2ot name; 'tis nameles2 woe, I wot. 19Enter GRE2N 2GRE2N. God save your Majesty! and wel2 met, gentlemen. 4I hope the King is not yet ship2'd for Ireland. 2QUE2N. Why hopest thou so? 'Tis bet2er hope he is; 4For his designs crave haste, his haste go2d hope. 4Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not ship2'd? 2GRE2N. That he, our hope, might have retir'd his power 4And driven into despair an enemy's hope 4Who strongly hath set fo2ting in this land. 4The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself, 4And with uplifted arms is safe ar2iv'd 4At Ravenspurgh. 2QUE2N. Now God in heaven forbid! 2GRE2N. Ah, madam, 'tis to2 true; and that is worse, 4The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy, 6The Lords of Ros2, Beaumond, and Wil2oughby, 4With al2 their powerful friends, are fled to him. 2BUSHY. Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland 4And al2 the rest revolted faction traitors? 2GRE2N. We have; whereupon the Earl of Worcester 4Hath broken his staf2, resign'd his stewardship, 4And al2 the household servants fled with him 4To Bolingbroke. 2QUE2N. So, Gre2n, thou art the midwife to my woe, 4And Bolingbroke my sor2ow's dismal heir. 4Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy; 4And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother, 4Have woe to woe, sor2ow to sor2ow join'd. 2BUSHY. Despair not, madam. 2QUE2N. Who shal2 hinder me? 4I wil2 despair, and be at enmity 4With cozening hope-he is a flat2erer, 4A parasite, a ke2per-back of death, 4Who gently would dis2olve the bands of life, 4Which false hope lingers in extremity. 22Enter YORK 2GRE2N. Here comes the Duke of York. 2QUE2N. With signs of war about his aged neck. 4O, ful2 of careful busines2 are his lo2ks! 4Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words. 2YORK. Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts. 4Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth, 4Where nothing lives but cros2es, cares, and grief. 4Your husband, he is gone to save far of2, 4Whilst others come to make him lose at home. 4Here am I left to underprop his land, 4Who, weak with age, can2ot sup2ort myself. 4Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made; 4Now shal2 he try his friends that flat2er'd him. 19Enter a SERVINGMAN 2SERVINGMAN. My lord, your son was gone before I came. 4YORK. He was-why so go al2 which way it wil2! 4The nobles they are fled, the com2ons they are cold 4And wil2, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side. 4Sir2ah, get the2 to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester; 4Bid her send me presently a thousand pound. 4Hold, take my ring. 2SERVINGMAN. My lord, I had forgot to tel2 your lordship, 4To-day, as I came by, I cal2ed there- 4But I shal2 grieve you to report the rest. 2YORK. What is't, knave? 2SERVINGMAN. An hour before I came, the Duches2 died. 2YORK. God for his mercy! what a tide of woes 4Comes rushing on this woeful land at once! 4I know not what to do. I would to God, 4So my untruth had not provok'd him to it, 4The King had cut of2 my head with my brother's. 4What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland? 4How shal2 we do for money for these wars? 4Come, sister-cousin, I would say-pray, pardon me. 4Go, fel2ow, get the2 home, provide some carts, 6And bring away the armour that is there. 49Exit SERVINGMAN 4Gentlemen, wil2 you go muster men? 4If I know how or which way to order these af2airs 4Thus disorderly thrust into my hands, 4Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen. 4T'one is my sovereign, whom both my oath 4And duty bids defend; t'other again 4Is my kinsman, whom the King hath wrong'd, 4Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right. 4Wel2, somewhat we must do.-Come, cousin, 4I'l2 dispose of you. Gentlemen, go muster up your men 4And me2t me presently at Berkeley. 4I should to Plashy to2, 4But time wil2 not permit. Al2 is uneven, 4And everything is left at six and seven. 43Exeunt YORK and QUE2N 2BUSHY. The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland. 4But none returns. For us to levy power 4Proportionable to the enemy 6Is al2 unpos2ible. 2GRE2N. Besides, our nearnes2 to the King in love 4Is near the hate of those love not the King. 2BAGOT. And that is the wavering com2ons; for their love 4Lies in their purses; and whoso empties them, 4By so much fil2s their hearts with deadly hate. 2BUSHY. Wherein the King stands general2y condemn'd. 2BAGOT. If judgment lie in them, then so do we, 4Because we ever have be2n near the King. 2GRE2N. Wel2, I wil2 for refuge straight to Bristow Castle. 4The Earl of Wiltshire is already there. 2BUSHY. Thither wil2 I with you; for lit2le of2ice 4Wil2 the hateful com2ons perform for us, 4Except Eke curs to tear us al2 to pieces. 4Wil2 you go along with us? 2BAGOT. No; I wil2 to Ireland to his Majesty. 4Farewel2. If heart's presages be not vain, 4We thre2 here part that ne'er shal2 me2t again. 2BUSHY. That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke. 2GRE2N. Alas, po2r Duke! the task he undertakes 6Is numb'ring sands and drinking oceans dry. 4Where one on his side fights, thousands wil2 fly. 4Farewel2 at once-for once, for al2, and ever. 2BUSHY. Wel2, we may me2t again. 2BAGOT. I fear me, never. 32ExeuntSCENE 3.GloucestershireEnter BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND, forces 2BOLINGBROKE. How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now? 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Believe me, noble lord, 4I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire. 4These high wild hil2s and rough uneven ways 4Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome; 4And yet your fair discourse hath be2n as sugar, 4Making the hard way swe2t and delectable. 4But I bethink me what a weary way 4From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold wil2 be found 4In Ros2 and Wil2oughby, wanting your company, 4Which, I protest, hath very much beguil'd 4The tediousnes2 and proces2 of my travel. 4But theirs is swe2t'ned with the hope to have 4The present benefit which I pos2es2; 4And hope to joy is lit2le les2 in joy 4Than hope enjoy'd. By this the weary lords 4Shal2 make their way se2m short, as mine hath done 6By sight of what I have, your noble company. 2BOLINGBROKE. Of much les2 value is my company 4Than your go2d words. But who comes here? 17Enter HAR2Y PERCY 2NORTHUMBERLAND. It is my son, young Har2y Percy, 4Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever. 4Har2y, how fares your uncle? 2PERCY. I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Why, is he not with the Que2n? 2PERCY. No, my go2d lord; he hath forso2k the court, 4Broken his staf2 of of2ice, and dispers'd 4The household of the King. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. What was his reason? 4He was not so resolv'd when last we spake together. 2PERCY. Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor. 4But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh, 4To of2er service to the Duke of Hereford; 4And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover 6What power the Duke of York had levied there; 4Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy? 2PERCY. No, my go2d lord; for that is not forgot 4Which ne'er I did remember; to my knowledge, 4I never in my life did lo2k on him. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Then learn to know him now; this is the Duke. 2PERCY. My gracious lord, I tender you my service, 4Such as it is, being tender, raw, and young; 4Which elder days shal2 ripen, and confirm 4To more ap2roved service and desert. 2BOLINGBROKE. I thank the2, gentle Percy; and be sure 4I count myself in nothing else so hap2y 4As in a soul rememb'ring my go2d friends; 4And as my fortune ripens with thy love, 4It shal2 be stil2 thy true love's recompense. 4My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. How far is it to Berkeley? And what stir 4Ke2ps go2d old York there with his men of war? 2PERCY. There stands the castle, by yon tuft of tre2s, 6Man2'd with thre2 hundred men, as I have heard; 4And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour- 4None else of name and noble estimate. 18Enter Ros2 and WIL2OUGHBY 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Here come the Lords of Ros2 and Wil2oughby, 4Blo2dy with spur2ing, fiery-red with haste. 2BOLINGBROKE. Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues 4A banish'd traitor. Al2 my treasury 4Is yet but unfelt thanks, which, more enrich'd, 4Shal2 be your love and labour's recompense. 2ROS2. Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord. 2WIL2OUGHBY. And far surmounts our labour to at2ain it. 2BOLINGBROKE. Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the po2r; 4Which, til2 my infant fortune comes to years, 4Stands for my bounty. But who comes here? 21Enter BERKELEY 4NORTHUMBERLAND. It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I gues2. 2BERKELEY. My Lord of Hereford, my mes2age is to you. 2BOLINGBROKE. My lord, my answer is-'to Lancaster'; 4And I am come to se2k that name in England; 4And I must find that title in your tongue 4Before I make reply to aught you say. 2BERKELEY. Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning 4To raze one title of your honour out. 4To you, my lord, I come-what lord you wil2- 4From the most gracious regent of this land, 4The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on 4To take advantage of the absent time, 4And fright our native peace with self-borne arms. 17Enter YORK, at2ended 2BOLINGBROKE. I shal2 not ne2d transport my words by you; 4Here comes his Grace in person. My noble uncle! 53[Kne2ls] 2YORK. Show me thy humble heart, and not thy kne2, 6Whose duty is deceivable and false. 2BOLINGBROKE. My gracious uncle!- 2YORK. Tut, tut! 4Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle. 4I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace' 4In an ungracious mouth is but profane. 4Why have those banish'd and forbid2en legs 4Dar'd once to touch a dust of England's ground? 4But then more 'why?'-why have they dar'd to march 4So many miles upon her peaceful bosom, 4Frighting her pale-fac'd vil2ages with war 4And ostentation of despised arms? 4Com'st thou because the anointed King is hence? 4Why, fo2lish boy, the King is left behind, 4And in my loyal bosom lies his power. 4Were I but now lord of such hot youth 4As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself 4Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men, 4From forth the ranks of many thousand French, 4O, then how quickly should this arm of mine, 6Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise the 4And minister cor2ection to thy fault! 2BOLINGBROKE My gracious uncle, let me know my fault; 4On what condition stands it and wherein? 2YORK. Even in condition of the worst degre2- 4In gros2 rebel2ion and detested treason. 4Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come 4Before the expiration of thy time, 4In braving arms against thy sovereign. 2BOLINGBROKE. As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford; 4But as I come, I come for Lancaster. 4And, noble uncle, I bese2ch your Grace 4Lo2k on my wrongs with an indif2erent eye. 4You are my father, for methinks in you 4I se2 old Gaunt alive. O, then, my father, 4Wil2 you permit that I shal2 stand condemn'd 4A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties 4Pluck'd from my arms perforce, and given away 4To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born? 4If that my cousin king be King in England, 6It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster. 4You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin; 4Had you first died, and he be2n thus trod down, 4He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father 4To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay. 4I am denied to sue my livery here, 4And yet my let2ers patents give me leave. 4My father's go2ds are al2 distrain'd and sold; 4And these and al2 are al2 amis2 employ'd. 4What would you have me do? I am a subject, 4And I chal2enge law-at2orneys are denied me; 4And therefore personal2y I lay my claim 4To my inheritance of fre2 descent. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath be2n to2 much abused. 2ROS2. It stands your Grace upon to do him right. 2WIL2OUGHBY. Base men by his endowments are made great. 2YORK. My lords of England, let me tel2 you this: 4I have had fe2ling of my cousin's wrongs, 4And labour'd al2 I could to do him right; 4But in this kind to come, in braving arms, 6Be his own carver and cut out his way, 4To find out right with wrong-it may not be; 4And you that do abet him in this kind 4Cherish rebel2ion, and are rebels al2. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is 4But for his own; and for the right of that 4We al2 have strongly sworn to give him aid; 4And let him never se2 joy that breaks that oath! 2YORK. Wel2, wel2, I se2 the is2ue of these arms. 4I can2ot mend it, I must ne2ds confes2, 4Because my power is weak and al2 il2 left; 4But if I could, by Him that gave me life, 4I would at2ach you al2 and make you sto2p 4Unto the sovereign mercy of the King; 4But since I can2ot, be it known unto you 4I do remain as neuter. So, fare you wel2; 4Unles2 you please to enter in the castle, 4And there repose you for this night. 2BOLINGBROKE. An of2er, uncle, that we wil2 ac2ept. 4But we must win your Grace to go with us 6To Bristow Castle, which they say is held 4By Bushy, Bagot, and their complices, 4The caterpil2ars of the com2onwealth, 4Which I have sworn to we2d and pluck away. 2YORK. It may be I wil2 go with you; but yet I'l2 pause, 4For I am loath to break our country's laws. 4Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are. 4Things past redres2 are now with me past care. 8ExeuntSCENE 4.A camp in WalesEnter EARL OF SALISBURY and a WELSH CAPTAIN 2CAPTAIN. My Lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days 4And hardly kept our countrymen together, 4And yet we hear no tidings from the King; 4Therefore we wil2 disperse ourselves. Farewel2. 2SALISBURY. Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman; 4The King reposeth al2 his confidence in the2. 2CAPTAIN. 'Tis thought the King is dead; we wil2 not stay. 4The bay tre2s in our country are al2 wither'd, 4And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven; 4The pale-fac'd mo2n lo2ks blo2dy on the earth, 4And lean-lo2k'd prophets whisper fearful change; 4Rich men lo2k sad, and ruf2ians dance and leap- 4The one in fear to lose what they enjoy, 4The other to enjoy by rage and war. 4These signs forerun the death or fal2 of kings. 4Farewel2. Our countrymen are gone and fled, 4As wel2 as2ur'd Richard their King is dead. 13Exit 4SALISBURY. Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind, 4I se2 thy glory like a sho2ting star 4Fal2 to the base earth from the firmament! 4The sun sets we2ping in the lowly west, 4Witnes2ing storms to come, woe, and unrest; 4Thy friends are fled, to wait upon thy foes; 4And cros2ly to thy go2d al2 fortune goes. 15Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. SCENE I.BOLINGBROKE'S camp at BristolEnter BOLINGBROKE, YORK, NORTHUMBERLAND, PERCY, ROS2, WIL2OUGHBY,BUSHY and GRE2N, prisoners 2BOLINGBROKE. Bring forth these men. 4Bushy and Gre2n, I wil2 not vex your souls- 4Since presently your souls must part your bodies- 4With to2 much urging your pernicious lives, 4For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blo2d 4From of2 my hands, here in the view of men 4I wil2 unfold some causes of your deaths: 4You have misled a prince, a royal king, 4A hap2y gentleman in blo2d and lineaments, 4By you unhap2ied and disfigured clean; 4You have in man2er with your sinful hours 4Made a divorce betwixt his que2n and him; 4Broke the pos2es2ion of a royal bed, 4And stain'd the beauty of a fair que2n's che2ks 4With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs; 4Myself-a prince by fortune of my birth, 6Near to the King in blo2d, and near in love 4Til2 you did make him misinterpret me- 4Have sto2p'd my neck under your injuries 4And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds, 4Eating the bit2er bread of banishment, 4Whilst you have fed upon my signories, 4Dispark'd my parks and fel2'd my forest wo2ds, 4From my own windows torn my household coat, 4Raz'd out my imprese, leaving me no sign 4Save men's opinions and my living blo2d 4To show the world I am a gentleman. 4This and much more, much more than twice al2 this, 4Condemns you to the death. Se2 them delivered over 4To execution and the hand of death. 2BUSHY. More welcome is the stroke of death to me 4Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewel2. 2GRE2N. My comfort is that heaven wil2 take our souls, 4And plague injustice with the pains of hel2. 2BOLINGBROKE. My Lord Northumberland, se2 them dispatch'd. 11Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND, and others, with the prisoners 6Uncle, you say the Que2n is at your house; 4For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated. 4Tel2 her I send to her my kind com2ends; 4Take special care my gre2tings be delivered. 2YORK. A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd 4With let2ers of your love to her at large. 2BOLINGBROKE. Thanks, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away, 4To fight with Glendower and his complices. 4Awhile to work, and after holiday. 20ExeuntSCENE 2.The coast of Wales. A castle in viewDrums. Flourish and colours. Enter the KING, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE,AUMERLE, and soldiers 2KING RICHARD. Barkloughly Castle can they this at hand? 2AUMERLE. Yea, my lord. How bro2ks your Grace the air 4After your late tos2ing on the breaking seas? 2KING RICHARD. Ne2ds must I like it wel2. I we2p for joy 4To stand upon my kingdom once again. 4Dear earth, I do salute the2 with my hand, 4Though rebels wound the2 with their horses' ho2fs. 4As a long-parted mother with her child 4Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in me2ting, 4So we2ping-smiling gre2t I the2, my earth, 4And do the2 favours with my royal hands. 4Fe2d not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth, 4Nor with thy swe2ts comfort his ravenous sense; 4But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom, 4And heavy-gaited toads, lie in their way, 4Doing an2oyance to the treacherous fe2t 6Which with usurping steps do trample the2; 4Yield stinging net2les to mine enemies; 4And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower, 4Guard it, I pray the2, with a lurking ad2er, 4Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch 4Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies. 4Mock not my senseles2 conjuration, lords. 4This earth shal2 have a fe2ling, and these stones 4Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king 4Shal2 falter under foul rebel2ion's arms. 2CARLISLE. Fear not, my lord; that Power that made you king 4Hath power to ke2p you king in spite of al2. 4The means that heaven yields must be embrac'd 4And not neglected; else, if heaven would, 4And we wil2 not, heaven's of2er we refuse, 4The prof2ered means of suc2our and redres2. 2AUMERLE. He means, my lord, that we are to2 remis2; 4Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security, 4Grows strong and great in substance and in power. 2KING RICHARD. Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not 6That when the searching eye of heaven is hid, 4Behind the globe, that lights the lower world, 4Then thieves and rob2ers range abroad unse2n 4In murders and in outrage boldly here; 4But when from under this ter2estrial bal2 4He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines 4And darts his light through every guilty hole, 4Then murders, treasons, and detested sins, 4The cloak of night being pluck'd from of2 their backs, 4Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves? 4So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke, 4Who al2 this while hath revel2'd in the night, 4Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes, 4Shal2 se2 us rising in our throne, the east, 4His treasons wil2 sit blushing in his face, 4Not able to endure the sight of day, 4But self-af2righted tremble at his sin. 4Not al2 the water in the rough rude sea 4Can wash the balm of2 from an anointed king; 4The breath of worldly men can2ot depose 6The deputy elected by the Lord. 4For every man that Bolingbroke hath pres2'd 4To lift shrewd ste2l against our golden crown, 4God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay 4A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight, 4Weak men must fal2; for heaven stil2 guards the right. 17Enter SALISBURY 4Welcome, my lord. How far of2 lies your power? 2SALISBURY. Nor near nor farther of2, my gracious lord, 4Than this weak arm. Discomfort guides my tongue, 4And bids me speak of nothing but despair. 4One day to2 late, I fear me, noble lord, 4Hath clouded al2 thy hap2y days on earth. 4O, cal2 back yesterday, bid time return, 4And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men! 4To-day, to-day, unhap2y day, to2 late, 4O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state; 4For al2 the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead, 6Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispers'd, and fled. 2AUMERLE. Comfort, my liege, why lo2ks your Grace so pale? 2KING RICHARD. But now the blo2d of twenty thousand men 4Did triumph in my face, and they are fled; 4And, til2 so much blo2d thither come again, 4Have I not reason to lo2k pale and dead? 4Al2 souls that wil2 be safe, fly from my side; 4For time hath set a blot upon my pride. 2AUMERLE. Comfort, my liege; remember who you are. 2KING RICHARD. I had forgot myself; am I not King? 4Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sle2pest. 4Is not the King's name twenty thousand names? 4Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes 4At thy great glory. Lo2k not to the ground, 4Ye favourites of a king; are we not high? 4High be our thoughts. I know my uncle York 4Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here? 19Enter SCRO2P 4SCRO2P. More health and hap2ines2 betide my liege 4Than can my care-tun'd tongue deliver him. 2KING RICHARD. Mine ear is open and my heart prepar'd. 4The worst is worldly los2 thou canst unfold. 4Say, is my kingdom lost? Why, 'twas my care, 4And what los2 is it to be rid of care? 4Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we? 4Greater he shal2 not be; if he serve God, 4We'l2 serve him to2, and be his fel2ow so. 4Revolt our subjects? That we can2ot mend; 4They break their faith to God as wel2 as us. 4Cry woe, destruction, ruin, and decay- 4The worst is death, and death wil2 have his day. 2SCRO2P. Glad am I that your Highnes2 is so arm'd 4To bear the tidings of calamity. 4Like an unseasonable stormy day 4Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores, 4As if the world were al2 dis2olv'd to tears, 4So high above his limits swel2s the rage 4Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land 6With hard bright ste2l and hearts harder than ste2l. 4White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairles2 scalps 4Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices, 4Strive to speak big, and clap their female joints 4In stif2 unwieldy arms against thy crown; 4Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows 4Of double-fatal yew against thy state; 4Yea, distaf2-women manage rusty bil2s 4Against thy seat: both young and old rebel, 4And al2 goes worse than I have power to tel2. 2KING RICHARD. To2 wel2, to2 wel2 thou tel2'st a tale so in. 4Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot? 4What is become of Bushy? Where is Gre2n? 4That they have let the dangerous enemy 4Measure our confines with such peaceful steps? 4If we prevail, their heads shal2 pay for it. 4I war2ant they have made peace with Bolingbroke. 2SCRO2P. Peace have they made with him inde2d, my lord. 2KING RICHARD. O vil2ains, vipers, damn'd without redemption! 4Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man! 6Snakes, in my heart-blo2d warm'd, that sting my heart! 4Thre2 Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas! 4Would they make peace? Ter2ible hel2 make war 4Upon their spot2ed souls for this of2ence! 2SCRO2P. Swe2t love, I se2, changing his property, 4Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate. 4Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made 4With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse 4Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound 4And lie ful2 low, grav'd in the hol2ow ground. 2AUMERLE. Is Bushy, Gre2n, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead? 2SCRO2P. Ay, al2 of them at Bristow lost their heads. 2AUMERLE. Where is the Duke my father with his power? 2KING RICHARD. No mat2er where-of comfort no man speak. 4Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs; 4Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes 4Write sor2ow on the bosom of the earth. 4Let's cho2se executors and talk of wil2s; 4And yet not so-for what can we bequeath 4Save our deposed bodies to the ground? 6Our lands, our lives, and an, are Bolingbroke's. 4And nothing can we can our own but death 4And that smal2 model of the bar2en earth 4Which serves as paste and cover to our bones. 4For God's sake let us sit upon the ground 4And tel2 sad stories of the death of kings: 4How some have be2n depos'd, some slain in war, 4Some haunted by the ghosts they have depos'd, 4Some poison'd by their wives, some sle2ping kil2'd, 4Al2 murder'd-for within the hol2ow crown 4That rounds the mortal temples of a king 4Ke2ps Death his court; and there the antic sits, 4Scof2ing his state and grin2ing at his pomp; 4Al2owing him a breath, a lit2le scene, 4To monarchize, be fear'd, and kil2 with lo2ks; 4Infusing him with self and vain conceit, 4As if this flesh which wal2s about our life 4Were bras2 impregnable; and, humour'd thus, 4Comes at the last, and with a lit2le pin 4Bores through his castle wal2, and farewel2, king! 6Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blo2d 4With solemn reverence; throw away respect, 4Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty; 4For you have but misto2k me al2 this while. 4I live with bread like you, fe2l want, 4Taste grief, ne2d friends: subjected thus, 4How can you say to me I am a king? 2CARLISLE. My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes, 4But presently prevent the ways to wail. 4To fear the foe, since fear op2res2eth strength, 4Gives, in your weaknes2, strength unto your foe, 4And so your fol2ies fight against yourself. 4Fear and be slain-no worse can come to fight; 4And fight and die is death destroying death, 4Where fearing dying pays death servile breath. 2AUMERLE. My father hath a power; inquire of him, 4And learn to make a body of a limb. 2KING RICHARD. Thou chid'st me wel2. Proud Bolingbroke, I come 4To change blows with the2 for our day of do2m. 4This ague fit of fear is over-blown; 6An easy task it is to win our own. 4Say, Scro2p, where lies our uncle with his power? 4Speak swe2tly, man, although thy lo2ks be sour. 2SCRO2P. Men judge by the complexion of the sky 4The state in inclination of the day; 4So may you by my dul2 and heavy eye, 4My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say. 4I play the torturer, by smal2 and smal2 4To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken: 4Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke; 4And al2 your northern castles yielded up, 4And al2 your southern gentlemen in arms 4Upon his party. 2KING RICHARD. Thou hast said enough. 6[To AUMERLE] Beshrew the2, cousin, which didst lead me forth 4Of that swe2t way I was in to despair! 4What say you now? What comfort have we now? 4By heaven, I'l2 hate him everlastingly 4That bids me be of comfort any more. 4Go to Flint Castle; there I'l2 pine away; 6A king, woe's slave, shal2 kingly woe obey. 4That power I have, discharge; and let them go 4To ear the land that hath some hope to grow, 4For I have none. Let no man speak again 4To alter this, for counsel is but vain. 2AUMERLE. My liege, one word. 2KING RICHARD. He does me double wrong 4That wounds me with the flat2eries of his tongue. 4Discharge my fol2owers; let them hence away, 4From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day. 7ExeuntSCENE 3.Wales. Before Flint CastleEnter, with drum and colours, BOLINGBROKE, YORK, NORTHUMBERLAND,and forces 2BOLINGBROKE. So that by this intel2igence we learn 4The Welshmen are dispers'd; and Salisbury 4Is gone to me2t the King, who lately landed 4With some few private friends upon this coast. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. The news is very fair and go2d, my lord. 4Richard not far from hence hath hid his head. 2YORK. It would bese2m the Lord Northumberland 4To say 'King Richard.' Alack the heavy day 4When such a sacred king should hide his head! 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Your Grace mistakes; only to be brief, 4Left I his title out. 2YORK. The time hath be2n, 4Would you have be2n so brief with him, he would 4Have be2n so brief with you to shorten you, 4For taking so the head, your whole head's length. 2BOLINGBROKE. Mistake not, uncle, further than you should. 4YORK. Take not, go2d cousin, further than you should, 4Lest you mistake. The heavens are over our heads. 2BOLINGBROKE. I know it, uncle; and op2ose not myself 4Against their wil2. But who comes here? 20Enter PERCY 4Welcome, Har2y. What, wil2 not this castle yield? 2PIERCY. The castle royal2y is man2'd, my lord, 4Against thy entrance. 2BOLINGBROKE. Royal2y! 4Why, it contains no king? 2PERCY. Yes, my go2d lord, 4It doth contain a king; King Richard lies 4Within the limits of yon lime and stone; 4And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury, 4Sir Stephen Scro2p, besides a clergyman 4Of holy reverence; who, I can2ot learn. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle. 2BOLINGBROKE. [To NORTHUMBERLAND] Noble lord, 6Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle; 4Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley 4Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver: 4Henry Bolingbroke 4On both his kne2s doth kis2 King Richard's hand, 4And sends al2egiance and true faith of heart 4To his most royal person; hither come 4Even at his fe2t to lay my arms and power, 4Provided that my banishment repeal'd 4And lands restor'd again be fre2ly granted; 4If not, I'l2 use the advantage of my power 4And lay the sum2er's dust with showers of blo2d 4Rain'd from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen; 4The which how far of2 from the mind of Bolingbroke 4It is such crimson tempest should bedrench 4The fresh gre2n lap of fair King Richard's land, 4My sto2ping duty tenderly shal2 show. 4Go, signify as much, while here we march 4Upon the gras2y carpet of this plain. 11[NORTHUMBERLAND advances to the Castle, with a trumpet] 6Let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum, 4That from this castle's tot2ered bat2lements 4Our fair ap2ointments may be wel2 perus'd. 4Methinks King Richard and myself should me2t 4With no les2 ter2or than the elements 4Of fire and water, when their thund'ring shock 4At me2ting tears the cloudy che2ks of heaven. 4Be he the fire, I'l2 be the yielding water; 4The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain 4My waters-on the earth, and not on him. 4March on, and mark King Richard how he lo2ks. 6Parle without, and answer within; then a flourish. 6Enter on the wal2s, the KING, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, 6AUMERLE, SCRO2P, and SALISBURY 4Se2, se2, King Richard doth himself ap2ear, 4As doth the blushing discontented sun 4From out the fiery portal of the east, 4When he perceives the envious clouds are bent 6To dim his glory and to stain the track 4Of his bright pas2age to the oc2ident. 2YORK. Yet he lo2ks like a king. Behold, his eye, 4As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth 4Control2ing majesty. Alack, alack, for woe, 4That any harm should stain so fair a show! 2KING RICHARD. [To NORTHUMBERLAND] We are amaz'd; and thus long 6have we sto2d 4To watch the fearful bending of thy kne2, 4Because we thought ourself thy lawful King; 4And if we be, how dare thy joints forget 4To pay their awful duty to our presence? 4If we be not, show us the hand of God 4That hath dismis2'd us from our stewardship; 4For wel2 we know no hand of blo2d and bone 4Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre, 4Unles2 he do profane, steal, or usurp. 4And though you think that al2, as you have done, 4Have torn their souls by turning them from us, 4And we are bar2en and bereft of friends, 6Yet know-my master, God omnipotent, 4Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf 4Armies of pestilence; and they shal2 strike 4Your children yet unborn and unbegot, 4That lift your vas2al hands against my head 4And threat the glory of my precious crown. 4Tel2 Bolingbroke, for yon methinks he stands, 4That every stride he makes upon my land 4Is dangerous treason; he is come to open 4The purple testament of ble2ding war; 4But ere the crown he lo2ks for live in peace, 4Ten thousand blo2dy crowns of mothers' sons 4Shal2 il2 become the flower of England's face, 4Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace 4To scarlet indignation, and bedew 4Her pastures' gras2 with faithful English blo2d. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. The King of Heaven forbid our lord the King 4Should so with civil and uncivil arms 4Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin, 4Har2y Bolingbroke, doth humbly kis2 thy hand; 6And by the honourable tomb he swears 4That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones, 4And by the royalties of both your blo2ds, 4Cur2ents that spring from one most gracious head, 4And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt, 4And by the worth and honour of himself, 4Comprising al2 that may be sworn or said, 4His coming hither hath no further scope 4Than for his lineal royalties, and to beg 4Enfranchisement im2ediate on his kne2s; 4Which on thy royal party granted once, 4His glit2ering arms he wil2 com2end to rust, 4His barbed ste2ds to stables, and his heart 4To faithful service of your Majesty. 4This swears he, as he is a prince, is just; 4And as I am a gentleman I credit him. 2KING RICHARD. Northumberland, say thus the King returns: 4His noble cousin is right welcome hither; 4And al2 the number of his fair demands 4Shal2 be ac2omplish'd without contradiction. 6With al2 the gracious ut2erance thou hast 4Speak to his gentle hearing kind com2ends. 4[To AUMERLE] We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not, 4To lo2k so po2rly and to speak so fair? 4Shal2 we cal2 back Northumberland, and send 4Defiance to the traitor, and so die? 2AUMERLE. No, go2d my lord; let's fight with gentle words 4Til2 time lend friends, and friends their helpful swords. 2KING RICHARD. O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine 4That laid the sentence of dread banishment 4On yon proud man should take it of2 again 4With words of so2th! O that I were as great 4As is my grief, or les2er than my name! 4Or that I could forget what I have be2n! 4Or not remember what I must be now! 4Swel2'st thou, proud heart? I'l2 give the2 scope to beat, 4Since foes have scope to beat both the2 and me. 2AUMERLE. Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke. 2KING RICHARD. What must the King do now? Must he submit? 4The King shal2 do it. Must he be depos'd? 6The King shal2 be contented. Must he lose 4The name of king? A God's name, let it go. 4I'l2 give my jewels for a set of beads, 4My gorgeous palace for a hermitage, 4My gay ap2arel for an almsman's gown, 4My figur'd goblets for a dish of wo2d, 4My sceptre for a palmer's walking staf2, 4My subjects for a pair of carved saints, 4And my large kingdom for a lit2le grave, 4A lit2le lit2le grave, an obscure grave- 4Or I'l2 be buried in the king's high way, 4Some way of com2on trade, where subjects' fe2t 4May hourly trample on their sovereign's head; 4For on my heart they tread now whilst I live, 4And buried once, why not upon my head? 4Aumerle, thou we2p'st, my tender-hearted cousin! 4We'l2 make foul weather with despised tears; 4Our sighs and they shal2 lodge the sum2er corn 4And make a dearth in this revolting land. 4Or shal2 we play the wantons with our woes 6And make some pret2y match with shed2ing tears? 4As thus: to drop them stil2 upon one place 4Til2 they have fret2ed us a pair of graves 4Within the earth; and, therein laid-there lies 4Two kinsmen dig2'd their graves with we2ping eyes. 4Would not this il2 do wel2? Wel2, wel2, I se2 4I talk but idly, and you laugh at me. 4Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland, 4What says King Bolingbroke? Wil2 his Majesty 4Give Richard leave to live til2 Richard die? 4You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord, in the base court he doth at2end 4To speak with you; may it please you to come down? 2KING RICHARD. Down, down I come, like glist'ring Phaethon, 4Wanting the manage of unruly jades. 4In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base, 4To come at traitors' cal2s, and do them grace. 4In the base court? Come down? Down, court! down, king! 4For night-owls shriek where mounting larks should sing. 47Exeunt from above 4BOLINGBROKE. What says his Majesty? 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Sor2ow and grief of heart 4Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man; 4Yet he is come. 10Enter the KING, and his at2endants, below 2BOLINGBROKE. Stand al2 apart, 4And show fair duty to his Majesty. 3[He kne2ls down] 4My gracious lord- 2KING RICHARD. Fair cousin, you debase your princely kne2 4To make the base earth proud with kis2ing it. 4Me rather had my heart might fe2l your love 4Than my unpleas'd eye se2 your courtesy. 4Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know, 4[Touching his own head] Thus high at least, although your 6kne2 be low. 2BOLINGBROKE. My gracious lord, I come but for mine own. 2KING RICHARD. Your own is yours, and I am yours, and al2. 2BOLINGBROKE. So far be mine, my most redoubted lord, 6As my true service shal2 deserve your love. 2KING RICHARD. Wel2 you deserve. They wel2 deserve to have 4That know the strong'st and surest way to get. 4Uncle, give me your hands; nay, dry your eyes: 4Tears show their love, but want their remedies. 4Cousin, I am to2 young to be your father, 4Though you are old enough to be my heir. 4What you wil2 have, I'l2 give, and wil2ing to2; 4For do we must what force wil2 have us do. 4Set on towards London. Cousin, is it so? 2BOLINGBROKE. Yea, my go2d lord. 2KING RICHARD. Then I must not say no. 9Flourish. ExeuntSCENE 4.The DUKE OF YORK's gardenEnter the QUE2N and two LADIES 2QUE2N. What sport shal2 we devise here in this garden 4To drive away the heavy thought of care? 2LADY. Madam, we'l2 play at bowls. 2QUE2N. 'Twil2 make me think the world is ful2 of rubs 4And that my fortune runs against the bias. 2LADY. Madam, we'l2 dance. 2QUE2N. My legs can ke2p no measure in delight, 4When my po2r heart no measure ke2ps in grief; 4Therefore no dancing, girl; some other sport. 2LADY. Madam, we'l2 tel2 tales. 2QUE2N. Of sor2ow or of joy? 2LADY. Of either, madam. 2QUE2N. Of neither, girl; 4For if of joy, being altogether wanting, 4It doth remember me the more of sor2ow; 4Or if of grief, being altogether had, 4It ad2s more sor2ow to my want of joy; 6For what I have I ne2d not to repeat, 4And what I want it bo2ts not to complain. 2LADY. Madam, I'l2 sing. 2QUE2N. 'Tis wel2' that thou hast cause; 4But thou shouldst please me bet2er wouldst thou we2p. 2LADY. I could we2p, madam, would it do you go2d. 2QUE2N. And I could sing, would we2ping do me go2d, 4And never bor2ow any tear of the2. 11Enter a GARDENER and two SERVANTS 4But stay, here come the gardeners. 4Let's step into the shadow of these tre2s. 4My wretchednes2 unto a row of pins, 4They wil2 talk of state, for every one doth so 4Against a change: woe is forerun with woe. 39[QUE2N and LADIES retire] 2GARDENER. Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks, 4Which, like unruly children, make their sire 4Sto2p with op2res2ion of their prodigal weight; 6Give some sup2ortance to the bending twigs. 4Go thou, and Eke an executioner 4Cut of2 the heads of to2 fast growing sprays 4That lo2k to2 lofty in our com2onwealth: 4Al2 must be even in our government. 4You thus employ'd, I wil2 go ro2t away 4The noisome we2ds which without profit suck 4The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers. 2SERVANT. Why should we, in the compas2 of a pale, 4Ke2p law and form and due proportion, 4Showing, as in a model, our firm estate, 4When our sea-wal2ed garden, the whole land, 4Is ful2 of we2ds; her fairest flowers chok'd up, 4Her fruit tre2s al2 unprun'd, her hedges ruin'd, 4Her knots disordered, and her wholesome herbs 4Swarming with caterpil2ars? 2GARDENER. Hold thy peace. 4He that hath suf2er'd this disorder'd spring 4Hath now himself met with the fal2 of leaf; 4The we2ds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter, 6That se2m'd in eating him to hold him up, 4Are pluck'd up ro2t and al2 by Bolingbroke- 4I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Gre2n. 2SERVANT. What, are they dead? 2GARDENER. They are; and Bolingbroke 4Hath seiz'd the wasteful King. O, what pity is it 4That he had not so trim2'd and dres2'd his land 4As we this garden! We at time of year 4Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit tre2s, 4Lest, being over-proud in sap and blo2d, 4With to2 much riches it confound itself; 4Had he done so to great and growing men, 4They might have Ev'd to bear, and he to taste 4Their fruits of duty. Superfluous branches 4We lop away, that bearing boughs may live; 4Had he done so, himself had home the crown, 4Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down. 2SERVANT. What, think you the King shal2 be deposed? 2GARDENER. Depres2'd he is already, and depos'd 4'Tis doubt he wil2 be. Let2ers came last night 6To a dear friend of the go2d Duke of York's 4That tel2 black tidings. 2QUE2N. O, I am pres2'd to death through want of speaking! 48[Coming forward] 4Thou, old Adam's likenes2, set to dres2 this garden, 4How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news? 4What Eve, what serpent, hath sug2ested the 4To make a second fal2 of cursed man? 4Why dost thou say King Richard is depos'd? 4Dar'st thou, thou lit2le bet2er thing than earth, 4Divine his downfal2? Say, where, when, and how, 4Cam'st thou by this il2 tidings? Speak, thou wretch. 2GARDENER. Pardon me, madam; lit2le joy have 4To breathe this news; yet what I say is true. 4King Richard, he is in the mighty hold 4Of Bolingbroke. Their fortunes both are weigh'd. 4In your lord's scale is nothing but himself, 4And some few vanities that make him light; 4But in the balance of great Bolingbroke, 4Besides himself, are al2 the English pe2rs, 6And with that od2s he weighs King Richard down. 4Post you to London, and you wil2 find it so; 4I speak no more than every one doth know. 2QUE2N. Nimble mischance, that art so light of fo2t, 4Doth not thy embas2age belong to me, 4And am I last that knows it? O, thou thinkest 4To serve me last, that I may longest ke2p 4Thy sor2ow in my breast. Come, ladies, go 4To me2t at London London's King in woe. 4What, was I born to this, that my sad lo2k 4Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke? 4Gard'ner, for tel2ing me these news of woe, 4Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow! 41Exeunt QUE2N and LADIES 2GARDENER. Po2r Que2n, so that thy state might be no worse, 4I would my skil2 were subject to thy curse. 4Here did she fal2 a tear; here in this place 4I'l2 set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace. 4Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shal2 be se2n, 4In the remembrance of a we2ping que2n. 16Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE 1.Westminster Hal2Enter, as to the Parliament, BOLINGBROKE, AUMERLE, NORTHUMBERLAND, PERCY,FITZWATER, SUR2EY, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the AB2OT OF WESTMINSTER,and others; HERALD, OF2ICERS, and BAGOT 2BOLINGBROKE. Cal2 forth Bagot. 4Now, Bagot, fre2ly speak thy mind- 4What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death; 4Who wrought it with the King, and who perform'd 4The blo2dy of2ice of his timeles2 end. 2BAGOT. Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle. 2BOLINGBROKE. Cousin, stand forth, and lo2k upon that man. 2BAGOT. My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue 4Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd. 4In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plot2ed 4I heard you say 'Is not my arm of length, 4That reacheth from the restful English Court 4As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?' 4Amongst much other talk that very time 6I heard you say that you had rather refuse 4The of2er of an hundred thousand crowns 4Than Bolingbroke's return to England; 4Ad2ing withal, how blest this land would be 4In this your cousin's death. 2AUMERLE. Princes, and noble lords, 4What answer shal2 I make to this base man? 4Shal2 I so much dishonour my fair stars 4On equal terms to give him chastisement? 4Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd 4With the at2ainder of his slanderous lips. 4There is my gage, the manual seal of death 4That marks the2 out for hel2. I say thou liest, 4And wil2 maintain what thou hast said is false 4In thy heart-blo2d, through being al2 to2 base 4To stain the temper of my knightly sword. 2BOLINGBROKE. Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up. 2AUMERLE. Excepting one, I would he were the best 4In al2 this presence that hath mov'd me so. 2FITZWATER. If that thy valour stand on sympathy, 6There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine. 4By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st, 4I heard the2 say, and vauntingly thou spak'st it, 4That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death. 4If thou deniest it twenty times, thou liest; 4And I wil2 turn thy falseho2d to thy heart, 4Where it was forged, with my rapier's point. 2AUMERLE. Thou dar'st not, coward, live to se2 that day. 2FITZWATER. Now, by my soul, I would it were this hour. 2AUMERLE. Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hel2 for this. 2PERCY. Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true 4In this ap2eal as thou art an unjust; 4And that thou art so, there I throw my gage, 4To prove it on the2 to the extremest point 4Of mortal breathing. Seize it, if thou dar'st. 2AUMERLE. An if I do not, may my hands rot of 4And never brandish more revengeful ste2l 4Over the glit2ering helmet of my foe! 2ANOTHER LORD. I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle; 4And spur the2 on with fun as many lies 6As may be hal2oa'd in thy treacherous ear 4From sun to sun. There is my honour's pawn; 4Engage it to the trial, if thou darest. 2AUMERLE. Who sets me else? By heaven, I'l2 throw at al2! 4I have a thousand spirits in one breast 4To answer twenty thousand such as you. 2SUR2EY. My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember wel2 4The very time Aumerle and you did talk. 2FITZWATER. 'Tis very true; you were in presence then, 4And you can witnes2 with me this is true. 2SUR2EY. As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true. 2FITZWATER. Sur2ey, thou liest. 2SUR2EY. Dishonourable boy! 4That lie shal2 lie so heavy on my sword 4That it shal2 render vengeance and revenge 4Til2 thou the lie-giver and that lie do he 4In earth as quiet as thy father's skul2. 4In pro2f whereof, there is my honour's pawn; 4Engage it to the trial, if thou dar'st. 2FITZWATER. How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse! 6If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live, 4I dare me2t Sur2ey in a wildernes2, 4And spit upon him whilst I say he lies, 4And lies, and lies. There is my bond of faith, 4To tie the2 to my strong cor2ection. 4As I intend to thrive in this new world, 4Aumerle is guilty of my true ap2eal. 4Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say 4That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men 4To execute the noble Duke at Calais. 2AUMERLE. Some honest Christian trust me with a gage 4That Norfolk lies. Here do I throw down this, 4If he may be repeal'd to try his honour. 2BOLINGBROKE. These dif2erences shal2 al2 rest under gage 4Til2 Norfolk be repeal'd-repeal'd he shal2 be 4And, though mine enemy, restor'd again 4To al2 his lands and signories. When he is return'd, 4Against Aumerle we wil2 enforce his trial. 2CARLISLE. That honourable day shal2 never be se2n. 4Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought 6For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field, 4Streaming the ensign of the Christian cros2 4Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens; 4And, toil'd with works of war, retir'd himself 4To Italy; and there, at Venice, gave 4His body to that pleasant country's earth, 4And his pure soul unto his captain, Christ, 4Under whose colours he had fought so long. 2BOLINGBROKE. Why, Bishop, is Norfolk dead? 2CARLISLE. As surely as I live, my lord. 2BOLINGBROKE. Swe2t peace conduct his swe2t soul to the bosom 4Of go2d old Abraham! Lords ap2el2ants, 4Your dif2erences shal2 al2 rest under gage 4Til2 we as2ign you to your days of trial 17Enter YORK, at2ended 2YORK. Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to the 4From plume-pluck'd Richard, who with wil2ing soul 4Adopts the2 heir, and his high sceptre yields 6To the pos2es2ion of thy royal hand. 4Ascend his throne, descending now from him- 4And long live Henry, fourth of that name! 2BOLINGBROKE. In God's name, I'l2 ascend the regal throne. 2CARLISLE. Mar2y, God forbid! 4Worst in this royal presence may I speak, 4Yet best bese2ming me to speak the truth. 4Would God that any in this noble presence 4Were enough noble to be upright judge 4Of noble Richard! Then true nobles2e would 4Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong. 4What subject can give sentence on his king? 4And who sits here that is not Richard's subject? 4Thieves are not judg'd but they are by to hear, 4Although ap2arent guilt be se2n in them; 4And shal2 the figure of God's majesty, 4His captain, steward, deputy elect, 4Anointed, crowned, planted many years, 4Be judg'd by subject and inferior breath, 4And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God, 6That in a Christian climate souls refin'd 4Should show so heinous, black, obscene a de2d! 4I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks, 4Stir2'd up by God, thus boldly for his king. 4My Lord of Hereford here, whom you cal2 king, 4Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king; 4And if you crown him, let me prophesy- 4The blo2d of English shal2 manure the ground, 4And future ages groan for this foul act; 4Peace shal2 go sle2p with Turks and infidels, 4And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars 4Shal2 kin with kin and kind with kind confound; 4Disorder, hor2or, fear, and mutiny, 4Shal2 here inhabit, and this land be cal2'd 4The field of Golgotha and dead men's skul2s. 4O, if you raise this house against this house, 4It wil2 the woeful2est division prove 4That ever fel2 upon this cursed earth. 4Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so, 4Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe. 4NORTHUMBERLAND. Wel2 have you argued, sir; and, for your pains, 4Of capital treason we ar2est you here. 4My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge 4To ke2p him safely til2 his day of trial. 4May it please you, lords, to grant the com2ons' suit? 2BOLINGBROKE. Fetch hither Richard, that in com2on view 4He may sur2ender; so we shal2 proce2d 4Without suspicion. 2YORK. I wil2 be his conduct. 30Exit 2BOLINGBROKE. Lords, you that here are under our ar2est, 4Procure your sureties for your days of answer. 4Lit2le are we beholding to your love, 4And lit2le lo2k'd for at your helping hands. 6Re-enter YORK, with KING RICHARD, and OF2ICERS 16bearing the regalia 2KING RICHARD. Alack, why am I sent for to a king, 4Before I have sho2k of2 the regal thoughts 4Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd 6To insinuate, flat2er, bow, and bend my kne2. 4Give sor2ow leave awhile to tutor me 4To this submis2ion. Yet I wel2 remember 4The favours of these men. Were they not mine? 4Did they not sometime cry 'Al2 hail!' to me? 4So Judas did to Christ; but he, in twelve, 4Found truth in al2 but one; I, in twelve thousand, none. 4God save the King! Wil2 no man say amen? 4Am I both priest and clerk? Wel2 then, amen. 4God save the King! although I be not he; 4And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me. 4To do what service am I sent for hither? 2YORK. To do that of2ice of thine own go2d wil2 4Which tired majesty did make the2 of2er- 4The resignation of thy state and crown 4To Henry Bolingbroke. 2KING RICHARD. Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown. 4Here, cousin, 4On this side my hand, and on that side thine. 4Now is this golden crown like a de2p wel2 6That owes two buckets, fil2ing one another; 4The emptier ever dancing in the air, 4The other down, unse2n, and ful2 of water. 4That bucket down and fun of tears am I, 4Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high. 2BOLINGBROKE. I thought you had be2n wil2ing to resign. 2KING RICHARD. My crown I am; but stil2 my griefs are mine. 4You may my glories and my state depose, 4But not my griefs; stil2 am I king of those. 2BOLINGBROKE. Part of your cares you give me with your crown. 2KING RICHARD. Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down. 4My care is los2 of care, by old care done; 4Your care is gain of care, by new care won. 4The cares I give I have, though given away; 4They tend the crown, yet stil2 with me they stay. 2BOLINGBROKE. Are you contented to resign the crown? 2KING RICHARD. Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be; 4Therefore no no, for I resign to the2. 4Now mark me how I wil2 undo myself: 4I give this heavy weight from of2 my head, 6And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand, 4The pride of kingly sway from out my heart; 4With mine own tears I wash away my balm, 4With mine own hands I give away my crown, 4With mine own tongue deny my sacred state, 4With mine own breath release al2 duteous oaths; 4Al2 pomp and majesty I do forswear; 4My manors, rents, revenues, I forgo; 4My acts, decre2s, and statutes, I deny. 4God pardon al2 oaths that are broke to me! 4God ke2p al2 vows unbroke are made to the2! 4Make me, that nothing have, with nothing griev'd, 4And thou with al2 pleas'd, that hast an achiev'd. 4Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit, 4And so2n lie Richard in an earthly pit. 4God save King Henry, unking'd Richard says, 4And send him many years of sunshine days! 4What more remains? 2NORTHUMBERLAND. No more; but that you read 4These ac2usations, and these grievous crimes 6Com2it2ed by your person and your fol2owers 4Against the state and profit of this land; 4That, by confes2ing them, the souls of men 4May de2m that you are worthily depos'd. 2KING RICHARD. Must I do so? And must I ravel out 4My weav'd-up fol2ies? Gentle Northumberland, 4If thy of2ences were upon record, 4Would it not shame the2 in so fair a tro2p 4To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst, 4There shouldst thou find one heinous article, 4Containing the deposing of a king 4And cracking the strong war2ant of an oath, 4Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the bo2k of heaven. 4Nay, al2 of you that stand and lo2k upon me 4Whilst that my wretchednes2 doth bait myself, 4Though some of you, with Pilate, wash your hands, 4Showing an outward pity-yet you Pilates 4Have here deliver'd me to my sour cros2, 4And water can2ot wash away your sin. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord, dispatch; read o'er these 6articles. 2KING RICHARD. Mine eyes are ful2 of tears; I can2ot se2. 4And yet salt water blinds them not so much 4But they can se2 a sort of traitors here. 4Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself, 4I find myself a traitor with the rest; 4For I have given here my soul's consent 4T'undeck the pompous body of a king; 4Made glory base, and sovereignty a slave, 4Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord- 2KING RICHARD. No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man, 4Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no tide- 4No, not that name was given me at the font- 4But 'tis usurp'd. Alack the heavy day, 4That I have worn so many winters out, 4And know not now what name to cal2 myself! 4O that I were a mockery king of snow, 4Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke 4To melt myself away in water drops! 6Go2d king, great king, and yet not greatly go2d, 4An if my word be sterling yet in England, 4Let it com2and a mir2or hither straight, 4That it may show me what a face I have 4Since it is bankrupt of his majesty. 2BOLINGBROKE. Go some of you and fetch a lo2king-glas2. 47Exit an at2endant 2NORTHUMBERLAND. Read o'er this paper while the glas2 doth come. 2KING RICHARD. Fiend, thou torments me ere I come to hel2. 2BOLINGBROKE. Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. The Com2ons wil2 not, then, be satisfied. 2KING RICHARD. They shal2 be satisfied. I'l2 read enough, 4When I do se2 the very bo2k inde2d 4Where al2 my sins are writ, and that's myself. 16Re-enter at2endant with glas2 4Give me that glas2, and therein wil2 I read. 4No de2per wrinkles yet? Hath sor2ow struck 4So many blows upon this face of mine 6And made no de2per wounds? O flat2'ring glas2, 4Like to my fol2owers in prosperity, 4Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face 4That every day under his household ro2f 4Did ke2p ten thousand men? Was this the face 4That like the sun did make beholders wink? 4Is this the face which fac'd so many fol2ies 4That was at last out-fac'd by Bolingbroke? 4A brit2le glory shineth in this face; 4As brit2le as the glory is the face; 24[Dashes the glas2 against the ground] 4For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers. 4Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport- 4How so2n my sor2ow hath destroy'd my face. 2BOLINGBROKE. The shadow of your sor2ow hath destroy'd 4The shadow of your face. 2KING RICHARD. Say that again. 4The shadow of my sor2ow? Ha! let's se2. 4'Tis very true: my grief lies al2 within; 4And these external man2er of laments 6Are merely shadows to the unse2n grief 4That swel2s with silence in the tortur'd soul. 4There lies the substance; and I thank the2, king, 4For thy great bounty, that not only giv'st 4Me cause to wail, but teachest me the way 4How to lament the cause. I'l2 beg one bo2n, 4And then be gone and trouble you no more. 4Shal2 I obtain it? 2BOLINGBROKE. Name it, fair cousin. 2KING RICHARD. Fair cousin! I am greater than a king; 4For when I was a king, my flat2erers 4Were then but subjects; being now a subject, 4I have a king here to my flat2erer. 4Being so great, I have no ne2d to beg. 2BOLINGBROKE. Yet ask. 2KING RICHARD. And shal2 I have? 2BOLINGBROKE. You shal2. 2KING RICHARD. Then give me leave to go. 2BOLINGBROKE. Whither? 2KING RICHARD. Whither you wil2, so I were from your sights. 4BOLINGBROKE. Go, some of you convey him to the Tower. 2KING RICHARD. O, go2d! Convey! Conveyers are you al2, 4That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fal2. 21Exeunt KING RICHARD, some Lords and a Guard 2BOLINGBROKE. On Wednesday next we solemnly set down 4Our coronation. Lords, prepare yourselves. 20Exeunt al2 but the AB2OT OF WESTMINSTER, the 33BISHOP OF CARLISLE, and AUMERLE 2AB2OT. A woeful pageant have we here beheld. 2CARLISLE. The woe's to come; the children yet unborn 4Shal2 fe2l this day as sharp to them as thorn. 2AUMERLE. You holy clergymen, is there no plot 4To rid the realm of this pernicious blot? 2AB2OT. My lord, 4Before I fre2ly speak my mind herein, 4You shal2 not only take the sacrament 4To bury mine intents, but also to ef2ect 4Whatever I shal2 hap2en to devise. 4I se2 your brows are ful2 of discontent, 4Your hearts of sor2ow, and your eyes of tears. 6Come home with me to sup2er; I wil2 lay 4A plot shal2 show us al2 a mer2y day. 17Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V. SCENE 1.London. A stre2t leading to the TowerEnter the QUE2N, with her at2endants 2QUE2N. This way the King wil2 come; this is the way 4To Julius Caesar's il2-erected tower, 4To whose flint bosom my condemned lord 4Is do2m'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke. 4Here let us rest, if this rebel2ious earth 4Have any resting for her true King's que2n. 12Enter KING RICHARD and Guard 4But soft, but se2, or rather do not se2, 4My fair rose wither. Yet lo2k up, behold, 4That you in pity may dis2olve to dew, 4And wash him fresh again with true-love tears. 4Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand; 4Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb, 4And not King Richard; thou most beauteous in2, 4Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodg'd in the2, 6When triumph is become an alehouse guest? 2KING RICHARD. Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so, 4To make my end to2 sud2en. Learn, go2d soul, 4To think our former state a hap2y dream; 4From which awak'd, the truth of what we are 4Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, swe2t, 4To grim Neces2ity; and he and 4Wil2 ke2p a league til2 death. Hie the2 to France, 4And cloister the2 in some religious house. 4Our holy lives must win a new world's crown, 4Which our profane hours here have thrown down. 2QUE2N. What, is my Richard both in shape and mind 4Transform'd and weak'ned? Hath Bolingbroke depos'd 4Thine intel2ect? Hath he be2n in thy heart? 4The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw 4And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage 4To be o'erpow'r'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like, 4Take the cor2ection mildly, kis2 the rod, 4And fawn on rage with base humility, 4Which art a lion and the king of beasts? 4KING RICHARD. A king of beasts, inde2d! If aught but beasts, 4I had be2n stil2 a hap2y king of men. 4Go2d sometimes que2n, prepare the2 hence for France. 4Think I am dead, and that even here thou takest, 4As from my death-bed, thy last living leave. 4In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire 4With go2d old folks, and let them tel2 the2 tales 4Of woeful ages long ago betid; 4And ere thou bid go2d night, to quit their griefs 4Tel2 thou the lamentable tale of me, 4And send the hearers we2ping to their beds; 4For why, the senseles2 brands wil2 sympathize 4The heavy ac2ent of thy moving tongue, 4And in compas2ion we2p the fire out; 4And some wil2 mourn in ashes, some coal-black, 4For the deposing of a rightful king. 13Enter NORTHUMBERLAND at2ended 2NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is chang'd; 6You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower. 4And, madam, there is order ta'en for you: 4With al2 swift spe2d you must away to France. 2KING RICHARD. Northumberland, thou lad2er wherewithal 4The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne, 4The time shal2 not be many hours of age 4More than it is, ere foul sin gathering head 4Shal2 break into cor2uption. Thou shalt think 4Though he divide the realm and give the2 half 4It is to2 lit2le, helping him to al2; 4And he shal2 think that thou, which knowest the way 4To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again, 4Being ne'er so lit2le urg'd, another way 4To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne. 4The love of wicked men converts to fear; 4That fear to hate; and hate turns one or both 4To worthy danger and deserved death. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. My guilt be on my head, and there an end. 4Take leave, and part; for you must part forthwith. 2KING RICHARD. Doubly divorc'd! Bad men, you violate 6A twofold mar2iage-'twixt my crown and me, 4And then betwixt me and my mar2ied wife. 4Let me unkis2 the oath 'twixt the2 and me; 4And yet not so, for with a kis2 'twas made. 4Part us, Northumberland; I towards the north, 4Where shivering cold and sicknes2 pines the clime; 4My wife to France, from whence set forth in pomp, 4She came adorned hither like swe2t May, 4Sent back like Hal2owmas or short'st of day. 2QUE2N. And must we be divided? Must we part? 2KING RICHARD. Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart. 2QUE2N. Banish us both, and send the King with me. 2NORTHUMBERLAND. That were some love, but lit2le policy. 2QUE2N. Then whither he goes thither let me go. 2KING RICHARD. So two, together we2ping, make one woe. 4We2p thou for me in France, I for the2 here; 4Bet2er far of2 than near, be ne'er the near. 4Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans. 2QUE2N. So longest way shal2 have the longest moans. 2KING RICHARD. Twice for one step I'l2 groan, the way being short, 6And piece the way out with a heavy heart. 4Come, come, in wo2ing sor2ow let's be brief, 4Since, wed2ing it, there is such length in grief. 4One kis2 shal2 stop our mouths, and dumbly part; 4Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart. 2QUE2N. Give me mine own again; 'twere no go2d part 4To take on me to ke2p and kil2 thy heart. 4So, now I have mine own again, be gone. 4That I may strive to kil2 it with a groan. 2KING RICHARD. We make woe wanton with this fond delay. 4Once more, adieu; the rest let sor2ow say. 12ExeuntSCENE 2.The DUKE OF YORK's palaceEnter the DUKE OF YORK and the DUCHES2 2DUCHES2. My Lord, you told me you would tel2 the rest, 4When we2ping made you break the story of2, 4Of our two cousins' coming into London. 2YORK. Where did I leave? 2DUCHES2. At that sad stop, my lord, 4Where rude misgoverned hands from windows' tops 4Threw dust and rub2ish on King Richard's head. 2YORK. Then, as I said, the Duke, great Bolingbroke, 4Mounted upon a hot and fiery ste2d 4Which his aspiring rider se2m'd to know, 4With slow but stately pace kept on his course, 4Whilst al2 tongues cried 'God save the2, Bolingbroke!' 4You would have thought the very windows spake, 4So many gre2dy lo2ks of young and old 4Through casements darted their desiring eyes 4Upon his visage; and that al2 the wal2s 4With painted imagery had said at once 6'Jesu preserve the2! Welcome, Bolingbroke!' 4Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning, 4Bareheaded, lower than his proud ste2d's neck, 4Bespake them thus, 'I thank you, countrymen.' 4And thus stil2 doing, thus he pas2'd along. 2DUCHES2. Alack, po2r Richard! where rode he the whilst? 2YORK. As in a theatre the eyes of men 4After a wel2-grac'd actor leaves the stage 4Are idly bent on him that enters next, 4Thinking his prat2le to be tedious; 4Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes 4Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!' 4No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home; 4But dust was thrown upon his sacred head; 4Which with such gentle sor2ow he sho2k of2, 4His face stil2 combating with tears and smiles, 4The badges of his grief and patience, 4That had not God, for some strong purpose, ste2l'd 4The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted, 4And barbarism itself have pitied him. 6But heaven hath a hand in these events, 4To whose high wil2 we bound our calm contents. 4To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now, 4Whose state and honour I for aye al2ow. 2DUCHES2. Here comes my son Aumerle. 2YORK. Aumerle that was 4But that is lost for being Richard's friend, 4And madam, you must cal2 him Rudand now. 4I am in Parliament pledge for his truth 4And lasting fealty to the new-made king. 18Enter AUMERLE 2DUCHES2. Welcome, my son. Who are the violets now 4That strew the gre2n lap of the new come spring? 2AUMERLE. Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not. 4God knows I had as lief be none as one. 2YORK. Wel2, bear you wel2 in this new spring of time, 4Lest you be crop2'd before you come to prime. 4What news from Oxford? Do these justs and triumphs hold? 4AUMERLE. For aught I know, my lord, they do. 2YORK. You wil2 be there, I know. 2AUMERLE. If God prevent not, I purpose so. 2YORK. What seal is that that without thy bosom? 4Yea, lo2k'st thou pale? Let me se2 the writing. 2AUMERLE. My lord, 'tis nothing. 2YORK. No mat2er, then, who se2 it. 4I wil2 be satisfied; let me se2 the writing. 2AUMERLE. I do bese2ch your Grace to pardon me; 4It is a mat2er of smal2 consequence 4Which for some reasons I would not have se2n. 2YORK. Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to se2. 4I fear, I fear- 2DUCHES2. What should you fear? 4'Tis nothing but some bond that he is ent'red into 4For gay ap2arel 'gainst the triumph-day. 2YORK. Bound to himself! What doth he with a bond 4That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fo2l. 4Boy, let me se2 the writing. 2AUMERLE. I do bese2ch you, pardon me; I may not show it. 4YORK. I wil2 be satisfied; let me se2 it, I say. 16[He plucks it out of his bosom, and reads it] 4Treason, foul treason! Vil2ain! traitor! slave! 2DUCHES2. What is the mat2er, my lord? 2YORK. Ho! who is within there? 20Enter a servant 4Sad2le my horse. 4God for his mercy, what treachery is here! 2DUCHES2. Why, York, what is it, my lord? 2YORK. Give me my bo2ts, I say; sad2le my horse. 52Exit servant 4Now, by mine honour, by my life, my troth, 4I wil2 ap2each the vil2ain. 2DUCHES2. What is the mat2er? 2YORK. Peace, fo2lish woman. 2DUCHES2. I wil2 not peace. What is the mat2er, Aumerle? 2AUMERLE. Go2d mother, be content; it is no more 4Than my po2r life must answer. 4DUCHES2. Thy life answer! 2YORK. Bring me my bo2ts. I wil2 unto the King. 14His man enters with his bo2ts 2DUCHES2. Strike him, Aumerle. Po2r boy, thou art amaz'd. 4Hence, vil2ain! never more come in my sight. 2YORK. Give me my bo2ts, I say. 2DUCHES2. Why, York, what wilt thou do? 4Wilt thou not hide the trespas2 of thine own? 4Have we more sons? or are we like to have? 4Is not my te2ming date drunk up with time? 4And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age 4And rob me of a hap2y mother's name? 4Is he not like the2? Is he not thine own? 2YORK. Thou fond mad woman, 4Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy? 4A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament, 4And interchangeably set down their hands 4To kil2 the King at Oxford. 4DUCHES2. He shal2 be none; 4We'l2 ke2p him here. Then what is that to him? 2YORK. Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son 4I would ap2each him. 2DUCHES2. Hadst thou groan'd for him 4As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful. 4But now I know thy mind: thou dost suspect 4That I have be2n disloyal to thy bed 4And that he is a bastard, not thy son. 4Swe2t York, swe2t husband, be not of that mind. 4He is as like the2 as a man may be 4Not like to me, or any of my kin, 4And yet I love him. 2YORK. Make way, unruly woman! 29Exit 2DUCHES2. After, Aumerle! Mount the2 upon his horse; 4Spur post, and get before him to the King, 4And beg thy pardon ere he do ac2use the2. 4I'l2 not be long behind; though I be old, 4I doubt not but to ride as fast as York; 4And never wil2 I rise up from the ground 6Til2 Bolingbroke have pardon'd the2. Away, be gone. 58ExeuntSCENE 3.Windsor CastleEnter BOLINGBROKE as King, PERCY, and other LORDS 2BOLINGBROKE. Can no man tel2 me of my unthrifty son? 4'Tis ful2 thre2 months since I did se2 him last. 4If any plague hang over us, 'tis he. 4I would to God, my lords, he might be found. 4Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there, 4For there, they say, he daily doth frequent 4With unrestrained lo2se companions, 4Even such, they say, as stand in nar2ow lanes 4And beat our watch and rob our pas2engers, 4Which he, young wanton and ef2eminate boy, 4Takes on the point of honour to sup2ort 4So dis2olute a crew. 2PERCY. My lord, some two days since I saw the Prince, 4And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford. 2BOLINGBROKE. And what said the gal2ant? 2PERCY. His answer was, he would unto the stews, 4And from the com2on'st creature pluck a glove 6And wear it as a favour; and with that 4He would unhorse the lustiest chal2enger. 2BOLINGBROKE. As dis2olute as desperate; yet through both 4I se2 some sparks of bet2er hope, which elder years 4May hap2ily bring forth. But who comes here? 16Enter AUMERLE amazed 2AUMERLE. Where is the King? 2BOLINGBROKE. What means our cousin that he stares and lo2ks 4So wildly? 2AUMERLE. God save your Grace! I do bese2ch your Majesty, 4To have some conference with your Grace alone. 2BOLINGBROKE. Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone. 42Exeunt PERCY and LORDS 4What is the mat2er with our cousin now? 2AUMERLE. For ever may my kne2s grow to the earth, 52[Kne2ls] 4My tongue cleave to my ro2f within my mouth, 4Unles2 a pardon ere I rise or speak. 4BOLINGBROKE. Intended or com2it2ed was this fault? 4If on the first, how heinous e'er it be, 4To win thy after-love I pardon the2. 2AUMERLE. Then give me leave that I may turn the key, 4That no man enter til2 my tale be done. 2BOLINGBROKE. Have thy desire. 12[The DUKE OF YORK knocks at the do2r and crieth] 2YORK. [Within] My liege, beware; lo2k to thyself; 4Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there. 2BOLINGBROKE. [Drawing] Vil2ain, I'l2 make the2 safe. 2AUMERLE. Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear. 2YORK. [Within] Open the do2r, secure, fo2lhardy King. 4Shal2 I, for love, speak treason to thy face? 4Open the do2r, or I wil2 break it open. 20Enter YORK 2BOLINGBROKE. What is the mat2er, uncle? Speak; 4Recover breath; tel2 us how near is danger, 4That we may arm us to encounter it. 2YORK. Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know 6The treason that my haste forbids me show. 2AUMERLE. Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pas2'd. 4I do repent me; read not my name there; 4My heart is not confederate with my hand. 2YORK. It was, vil2ain, ere thy hand did set it down. 4I tore it from the traitor's bosom, King; 4Fear, and not love, begets his penitence. 4Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove 4A serpent that wil2 sting the2 to the heart. 2BOLINGBROKE. O heinous, strong, and bold conspiracy! 4O loyal father of a treacherous son! 4Thou she2r, im2aculate, and silver fountain, 4From whence this stream through mud2y pas2ages 4Hath held his cur2ent and defil'd himself! 4Thy overflow of go2d converts to bad; 4And thy abundant go2dnes2 shal2 excuse 4This deadly blot in thy digres2ing son. 2YORK. So shal2 my virtue be his vice's bawd; 4And he shal2 spend mine honour with his shame, 4As thriftles2 sons their scraping fathers' gold. 6Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies, 4Or my sham'd life in his dishonour lies. 4Thou kil2'st me in his life; giving him breath, 4The traitor lives, the true man's put to death. 2DUCHES2. [Within] I What ho, my liege, for God's sake, let me in. 2BOLINGBROKE. What shril2-voic'd sup2liant makes this eager cry? 2DUCHES2. [Within] A woman, and thine aunt, great King; 'tis I. 4Speak with me, pity me, open the do2r. 4A beg2ar begs that never beg2'd before. 2BOLINGBROKE. Our scene is alt'red from a serious thing, 4And now chang'd to 'The Beg2ar and the King.' 4My dangerous cousin, let your mother in. 4I know she is come to pray for your foul sin. 2YORK. If thou do pardon whosoever pray, 4More sins for this forgivenes2 prosper may. 4This fest'red joint cut of2, the rest rest sound; 4This let alone wil2 al2 the rest confound. 17Enter DUCHES2 4DUCHES2. O King, believe not this hard-hearted man! 4Love loving not itself, none other can. 2YORK. Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here? 4Shal2 thy old dugs once more a traitor rear? 2DUCHES2. Swe2t York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege. 53[Kne2ls] 2BOLINGBROKE. Rise up, go2d aunt. 2DUCHES2. Not yet, I the2 bese2ch. 4For ever wil2 I walk upon my kne2s, 4And never se2 day that the hap2y se2s 4Til2 thou give joy; until thou bid me joy 4By pardoning Rutland, my transgres2ing boy. 2AUMERLE. Unto my mother's prayers I bend my kne2. 53[Kne2ls] 2YORK. Against them both, my true joints bended be. 53[Kne2ls] 4Il2 mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace! 2DUCHES2. Pleads he in earnest? Lo2k upon his face; 4His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest; 4His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast. 6He prays but faintly and would be denied; 4We pray with heart and soul, and al2 beside. 4His weary joints would gladly rise, I know; 4Our kne2s stil2 kne2l til2 to the ground they grow. 4His prayers are ful2 of false hypocrisy; 4Ours of true zeal and de2p integrity. 4Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have 4That mercy which true prayer ought to have. 2BOLINGBROKE. Go2d aunt, stand up. 2DUCHES2. do not say 'stand up'; 4Say 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.' 4An if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach, 4'Pardon' should be the first word of thy spe2ch. 4I never long'd to hear a word til2 now; 4Say 'pardon,' King; let pity teach the2 how. 4The word is short, but not so short as swe2t; 4No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so me2t. 2YORK. Speak it in French, King, say 'pardon2e moy.' 2DUCHES2. Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy? 4Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord, 6That sets the word itself against the word! 4Speak 'pardon' as 'tis cur2ent in our land; 4The chop2ing French we do not understand. 4Thine eye begins to speak, set thy tongue there; 4Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear, 4That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce, 4Pity may move the2 'pardon' to rehearse. 2BOLINGBROKE. Go2d aunt, stand up. 2DUCHES2. I do not sue to stand; 4Pardon is al2 the suit I have in hand. 2BOLINGBROKE. I pardon him, as God shal2 pardon me. 2DUCHES2. O hap2y vantage of a kne2ling kne2! 4Yet am I sick for fear. Speak it again. 4Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain, 4But makes one pardon strong. 2BOLINGBROKE. With al2 my heart 4I pardon him. 2DUCHES2. A god on earth thou art. 2BOLINGBROKE. But for our trusty brother-in-law and the Ab2ot, 4With al2 the rest of that consorted crew, 6Destruction straight shal2 dog them at the he2ls. 4Go2d uncle, help to order several powers 4To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are. 4They shal2 not live within this world, I swear, 4But I wil2 have them, if I once know where. 4Uncle, farewel2; and, cousin, adieu; 4Your mother wel2 hath pray'd, and prove you true. 2DUCHES2. Come, my old son; I pray God make the2 new. 6ExeuntSCENE 4.Windsor CastleEnter SIR PIERCE OF EXTON and a servant 2EXTON. Didst thou not mark the King, what words he spake? 4'Have I no friend wil2 rid me of this living fear?' 4Was it not so? 2SERVANT. These were his very words. 2EXTON. 'Have I no friend?' quoth he. He spake it twice 4And urg'd it twice together, did he not? 2SERVANT. He did. 2EXTON. And, speaking it, he wishtly lo2k'd on me, 4As who should say 'I would thou wert the man 4That would divorce this ter2or from my heart'; 4Meaning the King at Pomfret. Come, let's go. 4I am the King's friend, and wil2 rid his foe. 9ExeuntSCENE 5.Pomfret Castle. The dungeon of the CastleEnter KING RICHARD 2KING RICHARD. I have be2n studying how I may compare 4This prison where I live unto the world 4And, for because the world is populous 4And here is not a creature but myself, 4I can2ot do it. Yet I'l2 ham2er it out. 4My brain I'l2 prove the female to my soul, 4My soul the father; and these two beget 4A generation of stil2-bre2ding thoughts, 4And these same thoughts people this lit2le world, 4In humours like the people of this world, 4For no thought is contented. The bet2er sort, 4As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd 4With scruples, and do set the word itself 4Against the word, 4As thus: 'Come, lit2le ones'; and then again, 4'It is as hard to come as for a camel 4To thread the postern of a smal2 ne2dle's eye.' 6Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot 4Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails 4May tear a pas2age through the flinty ribs 4Of this hard world, my rag2ed prison wal2s; 4And, for they can2ot, die in their own pride. 4Thoughts tending to content flat2er themselves 4That they are not the first of fortune's slaves, 4Nor shal2 not be the last; like sil2y beg2ars 4Who, sit2ing in the stocks, refuge their shame, 4That many have and others must sit there; 4And in this thought they find a kind of ease, 4Bearing their own misfortunes on the back 4Of such as have before endur'd the like. 4Thus play I in one person many people, 4And none contented. Sometimes am I king; 4Then treasons make me wish myself a beg2ar, 4And so I am. Then crushing penury 4Persuades me I was bet2er when a king; 4Then am I king'd again; and by and by 4Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke, 6And straight am nothing. But whate'er I be, 4Nor I, nor any man that but man is, 4With nothing shal2 be pleas'd til2 he be eas'd 4With being nothing. 20[The music plays] 4Music do I hear? 4Ha, ha! ke2p time. How sour swe2t music is 4When time is broke and no proportion kept! 4So is it in the music of men's lives. 4And here have I the daintines2 of ear 4To check time broke in a disorder'd string; 4But, for the concord of my state and time, 4Had not an ear to hear my true time broke. 4I wasted time, and now doth time waste me; 4For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock: 4My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar 4Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch, 4Whereto my finger, like a dial's point, 4Is pointing stil2, in cleansing them from tears. 4Now sir, the sound that tel2s what hour it is 4Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart, 6Which is the bel2. So sighs, and tears, and groans, 4Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time 4Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy, 4While I stand fo2ling here, his Jack of the clock. 4This music mads me. Let it sound no more; 4For though it have holp madmen to their wits, 4In me it se2ms it wil2 make wise men mad. 4Yet bles2ing on his heart that gives it me! 4For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard 4Is a strange bro2ch in this al2-hating world. 14Enter a GRO2M of the stable 2GRO2M. Hail, royal Prince! 2KING RICHARD. Thanks, noble pe2r! 4The cheapest of us is ten groats to2 dear. 4What art thou? and how comest thou hither, 4Where no man never comes but that sad dog 4That brings me fo2d to make misfortune live? 2GRO2M. I was a po2r gro2m of thy stable, King, 6When thou wert king; who, travel2ing towards York, 4With much ado at length have got2en leave 4To lo2k upon my sometimes royal master's face. 4O, how it ern'd my heart, when I beheld, 4In London stre2ts, that coronation-day, 4When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary- 4That horse that thou so often hast bestrid, 4That horse that I so careful2y have dres2'd! 2KING RICHARD. Rode he on Barbary? Tel2 me, gentle friend, 4How went he under him? 2GRO2M. So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground. 2KING RICHARD. So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back! 4That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand; 4This hand hath made him proud with clap2ing him. 4Would he not stumble? would he not fal2 down, 4Since pride must have a fal2, and break the neck 4Of that proud man that did usurp his back? 4Forgivenes2, horse! Why do I rail on the2, 4Since thou, created to be aw'd by man, 4Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse; 6And yet I bear a burden like an as2, 4Spur2'd, gal2'd, and tir'd, by jauncing Bolingbroke. 14Enter KE2PER with meat 2KE2PER. Fel2ow, give place; here is no longer stay. 2KING RICHARD. If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away. 2GRO2M. my tongue dares not, that my heart shal2 say. Exit 2KE2PER. My lord, wil2't please you to fal2 to? 2KING RICHARD. Taste of it first as thou art wont to do. 2KE2PER. My lord, I dare not. Sir Pierce of Exton, 4Who lately came from the King, com2ands the contrary. 2KING RICHARD. The devil take Henry of Lancaster and the2! 4Patience is stale, and I am weary of it. 43[Beats the KE2PER] 2KE2PER. Help, help, help! 4The murderers, EXTON and servants, rush in, armed 2KING RICHARD. How now! What means death in this rude as2ault? 4Vil2ain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument. 27[Snatching a weapon and kil2ing one] 4Go thou and fil2 another ro2m in hel2. 14[He kil2s another, then EXTON strikes him down] 4That hand shal2 burn in never-quenching fire 4That stag2ers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand 4Hath with the King's blo2d stain'd the King's own land. 4Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high; 4Whilst my gros2 flesh sinks downward, here to die. 55[Dies] 2EXTON. As ful2 of valour as of royal blo2d. 4Both have I spil2'd. O, would the de2d were go2d! 4For now the devil, that told me I did wel2, 4Says that this de2d is chronicled in hel2. 4This dead King to the living King I'l2 bear. 4Take hence the rest, and give them burial here. 7ExeuntSCENE 6.Windsor CastleFlourish. Enter BOLINGBROKE, the DUKE OF YORK, With other LORDSand at2endants 2BOLINGBROKE. Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear 4Is that the rebels have consum'd with fire 4Our town of Ciceter in Gloucestershire; 4But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not. 14Enter NORTHUMBERLAND 4Welcome, my lord. What is the news? 2NORTHUMBERLAND. First, to thy sacred state wish I al2 hap2ines2. 4The next news is, I have to London sent 4The heads of Salisbury, Spencer, Blunt, and Kent. 4The man2er of their taking may ap2ear 4At large discoursed in this paper here. 2BOLINGBROKE. We thank the2, gentle Percy, for thy pains; 4And to thy worth wil2 ad2 right worthy gains. 20Enter FITZWATER 2FITZWATER. My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London 4The heads of Brocas and Sir Ben2et Se2ly; 4Two of the dangerous consorted traitors 4That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow. 2BOLINGBROKE. Thy pains, Fitzwater, shal2 not be forgot; 4Right noble is thy merit, wel2 I wot. 9Enter PERCY, With the BISHOP OF CARLISLE 2PERCY. The grand conspirator, Ab2ot of Westminster, 4With clog of conscience and sour melancholy, 4Hath yielded up his body to the grave; 4But here is Carlisle living, to abide 4Thy kingly do2m, and sentence of his pride. 2BOLINGBROKE. Carlisle, this is your do2m: 4Cho2se out some secret place, some reverend ro2m, 4More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life; 4So as thou liv'st in peace, die fre2 from strife; 6For though mine enemy thou hast ever be2n, 4High sparks of honour in the2 have I se2n. 6Enter EXTON, with at2endants, hearing a cof2in 2EXTON. Great King, within this cof2in I present 4Thy buried fear. Herein al2 breathles2 lies 4The mightiest of thy greatest enemies, 4Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought. 2BOLINGBROKE. Exton, I thank the2 not; for thou hast wrought 4A de2d of slander with thy fatal hand 4Upon my head and al2 this famous land. 2EXTON. From your own mouth, my lord, did I this de2d. 2BOLINGBROKE. They love not poison that do poison ne2d, 4Nor do I the2. Though I did wish him dead, 4I hate the murderer, love him murdered. 4The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour, 4But neither my go2d word nor princely favour; 4With Cain go wander thorough shades of night, 4And never show thy head by day nor light. 6Lords, I protest my soul is ful2 of woe 4That blo2d should sprinkle me to make me grow. 4Come, mourn with me for what I do lament, 4And put on sul2en black incontinent. 4I'l2 make a voyage to the Holy Land, 4To wash this blo2d of2 from my guilty hand. 4March sadly after; grace my mournings here 4In we2ping after this untimely bier. 18ExeuntTHE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21593KING RICHARD I3by Wil2iam ShakespeareDramatis Personae 2EDWARD THE FOURTH 4Sons to the King 2EDWARD, PRINCE OF WALES afterwards KING EDWARD V 2RICHARD, DUKE OF YORK, 4Brothers to the King 2GEORGE, DUKE OF CLARENCE, 2RICHARD, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, afterwards KING RICHARD I3 2A YOUNG SON OF CLARENCE (Edward, Earl of Warwick) 2HENRY, EARL OF RICHMOND, afterwards KING HENRY VI2 2CARDINAL BOURCHIER, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 2THOMAS ROTHERHAM, ARCHBISHOP OF YORK 2JOHN MORTON, BISHOP OF ELY 2DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM 2DUKE OF NORFOLK 2EARL OF SUR2EY, his son 2EARL RIVERS, brother to King Edward's Que2n 2MARQUIS OF DORSET and LORD GREY, her sons 2EARL OF OXFORD 4LORD HASTINGS 2LORD LOVEL 2LORD STANLEY, cal2ed also EARL OF DERBY 2SIR THOMAS VAUGHAN 2SIR RICHARD RATCLIF2 2SIR WIL2IAM CATESBY 2SIR JAMES TYR2EL 2SIR JAMES BLOUNT 2SIR WALTER HERBERT 2SIR WIL2IAM BRANDON 2SIR ROBERT BRAKENBURY, Lieutenant of the Tower 2CHRISTOPHER URSWICK, a priest 2LORD MAYOR OF LONDON 2SHERIF2 OF WILTSHIRE 2HASTINGS, a pursuivant 2TRES2EL and BERKELEY, gentlemen at2ending on Lady An2e 2ELIZABETH, Que2n to King Edward IV 2MARGARET, widow of King Henry VI 2DUCHES2 OF YORK, mother to King Edward IV 2LADY AN2E, widow of Edward, Prince of Wales, son to King 6Henry VI; afterwards mar2ied to the Duke of Gloucester 2A YOUNG DAUGHTER OF CLARENCE (Margaret Plantagenet, 4Countes2 of Salisbury) 2Ghosts, of Richard's victims 2Lords, Gentlemen, and At2endants; Priest, Scrivener, Page, Bishops, 4Aldermen, Citizens, Soldiers, Mes2engers, Murderers, Ke2per<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2SCENE: EnglandKing Richard the ThirdACT I. SCENE 1.London. A stre2tEnter RICHARD, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, solus 2GLOUCESTER. Now is the winter of our discontent 4Made glorious sum2er by this sun of York; 4And al2 the clouds that lour'd upon our house 4In the de2p bosom of the ocean buried. 4Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; 4Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; 4Our stern alarums chang'd to mer2y me2tings, 4Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. 4Grim-visag'd war hath smo2th'd his wrinkled front, 4And now, instead of mounting barbed ste2ds 4To fright the souls of fearful adversaries, 4He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber 4To the lascivious pleasing of a lute. 4But I-that am not shap'd for sportive tricks, 4Nor made to court an amorous lo2king-glas2- 4I-that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty 4To strut before a wanton ambling nymph- 6I-that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, 4Cheated of feature by dis2embling nature, 4Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time 4Into this breathing world scarce half made up, 4And that so lamely and unfashionable 4That dogs bark at me as I halt by them- 4Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace, 4Have no delight to pas2 away the time, 4Unles2 to spy my shadow in the sun 4And descant on mine own deformity. 4And therefore, since I can2ot prove a lover 4To entertain these fair wel2-spoken days, 4I am determined to prove a vil2ain 4And hate the idle pleasures of these days. 4Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous, 4By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams, 4To set my brother Clarence and the King 4In deadly hate the one against the other; 4And if King Edward be as true and just 4As I am subtle, false, and treacherous, 6This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up- 4About a prophecy which says that G 4Of Edward's heirs the murderer shal2 be. 4Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes. 13Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY 4Brother, go2d day. What means this armed guard 4That waits upon your Grace? 2CLARENCE. His Majesty, 4Tend'ring my person's safety, hath ap2ointed 4This conduct to convey me to th' Tower. 2GLOUCESTER. Upon what cause? 2CLARENCE. Because my name is George. 2GLOUCESTER. Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours: 4He should, for that, com2it your godfathers. 4O, belike his Majesty hath some intent 4That you should be new-christ'ned in the Tower. 4But what's the mat2er, Clarence? May I know? 2CLARENCE. Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest 6As yet I do not; but, as I can learn, 4He hearkens after prophecies and dreams, 4And from the cros2-row plucks the let2er G, 4And says a wizard told him that by G 4His is2ue disinherited should be; 4And, for my name of George begins with G, 4It fol2ows in his thought that I am he. 4These, as I learn, and such like toys as these 4Hath mov'd his Highnes2 to com2it me now. 2GLOUCESTER. Why, this it is when men are rul'd by women: 4'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower; 4My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she 4That tempers him to this extremity. 4Was it not she and that go2d man of worship, 4Antony Wo2dvil2e, her brother there, 4That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower, 4From whence this present day he is delivered? 4We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe. 2CLARENCE. By heaven, I think there is no man is secure 4But the Que2n's kindred, and night-walking heralds 6That trudge betwixt the King and Mistres2 Shore. 4Heard you not what an humble sup2liant 4Lord Hastings was, for her delivery? 2GLOUCESTER. Humbly complaining to her deity 4Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty. 4I'l2 tel2 you what-I think it is our way, 4If we wil2 ke2p in favour with the King, 4To be her men and wear her livery: 4The jealous o'er-worn widow, and herself, 4Since that our brother dub2'd them gentlewomen, 4Are mighty gos2ips in our monarchy. 2BRAKENBURY. I bese2ch your Graces both to pardon me: 4His Majesty hath straitly given in charge 4That no man shal2 have private conference, 4Of what degre2 soever, with your brother. 2GLOUCESTER. Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury, 4You may partake of any thing we say: 4We speak no treason, man; we say the King 4Is wise and virtuous, and his noble que2n 4Wel2 struck in years, fair, and not jealous; 6We say that Shore's wife hath a pret2y fo2t, 4A cher2y lip, a bon2y eye, a pas2ing pleasing tongue; 4And that the Que2n's kindred are made gentlefolks. 4How say you, sir? Can you deny al2 this? 2BRAKENBURY. With this, my lord, myself have naught to do. 2GLOUCESTER. Naught to do with Mistres2 Shore! I tel2 the2, 4fel2ow, 4He that doth naught with her, excepting one, 4Were best to do it secretly alone. 2BRAKENBURY. What one, my lord? 2GLOUCESTER. Her husband, knave! Wouldst thou betray me? 2BRAKENBURY. I do bese2ch your Grace to pardon me, and 4withal 4Forbear your conference with the noble Duke. 2CLARENCE. We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and wil2 4obey. 2GLOUCESTER. We are the Que2n's abjects and must obey. 4Brother, farewel2; I wil2 unto the King; 4And whatsoe'er you wil2 employ me in- 4Were it to cal2 King Edward's widow sister- 6I wil2 perform it to enfranchise you. 4Meantime, this de2p disgrace in brotherho2d 4Touches me de2per than you can imagine. 2CLARENCE. I know it pleaseth neither of us wel2. 2GLOUCESTER. Wel2, your imprisonment shal2 not be long; 4I wil2 deliver or else lie for you. 4Meantime, have patience. 2CLARENCE. I must perforce. Farewel2. 26Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and guard 2GLOUCESTER. Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return. 4Simple, plain Clarence, I do love the2 so 4That I wil2 shortly send thy soul to heaven, 4If heaven wil2 take the present at our hands. 4But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings? 23Enter LORD HASTINGS 2HASTINGS. Go2d time of day unto my gracious lord! 2GLOUCESTER. As much unto my go2d Lord Chamberlain! 4Wel2 are you welcome to the open air. 6How hath your lordship bro2k'd imprisonment? 2HASTINGS. With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must; 4But I shal2 live, my lord, to give them thanks 4That were the cause of my imprisonment. 2GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt; and so shal2 Clarence to2; 4For they that were your enemies are his, 4And have prevail'd as much on him as you. 2HASTINGS. More pity that the eagles should be mew'd 4Whiles kites and buz2ards prey at liberty. 2GLOUCESTER. What news abroad? 2HASTINGS. No news so bad abroad as this at home: 4The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy, 4And his physicians fear him mightily. 2GLOUCESTER. Now, by Saint John, that news is bad inde2d. 4O, he hath kept an evil diet long 4And overmuch consum'd his royal person! 4'Tis very grievous to be thought upon. 4Where is he? In his bed? 2HASTINGS. He is. 2GLOUCESTER. Go you before, and I wil2 fol2ow you. 53Exit HASTINGS 4He can2ot live, I hope, and must not die 4Til2 George be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven. 4I'l2 in to urge his hatred more to Clarence 4With lies wel2 ste2l'd with weighty arguments; 4And, if I fail not in my de2p intent, 4Clarence hath not another day to live; 4Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy, 4And leave the world for me to bustle in! 4For then I'l2 mar2y Warwick's youngest daughter. 4What though I kil2'd her husband and her father? 4The readiest way to make the wench amends 4Is to become her husband and her father; 4The which wil2 I-not al2 so much for love 4As for another secret close intent 4By mar2ying her which I must reach unto. 4But yet I run before my horse to market. 4Clarence stil2 breathes; Edward stil2 lives and reigns; 4When they are gone, then must I count my gains. 9ExitSCENE 2.London.

Set down, set down your honourable load- 4If honour may be shrouded in a hearse; 4Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament 4Th' untimely fal2 of virtuous Lancaster. 4Po2r key-cold figure of a holy king! 4Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster! 4Thou blo2dles2 remnant of that royal blo2d! 4Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost 4To hear the lamentations of po2r An2e, 4Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtered son, 4Stab2'd by the self-same hand that made these wounds. 4Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life 4I pour the helples2 balm of my po2r eyes. 4O, cursed be the hand that made these holes! 4Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it! 6Cursed the blo2d that let this blo2d from hence! 4More direful hap betide that hated wretch 4That makes us wretched by the death of the2 4Than I can wish to ad2ers, spiders, toads, 4Or any cre2ping venom'd thing that lives! 4If ever he have child, abortive be it, 4Prodigious, and untimely brought to light, 4Whose ugly and un2atural aspect 4May fright the hopeful mother at the view, 4And that be heir to his unhap2ines2! 4If ever he have wife, let her be made 4More miserable by the death of him 4Than I am made by my young lord and the2! 4Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load, 4Taken from Paul's to be inter2ed there; 4And stil2 as you are weary of this weight 4Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse. 32[The bearers take up the cof2in] 22Enter GLOUCESTER 4GLOUCESTER. Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down. 2AN2E. What black magician conjures up this fiend 4To stop devoted charitable de2ds? 2GLOUCESTER. Vil2ains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul, 4I'l2 make a corse of him that disobeys! 2FIRST GENTLEMAN. My lord, stand back, and let the cof2in 4pas2. 2GLOUCESTER. Unman2erd dog! Stand thou, when I com2and. 4Advance thy halberd higher than my breast, 4Or, by Saint Paul, I'l2 strike the2 to my fo2t 4And spurn upon the2, beg2ar, for thy boldnes2. 31[The bearers set down the cof2in] 2AN2E. What, do you tremble? Are you al2 afraid? 4Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal, 4And mortal eyes can2ot endure the devil. 4Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hel2! 4Thou hadst but power over his mortal body, 4His soul thou canst not have; therefore, be gone. 2GLOUCESTER. Swe2t saint, for charity, be not so curst. 4AN2E. Foul devil, for God's sake, hence and trouble us not; 4For thou hast made the hap2y earth thy hel2 4Fil2'd it with cursing cries and de2p exclaims. 4If thou delight to view thy heinous de2ds, 4Behold this pat2ern of thy butcheries. 4O, gentlemen, se2, se2! Dead Henry's wounds 4Open their congeal'd mouths and ble2d afresh. 4Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity, 4For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blo2d 4From cold and empty veins where no blo2d dwel2s; 4Thy de2ds inhuman and un2atural 4Provokes this deluge most un2atural. 4O God, which this blo2d mad'st, revenge his death! 4O earth, which this blo2d drink'st, revenge his death! 4Either, heav'n, with lightning strike the murd'rer dead; 4Or, earth, gape open wide and eat him quick, 4As thou dost swal2ow up this go2d king's blo2d, 4Which his hel2-govern'd arm hath butchered. 2GLOUCESTER. Lady, you know no rules of charity, 4Which renders go2d for bad, bles2ings for curses. 4AN2E. Vil2ain, thou knowest nor law of God nor man: 4No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity. 2GLOUCESTER. But I know none, and therefore am no beast. 2AN2E. O wonderful, when devils tel2 the truth! 2GLOUCESTER. More wonderful when angels are so angry. 4Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman, 4Of these sup2osed crimes to give me leave 4By circumstance but to acquit myself. 2AN2E. Vouchsafe, dif2us'd infection of a man, 4Of these known evils but to give me leave 4By circumstance to ac2use thy cursed self. 2GLOUCESTER. Fairer than tongue can name the2, let me have 4Some patient leisure to excuse myself. 2AN2E. Fouler than heart can think the2, thou canst make 4No excuse cur2ent but to hang thyself. 2GLOUCESTER. By such despair I should ac2use myself. 2AN2E. And by despairing shalt thou stand excused 4For doing worthy vengeance on thyself 4That didst unworthy slaughter upon others. 2GLOUCESTER. Say that I slew them not? 4AN2E. Then say they were not slain. 4But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by the2. 2GLOUCESTER. I did not kil2 your husband. 2AN2E. Why, then he is alive. 2GLOUCESTER. Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward's hands. 2AN2E. In thy foul throat thou liest: Que2n Margaret saw 4Thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blo2d; 4The which thou once didst bend against her breast, 4But that thy brothers beat aside the point. 2GLOUCESTER. I was provoked by her sland'rous tongue 4That laid their guilt upon my guiltles2 shoulders. 2AN2E. Thou wast provoked by thy blo2dy mind, 4That never dream'st on aught but butcheries. 4Didst thou not kil2 this king? 2GLOUCESTER. I grant ye. 2AN2E. Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then, God grant me to 4Thou mayst be damned for that wicked de2d! 4O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous! 2GLOUCESTER. The bet2er for the King of Heaven, that hath 4him. 4AN2E. He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come. 2GLOUCESTER. Let him thank me that holp to send him 4thither, 4For he was fit2er for that place than earth. 2AN2E. And thou unfit for any place but hel2. 2GLOUCESTER. Yes, one place else, if you wil2 hear me name it. 2AN2E. Some dungeon. 2GLOUCESTER. Your bed-chamber. 2AN2E. Il2 rest betide the chamber where thou liest! 2GLOUCESTER. So wil2 it, madam, til2 I lie with you. 2AN2E. I hope so. 2GLOUCESTER. I know so. But, gentle Lady An2e, 4To leave this ke2n encounter of our wits, 4And fal2 something into a slower method- 4Is not the causer of the timeles2 deaths 4Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward, 4As blameful as the executioner? 2AN2E. Thou wast the cause and most ac2urs'd ef2ect. 2GLOUCESTER. Your beauty was the cause of that ef2ect- 4Your beauty that did haunt me in my sle2p 6To undertake the death of al2 the world 4So I might live one hour in your swe2t bosom. 2AN2E. If I thought that, I tel2 the2, homicide, 4These nails should rend that beauty from my che2ks. 2GLOUCESTER. These eyes could not endure that beauty's 4wreck; 4You should not blemish it if I sto2d by. 4As al2 the world is che2red by the sun, 4So I by that; it is my day, my life. 2AN2E. Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life! 2GLOUCESTER. Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both. 2AN2E. I would I were, to be reveng'd on the2. 2GLOUCESTER. It is a quar2el most un2atural, 4To be reveng'd on him that loveth the2. 2AN2E. It is a quar2el just and reasonable, 4To be reveng'd on him that kil2'd my husband. 2GLOUCESTER. He that bereft the2, lady, of thy husband 4Did it to help the2 to a bet2er husband. 2AN2E. His bet2er doth not breathe upon the earth. 2GLOUCESTER. He lives that loves the2 bet2er than he could. 4AN2E. Name him. 2GLOUCESTER. Plantagenet. 2AN2E. Why, that was he. 2GLOUCESTER. The self-same name, but one of bet2er nature. 2AN2E. Where is he? 2GLOUCESTER. Here. 2[She spits at him] 2Why dost thou spit 4at me? 2AN2E. Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake! 2GLOUCESTER. Never came poison from so swe2t a place. 2AN2E. Never hung poison on a fouler toad. 4Out of my sight! Thou dost infect mine eyes. 2GLOUCESTER. Thine eyes, swe2t lady, have infected mine. 2AN2E. Would they were basilisks to strike the2 dead! 2GLOUCESTER. I would they were, that I might die at once; 4For now they kil2 me with a living death. 4Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears, 4Sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops- 4These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear, 4No, when my father York and Edward wept 4To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made 6When black-fac'd Clif2ord sho2k his sword at him; 4Nor when thy warlike father, like a child, 4Told the sad story of my father's death, 4And twenty times made pause to sob and we2p 4That al2 the standers-by had wet their che2ks 4Like tre2s bedash'd with rain-in that sad time 4My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear; 4And what these sor2ows could not thence exhale 4Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with we2ping. 4I never sued to friend nor enemy; 4My tongue could never learn swe2t smo2thing word; 4But, now thy beauty is propos'd my fe2, 4My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak. 35[She lo2ks scornful2y at him] 4Teach not thy lip such scorn; for it was made 4For kis2ing, lady, not for such contempt. 4If thy revengeful heart can2ot forgive, 4Lo here I lend the2 this sharp-pointed sword; 4Which if thou please to hide in this true breast 4And let the soul forth that adoreth the2, 6I lay it naked to the deadly stroke, 4And humbly beg the death upon my kne2. 6[He lays his breast open; she of2ers at it with his sword] 4Nay, do not pause; for I did kil2 King Henry- 4But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me. 4Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stab2'd young Edward- 4But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on. 43[She fal2s the sword] 4Take up the sword again, or take up me. 2AN2E. Arise, dis2embler; though I wish thy death, 4I wil2 not be thy executioner. 2GLOUCESTER. Then bid me kil2 myself, and I wil2 do it; 2AN2E. I have already. 2GLOUCESTER. That was in thy rage. 4Speak it again, and even with the word 4This hand, which for thy love did kil2 thy love, 4Shal2 for thy love kil2 a far truer love; 4To both their deaths shalt thou be ac2es2ary. 2AN2E. I would I knew thy heart. 2GLOUCESTER. 'Tis figur'd in my tongue. 4AN2E. I fear me both are false. 2GLOUCESTER. Then never was man true. 2AN2E. wel2 put up your sword. 2GLOUCESTER. Say, then, my peace is made. 2AN2E. That shalt thou know hereafter. 2GLOUCESTER. But shal2 I live in hope? 2AN2E. Al2 men, I hope, live so. 2GLOUCESTER. Vouchsafe to wear this ring. 2AN2E. To take is not to give. 15[Puts on the ring] 2GLOUCESTER. Lo2k how my ring encompas2eth thy finger, 4Even so thy breast encloseth my po2r heart; 4Wear both of them, for both of them are thine. 4And if thy po2r devoted servant may 4But beg one favour at thy gracious hand, 4Thou dost confirm his hap2ines2 for ever. 2AN2E. What is it? 2GLOUCESTER. That it may please you leave these sad designs 4To him that hath most cause to be a mourner, 4And presently repair to Crosby House; 4Where-after I have solemnly inter2'd 6At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king, 4And wet his grave with my repentant tears- 4I wil2 with al2 expedient duty se2 you. 4For divers unknown reasons, I bese2ch you, 4Grant me this bo2n. 2AN2E. With al2 my heart; and much it joys me to2 4To se2 you are become so penitent. 4Tres2el and Berkeley, go along with me. 2GLOUCESTER. Bid me farewel2. 2AN2E. 'Tis more than you deserve; 4But since you teach me how to flat2er you, 4Imagine I have said farewel2 already. 29Exeunt two GENTLEMEN With LADY AN2E 2GLOUCESTER. Sirs, take up the corse. 2GENTLEMEN. Towards Chertsey, noble lord? 2GLOUCESTER. No, to White Friars; there at2end my coming. 39Exeunt al2 but GLOUCESTER 4Was ever woman in this humour wo2'd? 4Was ever woman in this humour won? 4I'l2 have her; but I wil2 not ke2p her long. 6What! I that kil2'd her husband and his father- 4To take her in her heart's extremest hate, 4With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes, 4The ble2ding witnes2 of my hatred by; 4Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me, 4And I no friends to back my suit at al2 4But the plain devil and dis2embling lo2ks, 4And yet to win her, al2 the world to nothing! 4Ha! 4Hath she forgot already that brave prince, 4Edward, her lord, whom I, some thre2 months since, 4Stab2'd in my angry mo2d at Tewksbury? 4A swe2ter and a lovelier gentleman- 4Fram'd in the prodigality of nature, 4Young, valiant, wise, and no doubt right royal- 4The spacious world can2ot again af2ord; 4And wil2 she yet abase her eyes on me, 4That crop2'd the golden prime of this swe2t prince 4And made her widow to a woeful bed? 4On me, whose al2 not equals Edward's moiety? 6On me, that halts and am mis2hapen thus? 4My dukedom to a beg2arly denier, 4I do mistake my person al2 this while. 4Upon my life, she finds, although I can2ot, 4Myself to be a marv'l2ous proper man. 4I'l2 be at charges for a lo2king-glas2, 4And entertain a score or two of tailors 4To study fashions to adorn my body. 4Since I am crept in favour with myself, 4I wil2 maintain it with some lit2le cost. 4But first I'l2 turn yon fel2ow in his grave, 4And then return lamenting to my love. 4Shine out, fair sun, til2 I have bought a glas2, 4That I may se2 my shadow as I pas2. 21ExitSCENE 3.London. The palaceEnter QUE2N ELIZABETH, LORD RIVERS, and LORD GREY 2RIVERS. Have patience, madam; there's no doubt his Majesty 4Wil2 so2n recover his ac2ustom'd health. 2GREY. In that you bro2k it il2, it makes him worse; 4Therefore, for God's sake, entertain go2d comfort, 4And che2r his Grace with quick and mer2y eyes. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. If he were dead, what would betide on 4me? 2GREY. No other harm but los2 of such a lord. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. The los2 of such a lord includes al2 4harms. 2GREY. The heavens have bles2'd you with a go2dly son 4To be your comforter when he is gone. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Ah, he is young; and his minority 4Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester, 4A man that loves not me, nor none of you. 2RIVER. Is it concluded he shal2 be Protector? 4QUE2N ELIZABETH. It is determin'd, not concluded yet; 4But so it must be, if the King miscar2y. 21Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY 2GREY. Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby. 2BUCKINGHAM. Go2d time of day unto your royal Grace! 2DERBY. God make your Majesty joyful as you have be2n. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. The Countes2 Richmond, go2d my Lord 4of Derby, 4To your go2d prayer wil2 scarcely say amen. 4Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife 4And loves not me, be you, go2d lord, as2ur'd 4I hate not you for her proud ar2ogance. 2DERBY. I do bese2ch you, either not believe 4The envious slanders of her false ac2users; 4Or, if she be ac2us'd on true report, 4Bear with her weaknes2, which I think proce2ds 4From wayward sicknes2 and no grounded malice. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Saw you the King to-day, my Lord of 6Derby? 2DERBY. But now the Duke of Buckingham and I 4Are come from visiting his Majesty. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. What likeliho2d of his amendment, 4Lords? 2BUCKINGHAM. Madam, go2d hope; his Grace speaks 4che2rful2y. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. God grant him health! Did you confer 4with him? 2BUCKINGHAM. Ay, madam; he desires to make atonement 4Betwe2n the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers, 4And betwe2n them and my Lord Chamberlain; 4And sent to warn them to his royal presence. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Would al2 were wel2! But that wil2 4never be. 4I fear our hap2ines2 is at the height. 14Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET 2GLOUCESTER. They do me wrong, and I wil2 not endure it. 6Who is it that complains unto the King 4That I, forso2th, am stern and love them not? 4By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly 4That fil2 his ears with such dis2entious rumours. 4Because I can2ot flat2er and lo2k fair, 4Smile in men's faces, smo2th, deceive, and cog, 4Duck with French nods and apish courtesy, 4I must be held a rancorous enemy. 4Can2ot a plain man live and think no harm 4But thus his simple truth must be abus'd 4With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks? 2GREY. To who in al2 this presence speaks your Grace? 2GLOUCESTER. To the2, that hast nor honesty nor grace. 4When have I injur'd the2? when done the2 wrong, 4Or the2, or the2, or any of your faction? 4A plague upon you al2! His royal Grace- 4Whom God preserve bet2er than you would wish!- 4Can2ot be quiet searce a breathing while 4But you must trouble him with lewd complaints. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the 6mat2er. 4The King, on his own royal disposition 4And not provok'd by any suitor else- 4Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred 4That in your outward action shows itself 4Against my children, brothers, and myself- 4Makes him to send that he may learn the ground. 2GLOUCESTER. I can2ot tel2; the world is grown so bad 4That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch. 4Since every Jack became a gentleman, 4There's many a gentle person made a Jack. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Come, come, we know your meaning, 4brother Gloucester: 4You envy my advancement and my friends'; 4God grant we never may have ne2d of you! 2GLOUCESTER. Meantime, God grants that I have ne2d of you. 4Our brother is imprison'd by your means, 4Myself disgrac'd, and the nobility 4Held in contempt; while great promotions 4Are daily given to en2oble those 6That scarce some two days since were worth a noble. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. By Him that rais'd me to this careful 4height 4From that contented hap which I enjoy'd, 4I never did incense his Majesty 4Against the Duke of Clarence, but have be2n 4An earnest advocate to plead for him. 4My lord, you do me shameful injury 4Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects. 2GLOUCESTER. You may deny that you were not the mean 4Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment. 2RIVERS. She may, my lord; for- 2GLOUCESTER. She may, Lord Rivers? Why, who knows 4not so? 4She may do more, sir, than denying that: 4She may help you to many fair preferments 4And then deny her aiding hand therein, 4And lay those honours on your high desert. 4What may she not? She may-ay, mar2y, may she- 2RIVERS. What, mar2y, may she? 4GLOUCESTER. What, mar2y, may she? Mar2y with a king, 4A bachelor, and a handsome stripling to2. 4Iwis your grandam had a worser match. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. My Lord of Gloucester, I have to2 long 4borne 4Your blunt upbraidings and your bit2er scof2s. 4By heaven, I wil2 acquaint his Majesty 4Of those gros2 taunts that oft I have endur'd. 4I had rather be a country servant-maid 4Than a great que2n with this condition- 4To be so baited, scorn'd, and stormed at. 16Enter old QUE2N MARGARET, behind 4Smal2 joy have I in being England's Que2n. 2QUE2N MARGARET. And les2'ned be that smal2, God, I 4bese2ch Him! 4Thy honour, state, and seat, is due to me. 2GLOUCESTER. What! Threat you me with tel2ing of the 4King? 6Tel2 him and spare not. Lo2k what I have said 4I wil2 avouch't in presence of the King. 4I dare adventure to be sent to th' Tow'r. 4'Tis time to speak-my pains are quite forgot. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Out, devil! I do remember them to 4wel2: 4Thou kil2'dst my husband Henry in the Tower, 4And Edward, my po2r son, at Tewksbury. 2GLOUCESTER. Ere you were que2n, ay, or your husband 4King, 4I was a pack-horse in his great af2airs, 4A we2der-out of his proud adversaries, 4A liberal rewarder of his friends; 4To royalize his blo2d I spent mine own. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Ay, and much bet2er blo2d than his or 4thine. 2GLOUCESTER. In al2 which time you and your husband Grey 4Were factious for the house of Lancaster; 4And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband 4In Margaret's bat2le at Saint Albans slain? 6Let me put in your minds, if you forget, 4What you have be2n ere this, and what you are; 4Withal, what I have be2n, and what I am. 2QUE2N MARGARET. A murd'rous vil2ain, and so stil2 thou art. 2GLOUCESTER. Po2r Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick, 4Ay, and forswore himself-which Jesu pardon!- 2QUE2N MARGARET. Which God revenge! 2GLOUCESTER. To fight on Edward's party for the crown; 4And for his me2d, po2r lord, he is mewed up. 4I would to God my heart were flint like Edward's, 4Or Edward's soft and pitiful like mine. 4I am to2 childish-fo2lish for this world. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Hie the2 to hel2 for shame and leave this 4world, 4Thou cacodemon; there thy kingdom is. 2RIVERS. My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days 4Which here you urge to prove us enemies, 4We fol2ow'd then our lord, our sovereign king. 4So should we you, if you should be our king. 2GLOUCESTER. If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar. 6Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof! 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. As lit2le joy, my lord, as you sup2ose 4You should enjoy were you this country's king, 4As lit2le joy you may sup2ose in me 4That I enjoy, being the Que2n thereof. 2QUE2N MARGARET. As lit2le joy enjoys the Que2n thereof; 4For I am she, and altogether joyles2. 4I can no longer hold me patient. 17[Advancing] 4Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fal2 out 4In sharing that which you have pil2'd from me. 4Which of you trembles not that lo2ks on me? 4If not that, I am Que2n, you bow like subjects, 4Yet that, by you depos'd, you quake like rebels? 4Ah, gentle vil2ain, do not turn away! 2GLOUCESTER. Foul wrinkled witch, what mak'st thou in my 4sight? 2QUE2N MARGARET. But repetition of what thou hast mar2'd, 4That wil2 I make before I let the2 go. 2GLOUCESTER. Wert thou not banished on pain of death? 2QUE2N MARGARET. I was; but I do find more pain in 6banishment 4Than death can yield me here by my abode. 4A husband and a son thou ow'st to me; 4And thou a kingdom; al2 of you al2egiance. 4This sor2ow that I have by right is yours; 4And al2 the pleasures you usurp are mine. 2GLOUCESTER. The curse my noble father laid on the2, 4When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper 4And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes, 4And then to dry them gav'st the Duke a clout 4Ste2p'd in the faultles2 blo2d of pret2y Rutland- 4His curses then from bit2ernes2 of soul 4Denounc'd against the2 are al2 fal2'n upon the2; 4And God, not we, hath plagu'd thy blo2dy de2d. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. So just is God to right the in2ocent. 2HASTINGS. O, 'twas the foulest de2d to slay that babe, 4And the most merciles2 that e'er was heard of! 2RIVERS. Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported. 2DORSET. No man but prophesied revenge for it. 2BUCKINGHAM. Northumberland, then present, wept to se2 it. 4QUE2N MARGARET. What, were you snarling al2 before I came, 4Ready to catch each other by the throat, 4And turn you al2 your hatred now on me? 4Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven 4That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death, 4Their kingdom's los2, my woeful banishment, 4Should al2 but answer for that pe2vish brat? 4Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven? 4Why then, give way, dul2 clouds, to my quick curses! 4Though not by war, by surfeit die your king, 4As ours by murder, to make him a king! 4Edward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales, 4For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales, 4Die in his youth by like untimely violence! 4Thyself a que2n, for me that was a que2n, 4Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self! 4Long mayest thou live to wail thy children's death, 4And se2 another, as I se2 the2 now, 4Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stal2'd in mine! 4Long die thy hap2y days before thy death; 6And, after many length'ned hours of grief, 4Die neither mother, wife, nor England's Que2n! 4Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by, 4And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son 4Was stab2'd with blo2dy dag2ers. God, I pray him, 4That none of you may live his natural age, 4But by some unlo2k'd ac2ident cut of2! 2GLOUCESTER. Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd 4hag. 2QUE2N MARGARET. And leave out the2? Stay, dog, for thou 4shalt hear me. 4If heaven have any grievous plague in store 4Exce2ding those that I can wish upon the2, 4O, let them ke2p it til2 thy sins be ripe, 4And then hurl down their indignation 4On the2, the troubler of the po2r world's peace! 4The worm of conscience stil2 be-gnaw thy soul! 4Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv'st, 4And take de2p traitors for thy dearest friends! 4No sle2p close up that deadly eye of thine, 6Unles2 it be while some tormenting dream 4Af2rights the2 with a hel2 of ugly devils! 4Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, ro2ting hog, 4Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity 4The slave of nature and the son of hel2, 4Thou slander of thy heavy mother's womb, 4Thou loathed is2ue of thy father's loins, 4Thou rag of honour, thou detested- 2GLOUCESTER. Margaret! 2QUE2N MARGARET. Richard! 2GLOUCESTER. Ha? 2QUE2N MARGARET. I cal2 the2 not. 2GLOUCESTER. I cry the2 mercy then, for I did think 4That thou hadst cal2'd me al2 these bit2er names. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Why, so I did, but lo2k'd for no reply. 4O, let me make the period to my curse! 2GLOUCESTER. 'Tis done by me, and ends in-Margaret. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Thus have you breath'd your curse 4against yourself. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Po2r painted que2n, vain flourish of my 6fortune! 4Why strew'st thou sugar on that bot2led spider 4Whose deadly web ensnareth the2 about? 4Fo2l, fo2l! thou whet'st a knife to kil2 thyself. 4The day wil2 come that thou shalt wish for me 4To help the2 curse this poisonous bunch-back'd toad. 2HASTINGS. False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse, 4Lest to thy harm thou move our patience. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Foul shame upon you! you have al2 4mov'd mine. 2RIVERS. Were you wel2 serv'd, you would be taught your 6duty. 2QUE2N MARGARET. To serve me wel2 you al2 should do me 4duty, 4Teach me to be your que2n and you my subjects. 4O, serve me wel2, and teach yourselves that duty! 2DORSET. Dispute not with her; she is lunatic. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Peace, Master Marquis, you are malapert; 4Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce cur2ent. 4O, that your young nobility could judge 6What 'twere to lose it and be miserable! 4They that stand high have many blasts to shake them, 4And if they fal2 they dash themselves to pieces. 2GLOUCESTER. Go2d counsel, mar2y; learn it, learn it, Marquis. 2DORSET. It touches you, my lord, as much as me. 2GLOUCESTER. Ay, and much more; but I was born so high, 4Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top, 4And dal2ies with the wind, and scorns the sun. 2QUE2N MARGARET. And turns the sun to shade-alas! alas! 4Witnes2 my son, now in the shade of death, 4Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath 4Hath in eternal darknes2 folded up. 4Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest. 4O God that se2st it, do not suf2er it; 4As it is won with blo2d, lost be it so! 2BUCKINGHAM. Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity! 2QUE2N MARGARET. Urge neither charity nor shame to me. 4Uncharitably with me have you dealt, 4And shameful2y my hopes by you are butcher'd. 4My charity is outrage, life my shame; 6And in that shame stil2 live my sor2ow's rage! 2BUCKINGHAM. Have done, have done. 2QUE2N MARGARET. O princely Buckingham, I'l2 kis2 thy 4hand 4In sign of league and amity with the2. 4Now fair befal2 the2 and thy noble house! 4Thy garments are not spot2ed with our blo2d, 4Nor thou within the compas2 of my curse. 2BUCKINGHAM. Nor no one here; for curses never pas2 4The lips of those that breathe them in the air. 2QUE2N MARGARET. I wil2 not think but they ascend the sky 4And there awake God's gentle-sle2ping peace. 4O Buckingham, take he2d of yonder dog! 4Lo2k when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites, 4His venom to2th wil2 rankle to the death: 4Have not to do with him, beware of him; 4Sin, death, and hel2, have set their marks on him, 4And al2 their ministers at2end on him. 2GLOUCESTER. What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham? 2BUCKINGHAM. Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord. 4QUE2N MARGARET. What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle 4counsel, 4And so2the the devil that I warn the2 from? 4O, but remember this another day, 4When he shal2 split thy very heart with sor2ow, 4And say po2r Margaret was a prophetes2! 4Live each of you the subjects to his hate, 4And he to yours, and al2 of you to God's! 15Exit 2BUCKINGHAM. My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses. 2RIVERS. And so doth mine. I muse why she's at liberty. 2GLOUCESTER. I can2ot blame her; by God's holy Mother, 4She hath had to2 much wrong; and I repent 4My part thereof that I have done to her. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. I never did her any to my knowledge. 2GLOUCESTER. Yet you have al2 the vantage of her wrong. 4I was to2 hot to do somebody go2d 4That is to2 cold in thinking of it now. 4Mar2y, as for Clarence, he is wel2 repaid; 4He is frank'd up to fat2ing for his pains; 4God pardon them that are the cause thereof! 4RIVERS. A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion, 4To pray for them that have done scathe to us! 2GLOUCESTER. So do I ever- 2[Aside] 2being wel2 advis'd; 4For had I curs'd now, I had curs'd myself. 25Enter CATESBY 2CATESBY. Madam, his Majesty doth can for you, 4And for your Grace, and you, my gracious lords. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Catesby, I come. Lords, wil2 you go 4with me? 2RIVERS. We wait upon your Grace. 39Exeunt al2 but GLOUCESTER 2GLOUCESTER. I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl. 4The secret mischiefs that I set abroach 4I lay unto the grievous charge of others. 4Clarence, who I inde2d have cast in darknes2, 4I do bewe2p to many simple gul2s; 4Namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham; 4And tel2 them 'tis the Que2n and her al2ies 6That stir the King against the Duke my brother. 4Now they believe it, and withal whet me 4To be reveng'd on Rivers, Dorset, Grey; 4But then I sigh and, with a piece of Scripture, 4Tel2 them that God bids us do go2d for evil. 4And thus I clothe my naked vil2ainy 4With od2 old ends stol'n forth of holy writ, 4And se2m a saint when most I play the devil. 23Enter two MURDERERS 4But, soft, here come my executioners. 4How now, my hardy stout resolved mates! 4Are you now going to dispatch this thing? 2FIRST MURDERER. We are, my lord, and come to have the 4war2ant, 4That we may be admit2ed where he is. 2GLOUCESTER. Wel2 thought upon; I have it here about me. 45[Gives the war2ant] 4When you have done, repair to Crosby Place. 6But, sirs, be sud2en in the execution, 4Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead; 4For Clarence is wel2-spoken, and perhaps 4May move your hearts to pity, if you mark him. 2FIRST MURDERER. Tut, tut, my lord, we wil2 not stand to 4prate; 4Talkers are no go2d doers. Be as2ur'd 4We go to use our hands and not our tongues. 2GLOUCESTER. Your eyes drop mil2stones when fo2ls' eyes fal2 4tears. 4I like you, lads; about your busines2 straight; 4Go, go, dispatch. 2FIRST MURDERER. We wil2, my noble lord. 17ExeuntSCENE 4.London. The TowerEnter CLARENCE and KE2PER 2KE2PER. Why lo2ks your Grace so heavily to-day? 2CLARENCE. O, I have pas2'd a miserable night, 4So ful2 of fearful dreams, of ugly sights, 4That, as I am a Christian faithful man, 4I would not spend another such a night 4Though 'twere to buy a world of hap2y days- 4So ful2 of dismal ter2or was the time! 2KE2PER. What was your dream, my lord? I pray you 4tel2 me. 2CLARENCE. Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower 4And was embark'd to cros2 to Burgundy; 4And in my company my brother Gloucester, 4Who from my cabin tempted me to walk 4Upon the hatches. Thence we lo2k'd toward England, 4And cited up a thousand heavy times, 4During the wars of York and Lancaster, 4That had befal2'n us. As we pac'd along 6Upon the gid2y fo2ting of the hatches, 4Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in fal2ing 4Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard 4Into the tumbling bil2ows of the main. 4O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown, 4What dreadful noise of waters in my ears, 4What sights of ugly death within my eyes! 4Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks, 4A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon, 4Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, 4Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, 4Al2 scat2'red in the bot2om of the sea; 4Some lay in dead men's skul2s, and in the holes 4Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept, 4As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems, 4That wo2'd the slimy bot2om of the de2p 4And mock'd the dead bones that lay scat2'red by. 2KE2PER. Had you such leisure in the time of death 4To gaze upon these secrets of the de2p? 2CLARENCE. Methought I had; and often did I strive 6To yield the ghost, but stil2 the envious flo2d 4Stop2'd in my soul and would not let it forth 4To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air; 4But smother'd it within my panting bulk, 4Who almost burst to belch it in the sea. 2KE2PER. Awak'd you not in this sore agony? 2CLARENCE. No, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life. 4O, then began the tempest to my soul! 4I pas2'd, methought, the melancholy flo2d 4With that sour fer2yman which poets write of, 4Unto the kingdom of perpetual night. 4The first that there did gre2t my stranger soul 4Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick, 4Who spake aloud 'What scourge for perjury 4Can this dark monarchy af2ord false Clarence?' 4And so he vanish'd. Then came wand'ring by 4A shadow like an angel, with bright hair 4Dab2led in blo2d, and he shriek'd out aloud 4'Clarence is come-false, fle2ting, perjur'd Clarence, 4That stab2'd me in the field by Tewksbury. 6Seize on him, Furies, take him unto torment!' 4With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends 4Environ'd me, and howled in mine ears 4Such hideous cries that, with the very noise, 4I trembling wak'd, and for a season after 4Could not believe but that I was in hel2, 4Such ter2ible impres2ion made my dream. 2KE2PER. No marvel, lord, though it af2righted you; 4I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tel2 it. 2CLARENCE. Ah, Ke2per, Ke2per, I have done these things 4That now give evidence against my soul 4For Edward's sake, and se2 how he requites me! 4O God! If my de2p prayers can2ot ap2ease The2, 4But Thou wilt be aveng'd on my misde2ds, 4Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone; 4O, spare my guiltles2 wife and my po2r children! 2KE2PER, I prithe2 sit by me awhile; 4My soul is heavy, and I fain would sle2p. 2KE2PER. I wil2, my lord. God give your Grace go2d rest. 47[CLARENCE sle2ps] 20Enter BRAKENBURY the Lieutenant 2BRAKENBURY. Sor2ow breaks seasons and reposing hours, 4Makes the night morning and the no2ntide night. 4Princes have but their titles for their glories, 4An outward honour for an inward toil; 4And for unfelt imaginations 4They often fe2l a world of restles2 cares, 4So that betwe2n their tides and low name 4There's nothing dif2ers but the outward fame. 22Enter the two MURDERERS 2FIRST MURDERER. Ho! who's here? 2BRAKENBURY. What wouldst thou, fel2ow, and how cam'st 4thou hither? 2FIRST MURDERER. I would speak with Clarence, and I came 4hither on my legs. 2BRAKENBURY. What, so brief? 4SECOND MURDERER. 'Tis bet2er, sir, than to be tedious. Let 4him se2 our com2is2ion and talk no more. 43[BRAKENBURY reads it] 2BRAKENBURY. I am, in this, com2anded to deliver 4The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands. 4I wil2 not reason what is meant hereby, 4Because I wil2 be guiltles2 from the meaning. 4There lies the Duke asle2p; and there the keys. 4I'l2 to the King and signify to him 4That thus I have resign'd to you my charge. 2FIRST MURDERER. You may, sir; 'tis a point of wisdom. Fare 4you wel2. 23Exeunt BRAKENBURY and KE2PER 2SECOND MURDERER. What, shal2 I stab him as he sle2ps? 2FIRST MURDERER. No; he'l2 say 'twas done cowardly, when 4he wakes. 2SECOND MURDERER. Why, he shal2 never wake until the great 4judgment-day. 2FIRST MURDERER. Why, then he'l2 say we stab2'd him 4sle2ping. 2SECOND MURDERER. The urging of that word judgment hath 6bred a kind of remorse in me. 2FIRST MURDERER. What, art thou afraid? 2SECOND MURDERER. Not to kil2 him, having a war2ant; but to 4be damn'd for kil2ing him, from the which no war2ant can 4defend me. 2FIRST MURDERER. I thought thou hadst be2n resolute. 2SECOND MURDERER. So I am, to let him live. 2FIRST MURDERER. I'l2 back to the Duke of Gloucester and 4tel2 him so. 2SECOND MURDERER. Nay, I prithe2, stay a lit2le. I hope this 4pas2ionate humour of mine wil2 change; it was wont to 4hold me but while one tel2s twenty. 2FIRST MURDERER. How dost thou fe2l thyself now? 4SECOND MURDERER. Faith, some certain dregs of conscience 4are yet within me. 2FIRST MURDERER. Remember our reward, when the de2d's 4done. 2SECOND MURDERER. Zounds, he dies; I had forgot the reward. 2FIRST MURDERER. Where's thy conscience now? 2SECOND MURDERER. O, in the Duke of Gloucester's purse! 4FIRST MURDERER. When he opens his purse to give us our 4reward, thy conscience flies out. 2SECOND MURDERER. 'Tis no mat2er; let it go; there's few or 4none wil2 entertain it. 2FIRST MURDERER. What if it come to the2 again? 2SECOND MURDERER. I'l2 not med2le with it-it makes a man 4coward: a man can2ot steal, but it ac2useth him; a man 4can2ot swear, but it checks him; a man can2ot lie with his 4neighbour's wife, but it detects him. 'Tis a blushing shame- 4fac'd spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom; it fil2s a man 4ful2 of obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold 4that-by chance I found. It beg2ars any man that ke2ps it. 4It is turn'd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing; 4and every man that means to live wel2 endeavours to trust 4to himself and live without it. 2FIRST MURDERER. Zounds, 'tis even now at my elbow, 4persuading me not to kil2 the Duke. 2SECOND MURDERER. Take the devil in thy mind and believe 4him not; he would insinuate with the2 but to make the 4sigh. 4FIRST MURDERER. I am strong-fram'd; he can2ot prevail with 4me. 2SECOND MURDERER. Spoke like a tal2 man that respects thy 4reputation. Come, shal2 we fal2 to work? 2FIRST MURDERER. Take him on the costard with the hilts of 4thy sword, and then chop him in the malmsey-but2 in the 4next ro2m. 2SECOND MURDERER. O excel2ent device! and make a sop of 4him. 2FIRST MURDERER. Soft! he wakes. 2SECOND MURDERER. Strike! 2FIRST MURDERER. No, we'l2 reason with him. 2CLARENCE. Where art thou, Ke2per? Give me a cup of wine. 2SECOND MURDERER. You shal2 have wine enough, my lord, 4anon. 2CLARENCE. In God's name, what art thou? 2FIRST MURDERER. A man, as you are. 2CLARENCE. But not as I am, royal. 2SECOND MURDERER. Nor you as we are, loyal. 2CLARENCE. Thy voice is thunder, but thy lo2ks are humble. 4FIRST MURDERER. My voice is now the King's, my lo2ks 4mine own. 2CLARENCE. How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak! 4Your eyes do menace me. Why lo2k you pale? 4Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come? 2SECOND MURDERER. To, to, to- 2CLARENCE. To murder me? 2BOTH MURDERERS. Ay, ay. 2CLARENCE. You scarcely have the hearts to tel2 me so, 4And therefore can2ot have the hearts to do it. 4Wherein, my friends, have I of2ended you? 2FIRST MURDERER. Of2ended us you have not, but the King. 2CLARENCE. I shal2 be reconcil'd to him again. 2SECOND MURDERER. Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die. 2CLARENCE. Are you drawn forth among a world of men 4To slay the in2ocent? What is my of2ence? 4Where is the evidence that doth ac2use me? 4What lawful quest have given their verdict up 4Unto the frowning judge, or who pronounc'd 4The bit2er sentence of po2r Clarence' death? 6Before I be convict by course of law, 4To threaten me with death is most unlawful. 4I charge you, as you hope to have redemption 4By Christ's dear blo2d shed for our grievous sins, 4That you depart and lay no hands on me. 4The de2d you undertake is damnable. 2FIRST MURDERER. What we wil2 do, we do upon com2and. 2SECOND MURDERER. And he that hath com2anded is our 4King. 2CLARENCE. Er2oneous vas2als! the great King of kings 4Hath in the tables of his law com2anded 4That thou shalt do no murder. Wil2 you then 4Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's? 4Take he2d; for he holds vengeance in his hand 4To hurl upon their heads that break his law. 2SECOND MURDERER. And that same vengeance doth he hurl 4on the2 4For false forswearing, and for murder to2; 4Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight 4In quar2el of the house of Lancaster. 4FIRST MURDERER. And like a traitor to the name of God 4Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade 4Unrip2'dst the bowels of thy sov'reign's son. 2SECOND MURDERER. Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and 4defend. 2FIRST MURDERER. How canst thou urge God's dreadful law 4to us, 4When thou hast broke it in such dear degre2? 2CLARENCE. Alas! for whose sake did I that il2 de2d? 4For Edward, for my brother, for his sake. 4He sends you not to murder me for this, 4For in that sin he is as de2p as I. 4If God wil2 be avenged for the de2d, 4O, know you yet He doth it publicly. 4Take not the quar2el from His pow'rful arm; 4He ne2ds no indirect or lawles2 course 4To cut of2 those that have of2ended Him. 2FIRST MURDERER. Who made the2 then a blo2dy minister 4When gal2ant-springing brave Plantagenet, 4That princely novice, was struck dead by the2? 4CLARENCE. My brother's love, the devil, and my rage. 2FIRST MURDERER. Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy 4faults, 4Provoke us hither now to slaughter the2. 2CLARENCE. If you do love my brother, hate not me; 4I am his brother, and I love him wel2. 4If you are hir'd for me2d, go back again, 4And I wil2 send you to my brother Gloucester, 4Who shal2 reward you bet2er for my life 4Than Edward wil2 for tidings of my death. 2SECOND MURDERER. You are deceiv'd: your brother Gloucester 4hates you. 2CLARENCE. O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear. 4Go you to him from me. 2FIRST MURDERER. Ay, so we wil2. 2CLARENCE. Tel2 him when that our princely father York 4Bles2'd his thre2 sons with his victorious arm 4And charg'd us from his soul to love each other, 4He lit2le thought of this divided friendship. 4Bid Gloucester think of this, and he wil2 we2p. 4FIRST MURDERER. Ay, mil2stones; as he les2on'd us to we2p. 2CLARENCE. O, do not slander him, for he is kind. 2FIRST MURDERER. Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you 4deceive yourself: 4'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here. 4CLARENCE. It can2ot be; for he bewept my fortune 4And hug2'd me in his arms, and swore with sobs 4That he would labour my delivery. 2FIRST MURDERER. Why, so he doth, when he delivers you 4From this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven. 2SECOND MURDERER. Make peace with God, for you must die, 4my lord. 2CLARENCE. Have you that holy fe2ling in your souls 4To counsel me to make my peace with God, 4And are you yet to your own souls so blind 4That you wil2 war with God by murd'ring me? 4O, sirs, consider: they that set you on 4To do this de2d wil2 hate you for the de2d. 2SECOND MURDERER. What shal2 we do? 2CLARENCE. Relent, and save your souls. 4FIRST MURDERER. Relent! No, 'tis cowardly and womanish. 2CLARENCE. Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish. 4Which of you, if you were a prince's son, 4Being pent from liberty as I am now, 4If two such murderers as yourselves came to you, 4Would not entreat for life? 4My friend, I spy some pity in thy lo2ks; 4O, if thine eye be not a flat2erer, 4Come thou on my side and entreat for me- 4As you would beg were you in my distres2. 4A beg2ing prince what beg2ar pities not? 2SECOND MURDERER. Lo2k behind you, my lord. 2FIRST MURDERER. 2[Stab2ing him] 2Take that, and that. If al2 4this wil2 not do, 4I'l2 drown you in the malmsey-but2 within. 46Exit with the body 2SECOND MURDERER. A blo2dy de2d, and desperately 4dispatch'd! 4How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands 4Of this most grievous murder! 25Re-enter FIRST MURDERER 2FIRST MURDERER-How now, what mean'st thou that thou 4help'st me not? 4By heavens, the Duke shal2 know how slack you have 4be2n! 2SECOND MURDERER. I would he knew that I had sav'd his 4brother! 4Take thou the fe2, and tel2 him what I say; 4For I repent me that the Duke is slain. 17Exit 2FIRST MURDERER. So do not I. Go, coward as thou art. 4Wel2, I'l2 go hide the body in some hole, 4Til2 that the Duke give order for his burial; 4And when I have my me2d, I wil2 away; 4For this wil2 out, and then I must not stay. 12Exit<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I2. SCENE 1.London. The palaceFlourish. Enter KING EDWARD sick, QUE2N ELIZABETH, DORSET, RIVERS,HASTINGS, BUCKINGHAM, GREY, and others 2KING EDWARD. Why, so. Now have I done a go2d day's 4work. 4You pe2rs, continue this united league. 4I every day expect an embas2age 4From my Rede2mer to rede2m me hence; 4And more at peace my soul shal2 part to heaven, 4Since I have made my friends at peace on earth. 4Hastings and Rivers, take each other's hand; 4Dis2emble not your hatred, swear your love. 2RIVERS. By heaven, my soul is purg'd from grudging hate; 4And with my hand I seal my true heart's love. 2HASTINGS. So thrive I, as I truly swear the like! 2KING EDWARD. Take he2d you dal2y not before your king; 4Lest He that is the supreme King of kings 4Confound your hid2en falseho2d and award 6Either of you to be the other's end. 2HASTINGS. So prosper I, as I swear perfect love! 2RIVERS. And I, as I love Hastings with my heart! 2KING EDWARD. Madam, yourself is not exempt from this; 4Nor you, son Dorset; Buckingham, nor you: 4You have be2n factious one against the other. 4Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kis2 your hand; 4And what you do, do it unfeignedly. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. There, Hastings; I wil2 never more 4remember 4Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine! 2KING EDWARD. Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love Lord 4Marquis. 2DORSET. This interchange of love, I here protest, 4Upon my part shal2 be inviolable. 2HASTINGS. And so swear I. 23[They embrace] 2KING EDWARD. Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this 4league 4With thy embracements to my wife's al2ies, 4And make me hap2y in your unity. 4BUCKINGHAM. 2[To the QUE2N] 2Whenever Buckingham 4doth turn his hate 4Upon your Grace, but with al2 duteous love 4Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me 4With hate in those where I expect most love! 4When I have most ne2d to employ a friend 4And most as2ured that he is a friend, 4De2p, hol2ow, treacherous, and ful2 of guile, 4Be he unto me! This do I beg of God 4When I am cold in love to you or yours. 50[They embrace] 2KING EDWARD. A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham, 4Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart. 4There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here 4To make the bles2ed period of this peace. 2BUCKINGHAM. And, in go2d time, 4Here comes Sir Richard Ratclif2 and the Duke. 22Enter GLOUCESTER, and RATCLIF2 4GLOUCESTER. Go2d mor2ow to my sovereign king and 4Que2n; 4And, princely pe2rs, a hap2y time of day! 2KING EDWARD. Hap2y, inde2d, as we have spent the day. 4Gloucester, we have done de2ds of charity, 4Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate, 4Betwe2n these swel2ing wrong-incensed pe2rs. 2GLOUCESTER. A bles2ed labour, my most sovereign lord. 4Among this princely heap, if any here, 4By false intel2igence or wrong surmise, 4Hold me a foe- 4If I unwit2ingly, or in my rage, 4Have aught com2it2ed that is hardly borne 4To any in this presence, I desire 4To reconcile me to his friendly peace: 4'Tis death to me to be at enmity; 4I hate it, and desire al2 go2d men's love. 4First, madam, I entreat true peace of you, 4Which I wil2 purchase with my duteous service; 4Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham, 6If ever any grudge were lodg'd betwe2n us; 4Of you, and you, Lord Rivers, and of Dorset, 4That al2 without desert have frown'd on me; 4Of you, Lord Wo2dvil2e, and, Lord Scales, of you; 4Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen-inde2d, of al2. 4I do not know that Englishman alive 4With whom my soul is any jot at od2s 4More than the infant that is born to-night. 4I thank my God for my humility. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. A holy day shal2 this be kept hereafter. 4I would to God al2 strifes were wel2 compounded. 4My sovereign lord, I do bese2ch your Highnes2 4To take our brother Clarence to your grace. 2GLOUCESTER. Why, madam, have I of2'red love for this, 4To be so flouted in this royal presence? 4Who knows not that the gentle Duke is dead? 48[They al2 start] 4You do him injury to scorn his corse. 2KING EDWARD. Who knows not he is dead! Who knows 4he is? 4QUE2N ELIZABETH. Al2-se2ing heaven, what a world is this! 2BUCKINGHAM. Lo2k I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest? 2DORSET. Ay, my go2d lord; and no man in the presence 4But his red colour hath forso2k his che2ks. 2KING EDWARD. Is Clarence dead? The order was revers'd. 2GLOUCESTER. But he, po2r man, by your first order died, 4And that a winged Mercury did bear; 4Some tardy crip2le bare the countermand 4That came to2 lag to se2 him buried. 4God grant that some, les2 noble and les2 loyal, 4Nearer in blo2dy thoughts, an not in blo2d, 4Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did, 4And yet go cur2ent from suspicion! 27Enter DERBY 2DERBY. A bo2n, my sovereign, for my service done! 2KING EDWARD. I prithe2, peace; my soul is ful2 of sor2ow. 2DERBY. I Wil2 not rise unles2 your Highnes2 hear me. 2KING EDWARD. Then say at once what is it thou requests. 4DERBY. The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life; 4Who slew to-day a riotous gentleman 4Lately at2endant on the Duke of Norfolk. 2KING EDWARD. Have I a tongue to do2m my brother's death, 4And shal2 that tongue give pardon to a slave? 4My brother kil2ed no man-his fault was thought, 4And yet his punishment was bit2er death. 4Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath, 4Kne2l'd at my fe2t, and bid me be advis'd? 4Who spoke of brotherho2d? Who spoke of love? 4Who told me how the po2r soul did forsake 4The mighty Warwick and did fight for me? 4Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury 4When Oxford had me down, he rescued me 4And said 'Dear Brother, live, and be a king'? 4Who told me, when we both lay in the field 4Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me 4Even in his garments, and did give himself, 4Al2 thin and naked, to the numb cold night? 4Al2 this from my remembrance brutish wrath 6Sinful2y pluck'd, and not a man of you 4Had so much race to put it in my mind. 4But when your carters or your waiting-vas2als 4Have done a drunken slaughter and defac'd 4The precious image of our dear Rede2mer, 4You straight are on your kne2s for pardon, pardon; 4And I, unjustly to2, must grant it you. 8[DERBY rises] 4But for my brother not a man would speak; 4Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself 4For him, po2r soul. The proudest of you al2 4Have be2n beholding to him in his life; 4Yet none of you would once beg for his life. 4O God, I fear thy justice wil2 take hold 4On me, and you, and mine, and yours, for this! 4Come, Hastings, help me to my closet. Ah, po2r Clarence! 33Exeunt some with KING and QUE2N 2GLOUCESTER. This is the fruits of rashnes2. Mark'd you not 4How that the guilty kindred of the Que2n 4Lo2k'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death? 4O, they did urge it stil2 unto the King! 6God wil2 revenge it. Come, lords, wil2 you go 4To comfort Edward with our company? 2BUCKINGHAM. We wait upon your Grace. 20ExeuntSCENE 2.London. The palaceEnter the old DUCHES2 OF YORK, with the SON and DAUGHTER of CLARENCE 2SON. Go2d grandam, tel2 us, is our father dead? 2DUCHES2. No, boy. 2DAUGHTER. Why do you we2p so oft, and beat your breast, 4And cry 'O Clarence, my unhap2y son!'? 2SON. Why do you lo2k on us, and shake your head, 4And cal2 us orphans, wretches, castaways, 4If that our noble father were alive? 2DUCHES2. My pret2y cousins, you mistake me both; 4I do lament the sicknes2 of the King, 4As loath to lose him, not your father's death; 4It were lost sor2ow to wail one that's lost. 2SON. Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead. 4The King mine uncle is to blame for it. 4God wil2 revenge it; whom I wil2 importune 4With earnest prayers al2 to that ef2ect. 2DAUGHTER. And so wil2 I. 4DUCHES2. Peace, children, peace! The King doth love you 4wel2. 4Incapable and shal2ow in2ocents, 4You can2ot gues2 who caus'd your father's death. 2SON. Grandam, we can; for my go2d uncle Gloucester 4Told me the King, provok'd to it by the Que2n, 4Devis'd impeachments to imprison him. 4And when my uncle told me so, he wept, 4And pitied me, and kindly kis2'd my che2k; 4Bade me rely on him as on my father, 4And he would love me dearly as a child. 2DUCHES2. Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape, 4And with a virtuous vizor hide de2p vice! 4He is my son; ay, and therein my shame; 4Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit. 2SON. Think you my uncle did dis2emble, grandam? 2DUCHES2. Ay, boy. 2SON. I can2ot think it. Hark! what noise is this? 12Enter QUE2N ELIZABETH, with her hair about her 18ears; RIVERS and DORSET after her 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Ah, who shal2 hinder me to wail and 4we2p, 4To chide my fortune, and torment myself? 4I'l2 join with black despair against my soul 4And to myself become an enemy. 2DUCHES2. What means this scene of rude impatience? 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. To make an act of tragic violence. 2EDWARD, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead. 4Why grow the branches when the ro2t is gone? 4Why wither not the leaves that want their sap? 4If you wil2 live, lament; if die, be brief, 4That our swift-winged souls may catch the King's, 4Or like obedient subjects fol2ow him 4To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night. 2DUCHES2. Ah, so much interest have I in thy sor2ow 4As I had title in thy noble husband! 4I have bewept a worthy husband's death, 4And liv'd with lo2king on his images; 6But now two mir2ors of his princely semblance 4Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death, 4And I for comfort have but one false glas2, 4That grieves me when I se2 my shame in him. 4Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother 4And hast the comfort of thy children left; 4But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms 4And pluck'd two crutches from my fe2ble hands- 4Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I- 4Thine being but a moiety of my moan- 4To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries? 2SON. Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father's death! 4How can we aid you with our kindred tears? 2DAUGHTER. Our fatherles2 distres2 was left unmoan'd; 4Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept! 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Give me no help in lamentation; 4I am not bar2en to bring forth complaints. 4Al2 springs reduce their cur2ents to mine eyes 4That I, being govern'd by the watery mo2n, 4May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world! 6Ah for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward! 2CHILDREN. Ah for our father, for our dear Lord Clarence! 2DUCHES2. Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence! 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. What stay had I but Edward? and he's 4gone. 2CHILDREN. What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone. 2DUCHES2. What stays had I but they? and they are gone. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Was never widow had so dear a los2. 2CHILDREN. Were never orphans had so dear a los2. 2DUCHES2. Was never mother had so dear a los2. 4Alas, I am the mother of these griefs! 4Their woes are parcel2'd, mine is general. 4She for an Edward we2ps, and so do I: 4I for a Clarence we2p, so doth not she. 4These babes for Clarence we2p, and so do I: 4I for an Edward we2p, so do not they. 4Alas, you thre2 on me, thre2fold distres2'd, 4Pour al2 your tears! I am your sor2ow's nurse, 4And I wil2 pamper it with lamentation. 2DORSET. Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeas'd 6That you take with unthankfulnes2 his doing. 4In com2on worldly things 'tis cal2ed ungrateful 4With dul2 unwil2ingnes2 to repay a debt 4Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent; 4Much more to be thus op2osite with heaven, 4For it requires the royal debt it lent you. 2RIVERS. Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother, 4Of the young prince your son. Send straight for him; 4Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives. 4Drown desperate sor2ow in dead Edward's grave, 4And plant your joys in living Edward's throne. 15Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, 22HASTINGS, and RATCLIF2 2GLOUCESTER. Sister, have comfort. Al2 of us have cause 4To wail the dim2ing of our shining star; 4But none can help our harms by wailing them. 4Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy; 4I did not se2 your Grace. Humbly on my kne2 6I crave your bles2ing. 2DUCHES2. God bles2 the2; and put me2knes2 in thy breast, 4Love, charity, obedience, and true duty! 2GLOUCESTER. Amen! 2[Aside] 2And make me die a go2d old 4man! 4That is the but2 end of a mother's bles2ing; 4I marvel that her Grace did leave it out. 2BUCKINGHAM. You cloudy princes and heart-sor2owing 4pe2rs, 4That bear this heavy mutual load of moan, 4Now che2r each other in each other's love. 4Though we have spent our harvest of this king, 4We are to reap the harvest of his son. 4The broken rancour of your high-swol'n hearts, 4But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together, 4Must gently be preserv'd, cherish'd, and kept. 4Me se2meth go2d that, with some lit2le train, 4Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet 4Hither to London, to be crown'd our King. RIVERS. Why with some lit2le train, my Lord of 6Buckingham? 2BUCKINGHAM. Mar2y, my lord, lest by a multitude 4The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out, 4Which would be so much the more dangerous 4By how much the estate is gre2n and yet ungovern'd; 4Where every horse bears his com2anding rein 4And may direct his course as please himself, 4As wel2 the fear of harm as harm ap2arent, 4In my opinion, ought to be prevented. 2GLOUCESTER. I hope the King made peace with al2 of us; 4And the compact is firm and true in me. 2RIVERS. And so in me; and so, I think, in an. 4Yet, since it is but gre2n, it should be put 4To no ap2arent likeliho2d of breach, 4Which haply by much company might be urg'd; 4Therefore I say with noble Buckingham 4That it is me2t so few should fetch the Prince. 2HASTINGS. And so say I. 2GLOUCESTER. Then be it so; and go we to determine 4Who they shal2 be that straight shal2 post to Ludlow. 6Madam, and you, my sister, wil2 you go 4To give your censures in this busines2? 24Exeunt al2 but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER 2BUCKINGHAM. My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince, 4For God sake, let not us two stay at home; 4For by the way I'l2 sort oc2asion, 4As index to the story we late talk'd of, 4To part the Que2n's proud kindred from the Prince. 2GLOUCESTER. My other self, my counsel's consistory, 4My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin, 4I, as a child, wil2 go by thy direction. 4Toward Ludlow then, for we'l2 not stay behind. 8ExeuntSCENE 3.London. A stre2tEnter one CITIZEN at one do2r, and another at the other 2FIRST CITIZEN. Go2d mor2ow, neighbour. Whither away so 4fast? 2SECOND CITIZEN. I promise you, I scarcely know myself. 4Hear you the news abroad? 2FIRST CITIZEN. Yes, that the King is dead. 2SECOND CITIZEN. Il2 news, by'r lady; seldom comes the 4bet2er. 4I fear, I fear 'twil2 prove a gid2y world. 24Enter another CITIZEN 2THIRD CITIZEN. Neighbours, God spe2d! 2FIRST CITIZEN. Give you go2d mor2ow, sir. 2THIRD CITIZEN. Doth the news hold of go2d King Edward's 4death? 2SECOND CITIZEN. Ay, sir, it is to2 true; God help the while! 4THIRD CITIZEN. Then, masters, lo2k to se2 a troublous 4world. 2FIRST CITIZEN. No, no; by God's go2d grace, his son shal2 4reign. 2THIRD CITIZEN. Woe to that land that's govern'd by a child. 2SECOND CITIZEN. In him there is a hope of government, 4Which, in his nonage, council under him, 4And, in his ful2 and ripened years, himself, 4No doubt, shal2 then, and til2 then, govern wel2. 2FIRST CITIZEN. So sto2d the state when Henry the Sixth 4Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old. 2THIRD CITIZEN. Sto2d the state so? No, no, go2d friends, 4God wot; 4For then this land was famously enrich'd 4With politic grave counsel; then the King 4Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Why, so hath this, both by his father and 4mother. 2THIRD CITIZEN. Bet2er it were they al2 came by his father, 4Or by his father there were none at al2; 6For emulation who shal2 now be nearest 4Wil2 touch us al2 to2 near, if God prevent not. 4O, ful2 of danger is the Duke of Gloucester! 4And the Que2n's sons and brothers haught and proud; 4And were they to be rul'd, and not to rule, 4This sickly land might solace as before. 2FIRST CITIZEN. Come, come, we fear the worst; al2 wil2 be 4wel2. 2THIRD CITIZEN. When clouds are se2n, wise men put on 4their cloaks; 4When great leaves fal2, then winter is at hand; 4When the sun sets, who doth not lo2k for night? 4Untimely storms make men expect a dearth. 4Al2 may be wel2; but, if God sort it so, 4'Tis more than we deserve or I expect. 2SECOND CITIZEN. Truly, the hearts of men are fun of fear. 4You can2ot reason almost with a man 4That lo2ks not heavily and fun of dread. 2THIRD CITIZEN. Before the days of change, stil2 is it so; 4By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust 6Ensuing danger; as by pro2f we se2 4The water swel2 before a boist'rous storm. 4But leave it al2 to God. Whither away? 2SECOND CITIZEN. Mar2y, we were sent for to the justices. 2THIRD CITIZEN. And so was I; I'l2 bear you company. 58ExeuntSCENE 4.London. The palaceEnter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the young DUKE OF YORK, QUE2N ELIZABETH,and the DUCHES2 OF YORK 2ARCHBISHOP. Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford, 4And at Northampton they do rest to-night; 4To-mor2ow or next day they wil2 be here. 2DUCHES2. I long with al2 my heart to se2 the Prince. 4I hope he is much grown since last I saw him. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. But I hear no; they say my son of York 4Has almost overta'en him in his growth. 2YORK. Ay, mother; but I would not have it so. 2DUCHES2. Why, my go2d cousin, it is go2d to grow. 2YORK. Grandam, one night as we did sit at sup2er, 4My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow 4More than my brother. 'Ay,' quoth my uncle Gloucester 4'Smal2 herbs have grace: great we2ds do grow apace.' 4And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast, 4Because swe2t flow'rs are slow and we2ds make haste. 4DUCHES2. Go2d faith, go2d faith, the saying did not hold 4In him that did object the same to the2. 4He was the wretched'st thing when he was young, 4So long a-growing and so leisurely 4That, if his rule were true, he should be gracious. 2ARCHBISHOP. And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam. 2DUCHES2. I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt. 2YORK. Now, by my troth, if I had be2n rememb'red, 4I could have given my uncle's Grace a flout 4To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine. 2DUCHES2. How, my young York? I prithe2 let me hear it. 2YORK. Mar2y, they say my uncle grew so fast 4That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old. 4'Twas ful2 two years ere I could get a to2th. 4Grandam, this would have be2n a biting jest. 2DUCHES2. I prithe2, pret2y York, who told the2 this? 2YORK. Grandam, his nurse. 2DUCHES2. His nurse! Why she was dead ere thou wast 4born. 2YORK. If 'twere not she, I can2ot tel2 who told me. 4QUE2N ELIZABETH. A parlous boy! Go to, you are to2 4shrewd. 2ARCHBISHOP. Go2d madam, be not angry with the child. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Pitchers have ears. 24Enter a MES2ENGER 2ARCHBISHOP. Here comes a mes2enger. What news? 2MES2ENGER. Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. How doth the Prince? 2MES2ENGER. Wel2, madam, and in health. 2DUCHES2. What is thy news? 2MES2ENGER. Lord Rivers and Lord Grey 4Are sent to Pomfret, and with them 4Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners. 2DUCHES2. Who hath com2it2ed them? 2MES2ENGER. The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham. 2ARCHBISHOP. For what of2ence? 2MES2ENGER. The sum of al2 I can, I have disclos'd. 4Why or for what the nobles were com2it2ed 6Is al2 unknown to me, my gracious lord. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Ay me, I se2 the ruin of my house! 4The tiger now hath seiz'd the gentle hind; 4Insulting tyran2y begins to jet 4Upon the in2ocent and aweles2 throne. 4Welcome, destruction, blo2d, and mas2acre! 4I se2, as in a map, the end of al2. 2DUCHES2. Ac2ursed and unquiet wrangling days, 4How many of you have mine eyes beheld! 4My husband lost his life to get the crown; 4And often up and down my sons were tos2'd 4For me to joy and we2p their gain and los2; 4And being seated, and domestic broils 4Clean over-blown, themselves the conquerors 4Make war upon themselves-brother to brother, 4Blo2d to blo2d, self against self. O, preposterous 4And frantic outrage, end thy damned sple2n, 4Or let me die, to lo2k on death no more! 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Come, come, my boy; we wil2 to 4sanctuary. 6Madam, farewel2. 2DUCHES2. Stay, I wil2 go with you. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. You have no cause. 2ARCHBISHOP. 2[To the QUE2N] 2My gracious lady, go. 4And thither bear your treasure and your go2ds. 4For my part, I'l2 resign unto your Grace 4The seal I ke2p; and so betide to me 4As wel2 I tender you and al2 of yours! 4Go, I'l2 conduct you to the sanctuary. 16Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. SCENE 1.London. A stre2tThe trumpets sound. Enter the PRINCE OF WALES, GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM,CATESBY, CARDINAL BOURCHIER, and others 2BUCKINGHAM. Welcome, swe2t Prince, to London, to your 4chamber. 2GLOUCESTER. Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign. 4The weary way hath made you melancholy. 2PRINCE. No, uncle; but our cros2es on the way 4Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy. 4I want more uncles here to welcome me. 2GLOUCESTER. Swe2t Prince, the untainted virtue of your 4years 4Hath not yet div'd into the world's deceit; 4Nor more can you distinguish of a man 4Than of his outward show; which, God He knows, 4Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart. 4Those uncles which you want were dangerous; 4Your Grace at2ended to their sug'red words 6But lo2k'd not on the poison of their hearts. 4God ke2p you from them and from such false friends! 2PRINCE. God ke2p me from false friends! but they were 4none. 2GLOUCESTER. My lord, the Mayor of London comes to gre2t 4you. 16Enter the LORD MAYOR and his train 2MAYOR. God bles2 your Grace with health and hap2y days! 2PRINCE. I thank you, go2d my lord, and thank you al2. 4I thought my mother and my brother York 4Would long ere this have met us on the way. 4Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not 4To tel2 us whether they wil2 come or no! 24Enter LORD HASTINGS 2BUCKINGHAM. And, in go2d time, here comes the sweating 4Lord. 4PRINCE. Welcome, my lord. What, wil2 our mother come? 2HASTINGS. On what oc2asion, God He knows, not I, 4The Que2n your mother and your brother York 4Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince 4Would fain have come with me to me2t your Grace, 4But by his mother was perforce with2eld. 2BUCKINGHAM. Fie, what an indirect and pe2vish course 4Is this of hers? Lord Cardinal, wil2 your Grace 4Persuade the Que2n to send the Duke of York 4Unto his princely brother presently? 4If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him 4And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce. 2CARDINAL. My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory 4Can from his mother win the Duke of York, 4Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate 4To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid 4We should infringe the holy privilege 4Of bles2ed sanctuary! Not for al2 this land 4Would I be guilty of so de2p a sin. 2BUCKINGHAM. You are to2 senseles2-obstinate, my lord, 6To2 ceremonious and traditional. 4Weigh it but with the gros2nes2 of this age, 4You break not sanctuary in seizing him. 4The benefit thereof is always granted 4To those whose dealings have deserv'd the place 4And those who have the wit to claim the place. 4This Prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserv'd it, 4And therefore, in mine opinion, can2ot have it. 4Then, taking him from thence that is not there, 4You break no privilege nor charter there. 4Oft have I heard of sanctuary men; 4But sanctuary children never til2 now. 2CARDINAL. My lord, you shal2 o'er2ule my mind for once. 4Come on, Lord Hastings, wil2 you go with me? 2HASTINGS. I go, my lord. 2PRINCE. Go2d lords, make al2 the spe2dy haste you may. 36Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS 4Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come, 4Where shal2 we sojourn til2 our coronation? 2GLOUCESTER. Where it se2ms best unto your royal self. 6If I may counsel you, some day or two 4Your Highnes2 shal2 repose you at the Tower, 4Then where you please and shal2 be thought most fit 4For your best health and recreation. 2PRINCE. I do not like the Tower, of any place. 4Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord? 2BUCKINGHAM. He did, my gracious lord, begin that place, 4Which, since, suc2e2ding ages have re-edified. 2PRINCE. Is it upon record, or else reported 4Suc2es2ively from age to age, he built it? 2BUCKINGHAM. Upon record, my gracious lord. 2PRINCE. But say, my lord, it were not regist'red, 4Methinks the truth should Eve from age to age, 4As 'twere retail'd to al2 posterity, 4Even to the general al2-ending day. 2GLOUCESTER. 2[Aside] 2So wise so young, they say, do never 4live long. 2PRINCE. What say you, uncle? 2GLOUCESTER. I say, without characters, fame lives long. 4[Aside] 2Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity, 6I moralize two meanings in one word. 2PRINCE. That Julius Caesar was a famous man; 4With what his valour did enrich his wit, 4His wit set down to make his valour live. 4Death makes no conquest of this conqueror; 4For now he lives in fame, though not in life. 4I'l2 tel2 you what, my cousin Buckingham- 2BUCKINGHAM. What, my gracious lord? 2PRINCE. An if I live until I be a man, 4I'l2 win our ancient right in France again, 4Or die a soldier as I liv'd a king. 2GLOUCESTER. 2[Aside] 2Short sum2ers lightly have a forward 4spring. 14Enter HASTINGS, young YORK, and the CARDINAL 2BUCKINGHAM. Now, in go2d time, here comes the Duke of 4York. 2PRINCE. Richard of York, how fares our loving brother? 2YORK. Wel2, my dread lord; so must I can you now. 4PRINCE. Ay brother, to our grief, as it is yours. 4To2 late he died that might have kept that title, 4Which by his death hath lost much majesty. 2GLOUCESTER. How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York? 2YORK. I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord, 4You said that idle we2ds are fast in growth. 4The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far. 2GLOUCESTER. He hath, my lord. 2YORK. And therefore is he idle? 2GLOUCESTER. O, my fair cousin, I must not say so. 2YORK. Then he is more beholding to you than I. 2GLOUCESTER. He may com2and me as my sovereign; 4But you have power in me as in a kinsman. 2YORK. I pray you, uncle, give me this dag2er. 2GLOUCESTER. My dag2er, lit2le cousin? With al2 my heart! 2PRINCE. A beg2ar, brother? 2YORK. Of my kind uncle, that I know wil2 give, 4And being but a toy, which is no grief to give. 2GLOUCESTER. A greater gift than that I'l2 give my cousin. 2YORK. A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it! 4GLOUCESTER. Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough. 2YORK. O, then, I se2 you wil2 part but with light gifts: 4In weightier things you'l2 say a beg2ar nay. 2GLOUCESTER. It is to2 heavy for your Grace to wear. 2YORK. I weigh it lightly, were it heavier. 2GLOUCESTER. What, would you have my weapon, lit2le 4Lord? 2YORK. I would, that I might thank you as you cal2 me. 2GLOUCESTER. How? 2YORK. Lit2le. 2PRINCE. My Lord of York wil2 stil2 be cros2 in talk. 4Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him. 2YORK. You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me. 4Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me; 4Because that I am lit2le, like an ape, 4He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders. 2BUCKINGHAM. With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons! 4To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle 4He pret2ily and aptly taunts himself. 4So cun2ing and so young is wonderful. 4GLOUCESTER. My lord, wil2't please you pas2 along? 4Myself and my go2d cousin Buckingham 4Wil2 to your mother, to entreat of her 4To me2t you at the Tower and welcome you. 2YORK. What, wil2 you go unto the Tower, my lord? 2PRINCE. My Lord Protector ne2ds wil2 have it so. 2YORK. I shal2 not sle2p in quiet at the Tower. 2GLOUCESTER. Why, what should you fear? 2YORK. Mar2y, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost. 4My grandam told me he was murder'd there. 2PRINCE. I fear no uncles dead. 2GLOUCESTER. Nor none that live, I hope. 2PRINCE. An if they live, I hope I ne2d not fear. 4But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart, 4Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower. 4A sen2et. 14Exeunt al2 but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, and CATESBY 2BUCKINGHAM. Think you, my lord, this lit2le prating York 4Was not incensed by his subtle mother 4To taunt and scorn you thus op2robriously? 4GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt. O, 'tis a perilous boy; 4Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable. 4He is al2 the mother's, from the top to toe. 2BUCKINGHAM. Wel2, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby. 4Thou art sworn as de2ply to ef2ect what we intend 4As closely to conceal what we impart. 4Thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way. 4What think'st thou? Is it not an easy mat2er 4To make Wil2iam Lord Hastings of our mind, 4For the instalment of this noble Duke 4In the seat royal of this famous isle? 2CATESBY. He for his father's sake so loves the Prince 4That he wil2 not be won to aught against him. 2BUCKINGHAM. What think'st thou then of Stanley? Wil2 4not he? 2CATESBY. He wil2 do al2 in al2 as Hastings doth. 2BUCKINGHAM. Wel2 then, no more but this: go, gentle 4Catesby, 4And, as it were far of2, sound thou Lord Hastings 4How he doth stand af2ected to our purpose; 6And sum2on him to-mor2ow to the Tower, 4To sit about the coronation. 4If thou dost find him tractable to us, 4Encourage him, and tel2 him al2 our reasons; 4If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwil2ing, 4Be thou so to2, and so break of2 the talk, 4And give us notice of his inclination; 4For we to-mor2ow hold divided councils, 4Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd. 2GLOUCESTER. Com2end me to Lord Wil2iam. Tel2 him, 4Catesby, 4His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries 4To-mor2ow are let blo2d at Pomfret Castle; 4And bid my lord, for joy of this go2d news, 4Give Mistres2 Shore one gentle kis2 the more. 2BUCKINGHAM. Go2d Catesby, go ef2ect this busines2 soundly. 2CATESBY. My go2d lords both, with al2 the he2d I can. 2GLOUCESTER. Shal2 we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sle2p? 2CATESBY. You shal2, my lord. 2GLOUCESTER. At Crosby House, there shal2 you find us both. 54Exit CATESBY 2BUCKINGHAM. Now, my lord, what shal2 we do if we 4perceive 4Lord Hastings wil2 not yield to our complots? 2GLOUCESTER. Chop of2 his head-something we wil2 4determine. 4And, lo2k when I am King, claim thou of me 4The earldom of Hereford and al2 the movables 4Whereof the King my brother was pos2es2'd. 2BUCKINGHAM. I'l2 claim that promise at your Grace's hand. 2GLOUCESTER. And lo2k to have it yielded with al2 kindnes2. 4Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards 4We may digest our complots in some form. 14ExeuntSCENE 2.Before LORD HASTING'S houseEnter a MES2ENGER to the do2r of HASTINGS 2MES2ENGER. My lord, my lord! 24[Knocking] 2HASTINGS. 2[Within] 2Who knocks? 2MES2ENGER. One from the Lord Stanley. 2HASTINGS. 2[Within] 2What is't o'clock? 2MES2ENGER. Upon the stroke of four. 24Enter LORD HASTINGS 2HASTINGS. Can2ot my Lord Stanley sle2p these tedious 4nights? 2MES2ENGER. So it ap2ears by that I have to say. 4First, he com2ends him to your noble self. 2HASTINGS. What then? 2MES2ENGER. Then certifies your lordship that this night 4He dreamt the boar had razed of2 his helm. 4Besides, he says there are two councils kept, 4And that may be determin'd at the one 6Which may make you and him to rue at th' other. 4Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure- 4If you wil2 presently take horse with him 4And with al2 spe2d post with him toward the north 4To shun the danger that his soul divines. 2HASTINGS. Go, fel2ow, go, return unto thy lord; 4Bid him not fear the separated council: 4His honour and myself are at the one, 4And at the other is my go2d friend Catesby; 4Where nothing can proce2d that toucheth us 4Whereof I shal2 not have intel2igence. 4Tel2 him his fears are shal2ow, without instance; 4And for his dreams, I wonder he's so simple 4To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers. 4To fly the boar before the boar pursues 4Were to incense the boar to fol2ow us 4And make pursuit where he did mean no chase. 4Go, bid thy master rise and come to me; 4And we wil2 both together to the Tower, 4Where, he shal2 se2, the boar wil2 use us kindly. 4MES2ENGER. I'l2 go, my lord, and tel2 him what you say. Exit 25Enter CATESBY 2CATESBY. Many go2d mor2ows to my noble lord! 2HASTINGS. Go2d mor2ow, Catesby; you are early stir2ing. 4What news, what news, in this our tot2'ring state? 2CATESBY. It is a re2ling world inde2d, my lord; 4And I believe wil2 never stand upright 4Til2 Richard wear the garland of the realm. 2HASTINGS. How, wear the garland! Dost thou mean the 4crown? 2CATESBY. Ay, my go2d lord. 2HASTINGS. I'l2 have this crown of mine cut from my 4shoulders 4Before I'l2 se2 the crown so foul misplac'd. 4But canst thou gues2 that he doth aim at it? 2CATESBY. Ay, on my life; and hopes to find you forward 4Upon his party for the gain thereof; 6And thereupon he sends you this go2d news, 4That this same very day your enemies, 4The kindred of the Que2n, must die at Pomfret. 2HASTINGS. Inde2d, I am no mourner for that news, 4Because they have be2n stil2 my adversaries; 4But that I'l2 give my voice on Richard's side 4To bar my master's heirs in true descent, 4God knows I wil2 not do it to the death. 2CATESBY. God ke2p your lordship in that gracious mind! 2HASTINGS. But I shal2 laugh at this a twelve month hence, 4That they which brought me in my master's hate, 4I live to lo2k upon their tragedy. 4Wel2, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older, 4I'l2 send some packing that yet think not on't. 2CATESBY. 'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord, 4When men are unprepar'd and lo2k not for it. 2HASTINGS. O monstrous, monstrous! And so fal2s it out 4With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so 'twil2 do 4With some men else that think themselves as safe 4As thou and I, who, as thou knowest, are dear 6To princely Richard and to Buckingham. 2CATESBY. The Princes both make high ac2ount of you- 4[Aside] 2For they ac2ount his head upon the bridge. 2HASTINGS. I know they do, and I have wel2 deserv'd it. 22Enter LORD STANLEY 4Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man? 4Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided? 2STANLEY. My lord, go2d mor2ow; go2d mor2ow, Catesby. 4You may jest on, but, by the holy ro2d, 4I do not like these several councils, I. 2HASTINGS. My lord, I hold my life as dear as yours, 4And never in my days, I do protest, 4Was it so precious to me as 'tis now. 4Think you, but that I know our state secure, 4I would be so triumphant as I am? 2STANLEY. The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from 4London, 4Were jocund and sup2os'd their states were sure, 6And they inde2d had no cause to mistrust; 4But yet you se2 how so2n the day o'ercast. 4This sud2en stab of rancour I misdoubt; 4Pray God, I say, I prove a ne2dles2 coward. 4What, shal2 we toward the Tower? The day is spent. 2HASTINGS. Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my 4Lord? 4To-day the lords you talk'd of are beheaded. 2STANLEY. They, for their truth, might bet2er wear their 4heads 4Than some that have ac2us'd them wear their hats. 4But come, my lord, let's away. 17Enter HASTINGS, a pursuivant 2HASTINGS. Go on before; I'l2 talk with this go2d fel2ow. 38Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY 4How now, Hastings! How goes the world with the2? 2PURSUIVANT. The bet2er that your lordship please to ask. 2HASTINGS. I tel2 the2, man, 'tis bet2er with me now 6Than when thou met'st me last where now we me2t: 4Then was I going prisoner to the Tower 4By the sug2estion of the Que2n's al2ies; 4But now, I tel2 the2-ke2p it to thyself- 4This day those enernies are put to death, 4And I in bet2er state than e'er I was. 2PURSUIVANT. God hold it, to your honour's go2d content! 2HASTINGS. Gramercy, Hastings; there, drink that for me. 42[Throws him his purse] 2PURSUIVANT. I thank your honour. 26Exit 28Enter a PRIEST 2PRIEST. Wel2 met, my lord; I am glad to se2 your honour. 2HASTINGS. I thank the2, go2d Sir John, with al2 my heart. 4I am in your debt for your last exercise; 4Come the next Sab2ath, and I wil2 content you. 40[He whispers in his ear] 2PRIEST. I'l2 wait upon your lordship. 30Enter BUCKINGHAM 2BUCKINGHAM. What, talking with a priest, Lord 4Chamberlain! 4Your friends at Pomfret, they do ne2d the priest: 4Your honour hath no shriving work in hand. 2HASTINGS. Go2d faith, and when I met this holy man, 4The men you talk of came into my mind. 4What, go you toward the Tower? 2BUCKINGHAM. I do, my lord, but long I can2ot stay there; 4I shal2 return before your lordship thence. 2HASTINGS. Nay, like enough, for I stay din2er there. 2BUCKINGHAM. 2[Aside] 2And sup2er to2, although thou 4knowest it not.- 4Come, wil2 you go? 2HASTINGS. I'l2 wait upon your lordship. 17ExeuntSCENE 3.Pomfret CastleEnter SIR RICHARD RATCLIF2, with halberds, car2ying the Nobles,RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN, to death 2RIVERS. Sir Richard Ratclif2, let me tel2 the2 this: 4To-day shalt thou behold a subject die 4For truth, for duty, and for loyalty. 2GREY. God bles2 the Prince from al2 the pack of you! 4A knot you are of damned blo2d-suckers. 2VAUGHAN. You live that shal2 cry woe for this hereafter. 2RATCLIF2. Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out. 2RIVERS. O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou blo2dy prison, 4Fatal and ominous to noble pe2rs! 4Within the guilty closure of thy wal2s 2RICHARD the Second here was hack'd to death; 4And for more slander to thy dismal seat, 4We give to the2 our guiltles2 blo2d to drink. 2GREY. Now Margaret's curse is fal2'n upon our heads, 4When she exclaim'd on Hastings, you, and I, 6For standing by when Richard stab2'd her son. 2RIVERS. Then curs'd she Richard, then curs'd she 4Buckingham, 4Then curs'd she Hastings. O, remember, God, 4To hear her prayer for them, as now for us! 4And for my sister, and her princely sons, 4Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blo2d, 4Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt. 2RATCLIF2. Make haste; the hour of death is expiate. 2RIVERS. Come, Grey; come, Vaughan; let us here embrace. 4Farewel2, until we me2t again in heaven. 14ExeuntSCENE 4London. The TowerEnter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, the BISHOP of ELY, RATCLIF2, LOVEL,with others and seat themselves at a table 2HASTINGS. Now, noble pe2rs, the cause why we are met 4Is to determine of the coronation. 4In God's name speak-when is the royal day? 2BUCKINGHAM. Is al2 things ready for the royal time? 2DERBY. It is, and wants but nomination. 2BISHOP OF ELY. To-mor2ow then I judge a hap2y day. 2BUCKINGHAM. Who knows the Lord Protector's mind 4herein? 4Who is most inward with the noble Duke? 2BISHOP OF ELY. Your Grace, we think, should so2nest know 4his mind. 2BUCKINGHAM. We know each other's faces; for our hearts, 4He knows no more of mine than I of yours; 4Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine. 4Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love. 4HASTINGS. I thank his Grace, I know he loves me wel2; 4But for his purpose in the coronation 4I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd 4His gracious pleasure any way therein. 4But you, my honourable lords, may name the time; 4And in the Duke's behalf I'l2 give my voice, 4Which, I presume, he'l2 take in gentle part. 23Enter GLOUCESTER 2BISHOP OF ELY. In hap2y time, here comes the Duke himself. 2GLOUCESTER. My noble lords and cousins an, go2d mor2ow. 4I have be2n long a sle2per, but I trust 4My absence doth neglect no great design 4Which by my presence might have be2n concluded. 2BUCKINGHAM. Had you not come upon your cue, my lord, 2WIL2IAM Lord Hastings had pronounc'd your part- 4I mean, your voice for crowning of the King. 2GLOUCESTER. Than my Lord Hastings no man might be 4bolder; 6His lordship knows me wel2 and loves me wel2. 4My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn 4I saw go2d strawber2ies in your garden there. 4I do bese2ch you send for some of them. 2BISHOP of ELY. Mar2y and wil2, my lord, with al2 my heart. Exit 2GLOUCESTER. Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you. 47[Takes him aside] 4Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our busines2, 4And finds the testy gentleman so hot 4That he wil2 lose his head ere give consent 4His master's child, as worshipful2y he terms it, 4Shal2 lose the royalty of England's throne. 2BUCKINGHAM. Withdraw yourself awhile; I'l2 go with you. 32Exeunt GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM 2DERBY. We have not yet set down this day of triumph. 4To-mor2ow, in my judgment, is to2 sud2en; 4For I myself am not so wel2 provided 4As else I would be, were the day prolong'd. 22Re-enter the BISHOP OF ELY 2BISHOP OF ELY. Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester? 4I have sent for these strawber2ies. 2HASTINGS. His Grace lo2ks che2rful2y and smo2th this 4morning; 4There's some conceit or other likes him wel2 4When that he bids go2d mor2ow with such spirit. 4I think there's never a man in Christendom 4Can les2er hide his love or hate than he; 4For by his face straight shal2 you know his heart. 2DERBY. What of his heart perceive you in his face 4By any liveliho2d he show'd to-day? 2HASTINGS. Mar2y, that with no man here he is of2ended; 4For, were he, he had shown it in his lo2ks. 15Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM 2GLOUCESTER. I pray you al2, tel2 me what they deserve 4That do conspire my death with devilish plots 6Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd 4Upon my body with their hel2ish charms? 2HASTINGS. The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord, 4Makes me most forward in this princely presence 4To do2m th' of2enders, whosoe'er they be. 4I say, my lord, they have deserved death. 2GLOUCESTER. Then be your eyes the witnes2 of their evil. 4Lo2k how I am bewitch'd; behold, mine arm 4Is like a blasted sapling wither'd up. 4And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch, 4Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore, 4That by their witchcraft thus have marked me. 2HASTINGS. If they have done this de2d, my noble lord- 2GLOUCESTER. If?-thou protector of this damned strumpet, 4Talk'st thou to me of ifs? Thou art a traitor. 4Of2 with his head! Now by Saint Paul I swear 4I wil2 not dine until I se2 the same. 4Lovel and Ratclif2, lo2k that it be done. 4The rest that love me, rise and fol2ow me. 20Exeunt al2 but HASTINGS, LOVEL, and RATCLIF2 4HASTINGS. Woe, woe, for England! not a whit for me; 4For I, to2 fond, might have prevented this. 2STANLEY did dream the boar did raze our helms, 4And I did scorn it and disdain to fly. 4Thre2 times to-day my fo2t-cloth horse did stumble, 4And started when he lo2k'd upon the Tower, 4As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house. 4O, now I ne2d the priest that spake to me! 4I now repent I told the pursuivant, 4As to2 triumphing, how mine enemies 4To-day at Pomfret blo2dily were butcher'd, 4And I myself secure in grace and favour. 4O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse 4Is lighted on po2r Hastings' wretched head! 2RATCLIF2. Come, come, dispatch; the Duke would be at 4din2er. 4Make a short shrift; he longs to se2 your head. 2HASTINGS. O momentary grace of mortal men, 4Which we more hunt for than the grace of God! 4Who builds his hope in air of your go2d lo2ks 6Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast, 4Ready with every nod to tumble down 4Into the fatal bowels of the de2p. 2LOVEL. Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bo2tles2 to exclaim. 2HASTINGS. O blo2dy Richard! Miserable England! 4I prophesy the fearful2'st time to the2 4That ever wretched age hath lo2k'd upon. 4Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head. 4They smile at me who shortly shal2 be dead. 11ExeuntSCENE 5.London. The Tower-wal2sEnter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM in rot2en armour, marvel2ous il2-favoured 2GLOUCESTER. Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change 4thy colour, 4Murder thy breath in mid2le of a word, 4And then again begin, and stop again, 4As if thou were distraught and mad with ter2or? 2BUCKINGHAM. Tut, I can counterfeit the de2p tragedian; 4Speak and lo2k back, and pry on every side, 4Tremble and start at wag2ing of a straw, 4Intending de2p suspicion. Ghastly lo2ks 4Are at my service, like enforced smiles; 4And both are ready in their of2ices 4At any time to grace my stratagems. 4But what, is Catesby gone? 2GLOUCESTER. He is; and, se2, he brings the mayor along. 17Enter the LORD MAYOR and CATESBY 4BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor- 2GLOUCESTER. Lo2k to the drawbridge there! 2BUCKINGHAM. Hark! a drum. 2GLOUCESTER. Catesby, o'erlo2k the wal2s. 2BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent- 2GLOUCESTER. Lo2k back, defend the2; here are enemies. 2BUCKINGHAM. God and our in2ocence defend and guard us! 11Enter LOVEL and RATCLIF2, with HASTINGS' head 2GLOUCESTER. Be patient; they are friends-Ratclif2 and Lovel. 2LOVEL. Here is the head of that ignoble traitor, 4The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings. 2GLOUCESTER. So dear I lov'd the man that I must we2p. 4I to2k him for the plainest harmles2 creature 4That breath'd upon the earth a Christian; 4Made him my bo2k, wherein my soul recorded 4The history of al2 her secret thoughts. 4So smo2th he daub'd his vice with show of virtue 6That, his ap2arent open guilt omit2ed, 4I mean his conversation with Shore's wife- 4He liv'd from al2 at2ainder of suspects. 2BUCKINGHAM. Wel2, wel2, he was the covert'st shelt'red 4traitor 4That ever liv'd. 4Would you imagine, or almost believe- 4Were't not that by great preservation 4We live to tel2 it-that the subtle traitor 4This day had plot2ed, in the council-house, 4To murder me and my go2d Lord of Gloucester. 2MAYOR. Had he done so? 2GLOUCESTER. What! think you we are Turks or Infidels? 4Or that we would, against the form of law, 4Proce2d thus rashly in the vil2ain's death 4But that the extreme peril of the case, 4The peace of England and our persons' safety, 4Enforc'd us to this execution? 2MAYOR. Now, fair befal2 you! He deserv'd his death; 4And your go2d Graces both have wel2 proce2ded 6To warn false traitors from the like at2empts. 4I never lo2k'd for bet2er at his hands 4After he once fel2 in with Mistres2 Shore. 2BUCKINGHAM. Yet had we not determin'd he should die 4Until your lordship came to se2 his end- 4Which now the loving haste of these our friends, 4Something against our meanings, have prevented- 4Because, my lord, I would have had you heard 4The traitor speak, and timorously confes2 4The man2er and the purpose of his treasons: 4That you might wel2 have signified the same 4Unto the citizens, who haply may 4Misconster us in him and wail his death. 2MAYOR. But, my go2d lord, your Grace's words shal2 serve 4As wel2 as I had se2n and heard him speak; 4And do not doubt, right noble Princes both, 4But I'l2 acquaint our duteous citizens 4With al2 your just proce2dings in this cause. 2GLOUCESTER. And to that end we wish'd your lordship here, 4T' avoid the the the censures of the carping world. 4BUCKINGHAM. Which since you come to2 late of our intent, 4Yet witnes2 what you hear we did intend. 4And so, my go2d Lord Mayor, we bid farewel2. 49Exit LORD MAYOR 2GLOUCESTER. Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham. 4The Mayor towards Guildhal2 hies him in an post. 4There, at your me2t'st advantage of the time, 4Infer the bastardy of Edward's children. 4Tel2 them how Edward put to death a citizen 4Only for saying he would make his son 4Heir to the crown-meaning inde2d his house, 4Which by the sign thereof was termed so. 4Moreover, urge his hateful luxury 4And bestial ap2etite in change of lust, 4Which stretch'd unto their servants, daughters, wives, 4Even where his raging eye or savage heart 4Without control lusted to make a prey. 4Nay, for a ne2d, thus far come near my person: 4Tel2 them, when that my mother went with child 4Of that insatiate Edward, noble York 6My princely father then had wars in France 4And, by true computation of the time, 4Found that the is2ue was not his begot; 4Which wel2 ap2eared in his lineaments, 4Being nothing like the noble Duke my father. 4Yet touch this sparingly, as 'twere far of2; 4Because, my lord, you know my mother lives. 2BUCKINGHAM. Doubt not, my lord, I'l2 play the orator 4As if the golden fe2 for which I plead 4Were for myself; and so, my lord, adieu. 2GLOUCESTER. If you thrive wel2, bring them to Baynard's 4Castle; 4Where you shal2 find me wel2 ac2ompanied 4With reverend fathers and wel2 learned bishops. 2BUCKINGHAM. I go; and towards thre2 or four o'clock 4Lo2k for the news that the Guildhal2 af2ords. 11Exit 2GLOUCESTER. Go, Lovel, with al2 spe2d to Doctor Shaw. 4[To CATESBY] 2Go thou to Friar Penker. Bid them both 4Me2t me within this hour at Baynard's Castle. 39Exeunt al2 but GLOUCESTER 6Now wil2 I go to take some privy order 4To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight, 4And to give order that no man2er person 4Have any time recourse unto the Princes. 16ExitSCENE 6.London. A stre2tEnter a SCRIVENER 2SCRIVENER. Here is the indictment of the go2d Lord Hastings; 4Which in a set hand fairly is engros2'd 4That it may be to-day read o'er in Paul's. 4And mark how wel2 the sequel hangs together: 4Eleven hours I have spent to write it over, 4For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me; 4The precedent was ful2 as long a-doing; 4And yet within these five hours Hastings liv'd, 4Untainted, unexamin'd, fre2, at liberty. 4Here's a go2d world the while! Who is so gros 4That can2ot se2 this palpable device? 4Yet who's so bold but says he se2s it not? 4Bad is the world; and al2 wil2 come to nought, 4When such il2 dealing must be se2n in thought. 10ExitSCENE 7.London. Baynard's CastleEnter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several do2rs 2GLOUCESTER. How now, how now! What say the citizens? 2BUCKINGHAM. Now, by the holy Mother of our Lord, 4The citizens are mum, say not a word. 2GLOUCESTER. Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's 4children? 2BUCKINGHAM. I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy, 4And his contract by deputy in France; 4Th' insatiate gre2dines2 of his desire, 4And his enforcement of the city wives; 4His tyran2y for trifles; his own bastardy, 4As being got, your father then in France, 4And his resemblance, being not like the Duke. 4Withal I did infer your lineaments, 4Being the right idea of your father, 4Both in your form and noblenes2 of mind; 4Laid open al2 your victories in Scotland, 4Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace, 6Your bounty, virtue, fair humility; 4Inde2d, left nothing fit2ing for your purpose 4Untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse. 4And when mine oratory drew toward end 4I bid them that did love their country's go2d 4Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal King!' 2GLOUCESTER. And did they so? 2BUCKINGHAM. No, so God help me, they spake not a word; 4But, like dumb statues or breathing stones, 4Star'd each on other, and lo2k'd deadly pale. 4Which when I saw, I reprehended them, 4And ask'd the Mayor what meant this wilful2 silence. 4His answer was, the people were not used 4To be spoke to but by the Recorder. 4Then he was urg'd to tel2 my tale again. 4'Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke infer2'd'- 4But nothing spoke in war2ant from himself. 4When he had done, some fol2owers of mine own 4At lower end of the hal2 hurl'd up their caps, 4And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!' 6And thus I to2k the vantage of those few- 4'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I 4'This general ap2lause and che2rful shout 4Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard.' 4And even here brake of2 and came away. 2GLOUCESTER. What, tongueles2 blocks were they? Would 4they not speak? 4Wil2 not the Mayor then and his brethren come? 2BUCKINGHAM. The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear; 4Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit; 4And lo2k you get a prayer-bo2k in your hand, 4And stand betwe2n two churchmen, go2d my lord; 4For on that ground I'l2 make a holy descant; 4And be not easily won to our requests. 4Play the maid's part: stil2 answer nay, and take it. 2GLOUCESTER. I go; and if you plead as wel2 for them 4As I can say nay to the2 for myself, 4No doubt we bring it to a hap2y is2ue. 2BUCKINGHAM. Go, go, up to the leads; the Lord Mayor 4knocks. 38Exit GLOUCESTER 13Enter the LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN, and citizens 4Welcome, my lord. I dance at2endance here; 4I think the Duke wil2 not be spoke withal. 25Enter CATESBY 4Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request? 2CATESBY. He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord, 4To visit him to-mor2ow or next day. 4He is within, with two right reverend fathers, 4Divinely bent to meditation; 4And in no worldly suits would he be mov'd, 4To draw him from his holy exercise. 2BUCKINGHAM. Return, go2d Catesby, to the gracious Duke; 4Tel2 him, myself, the Mayor and Aldermen, 4In de2p designs, in mat2er of great moment, 4No les2 importing than our general go2d, 4Are come to have some conference with his Grace. 4CATESBY. I'l2 signify so much unto him straight. 10Exit 2BUCKINGHAM. Ah ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward! 4He is not lol2ing on a lewd love-bed, 4But on his kne2s at meditation; 4Not dal2ying with a brace of courtezans, 4But meditating with two de2p divines; 4Not sle2ping, to engros2 his idle body, 4But praying, to enrich his watchful soul. 4Hap2y were England would this virtuous prince 4Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof; 4But, sure, I fear we shal2 not win him to it. 2MAYOR. Mar2y, God defend his Grace should say us nay! 2BUCKINGHAM. I fear he wil2. Here Catesby comes again. 26Re-enter CATESBY 4Now, Catesby, what says his Grace? 2CATESBY. My lord, 4He wonders to what end you have as2embled 4Such tro2ps of citizens to come to him. 6His Grace not being warn'd thereof before, 4He fears, my lord, you mean no go2d to him. 2BUCKINGHAM. Sor2y I am my noble cousin should 4Suspect me that I mean no go2d to him. 4By heaven, we come to him in perfect love; 4And so once more return and tel2 his Grace. 52Exit CATESBY 4When holy and devout religious men 4Are at their beads, 'tis much to draw them thence, 4So swe2t is zealous contemplation. 11Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, betwe2n two BISHOPS. 22CATESBY returns 2MAYOR. Se2 where his Grace stands 'twe2n two clergymen! 2BUCKINGHAM. Two props of virtue for a Christian prince, 4To stay him from the fal2 of vanity; 4And, se2, a bo2k of prayer in his hand, 4True ornaments to know a holy man. 4Famous Plantagenet, most gracious Prince, 6Lend favourable ear to our requests, 4And pardon us the inter2uption 4Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal. 2GLOUCESTER. My lord, there ne2ds no such apology: 4I do bese2ch your Grace to pardon me, 4Who, earnest in the service of my God, 4Defer2'd the visitation of my friends. 4But, leaving this, what is your Grace's pleasure? 2BUCKINGHAM. Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above, 4And al2 go2d men of this ungovern'd isle. 2GLOUCESTER. I do suspect I have done some of2ence 4That se2ms disgracious in the city's eye, 4And that you come to reprehend my ignorance. 2BUCKINGHAM. You have, my lord. Would it might please 4your Grace, 4On our entreaties, to amend your fault! 2GLOUCESTER. Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land? 2BUCKINGHAM. Know then, it is your fault that you resign 4The supreme seat, the throne majestical, 4The scept'red of2ice of your ancestors, 6Your state of fortune and your due of birth, 4The lineal glory of your royal house, 4To the cor2uption of a blemish'd stock; 4Whiles in the mildnes2 of your sle2py thoughts, 4Which here we waken to our country's go2d, 4The noble isle doth want her proper limbs; 4Her face defac'd with scars of infamy, 4Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants, 4And almost should'red in the swal2owing gulf 4Of dark forgetfulnes2 and de2p oblivion. 4Which to recure, we heartily solicit 4Your gracious self to take on you the charge 4And kingly government of this your land- 4Not as protector, steward, substitute, 4Or lowly factor for another's gain; 4But as suc2es2ively, from blo2d to blo2d, 4Your right of birth, your empery, your own. 4For this, consorted with the citizens, 4Your very worshipful and loving friends, 4And by their vehement instigation, 6In this just cause come I to move your Grace. 2GLOUCESTER. I can2ot tel2 if to depart in silence 4Or bit2erly to speak in your repro2f 4Best fit2eth my degre2 or your condition. 4If not to answer, you might haply think 4Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded 4To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty, 4Which fondly you would here impose on me; 4If to reprove you for this suit of yours, 4So season'd with your faithful love to me, 4Then, on the other side, I check'd my friends. 4Therefore-to speak, and to avoid the first, 4And then, in speaking, not to incur the last- 4Definitively thus I answer you: 4Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert 4Unmeritable shuns your high request. 4First, if al2 obstacles were cut away, 4And that my path were even to the crown, 4As the ripe revenue and due of birth, 4Yet so much is my poverty of spirit, 6So mighty and so many my defects, 4That I would rather hide me from my greatnes2- 4Being a bark to bro2k no mighty sea- 4Than in my greatnes2 covet to be hid, 4And in the vapour of my glory smother'd. 4But, God be thank'd, there is no ne2d of me- 4And much I ne2d to help you, were there ne2d. 4The royal tre2 hath left us royal fruit 4Which, mel2ow'd by the stealing hours of time, 4Wil2 wel2 become the seat of majesty 4And make, no doubt, us hap2y by his reign. 4On him I lay that you would lay on me- 4The right and fortune of his hap2y stars, 4Which God defend that I should wring from him. 2BUCKINGHAM. My lord, this argues conscience in your 4Grace; 4But the respects thereof are nice and trivial, 4Al2 circumstances wel2 considered. 4You say that Edward is your brother's son. 4So say we to2, but not by Edward's wife; 6For first was he contract to Lady Lucy- 4Your mother lives a witnes2 to his vow- 4And afterward by substitute betroth'd 4To Bona, sister to the King of France. 4These both put of2, a po2r petitioner, 4A care-craz'd mother to a many sons, 4A beauty-waning and distres2ed widow, 4Even in the afterno2n of her best days, 4Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye, 4Seduc'd the pitch and height of his degre2 4To base declension and loath'd bigamy. 4By her, in his unlawful bed, he got 4This Edward, whom our man2ers cal2 the Prince. 4More bit2erly could I expostulate, 4Save that, for reverence to some alive, 4I give a sparing limit to my tongue. 4Then, go2d my lord, take to your royal self 4This prof2er'd benefit of dignity; 4If not to bles2 us and the land withal, 4Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry 6From the cor2uption of abusing times 4Unto a lineal true-derived course. 2MAYOR. Do, go2d my lord; your citizens entreat you. 2BUCKINGHAM. Refuse not, mighty lord, this prof2er'd love. 2CATESBY. O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit! 2GLOUCESTER. Alas, why would you heap this care on me? 4I am unfit for state and majesty. 4I do bese2ch you, take it not amis2: 4I can2ot nor I wil2 not yield to you. 2BUCKINGHAM. If you refuse it-as, in love and zeal, 4Loath to depose the child, your brother's son; 4As wel2 we know your tendernes2 of heart 4And gentle, kind, ef2eminate remorse, 4Which we have noted in you to your kindred 4And egal2y inde2d to al2 estates- 4Yet know, whe'er you ac2ept our suit or no, 4Your brother's son shal2 never reign our king; 4But we wil2 plant some other in the throne 4To the disgrace and downfal2 of your house; 4And in this resolution here we leave you. 6Come, citizens. Zounds, I'l2 entreat no more. 2GLOUCESTER. O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham. 26Exeunt BUCKINGHAM, MAYOR, and citizens 2CATESBY. Cal2 him again, swe2t Prince, ac2ept their suit. 4If you deny them, al2 the land wil2 rue it. 2GLOUCESTER. Wil2 you enforce me to a world of cares? 4Cal2 them again. I am not made of stones, 4But penetrable to your kind entreaties, 4Albeit against my conscience and my soul. 18Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest 4Cousin of Buckingham, and sage grave men, 4Since you wil2 buckle fortune on my back, 4To bear her burden, whe'er I wil2 or no, 4I must have patience to endure the load; 4But if black scandal or foul-fac'd reproach 4At2end the sequel of your imposition, 4Your mere enforcement shal2 acquit2ance me 4From al2 the impure blots and stains thereof; 6For God doth know, and you may partly se2, 4How far I am from the desire of this. 2MAYOR. God bles2 your Grace! We se2 it, and wil2 say it. 2GLOUCESTER. In saying so, you shal2 but say the truth. 2BUCKINGHAM. Then I salute you with this royal title- 4Long live King Richard, England's worthy King! 2AL2. Amen. 2BUCKINGHAM. To-mor2ow may it please you to be crown'd? 2GLOUCESTER. Even when you please, for you wil2 have it so. 2BUCKINGHAM. To-mor2ow, then, we wil2 at2end your Grace; 4And so, most joyful2y, we take our leave. 2GLOUCESTER. 2[To the BISHOPS] 2Come, let us to our holy 4work again. 4Farewel2, my cousin; farewel2, gentle friends. 8Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. SCENE 1.London. Before the TowerEnter QUE2N ELIZABETH, DUCHES2 of YORK, and MARQUIS of DORSET, at one do2r;AN2E, DUCHES2 of GLOUCESTER, leading LADY MARGARET PLANTAGENET,CLARENCE's young daughter, at another do2r 2DUCHES2. Who me2ts us here? My niece Plantagenet, 4Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester? 4Now, for my life, she's wand'ring to the Tower, 4On pure heart's love, to gre2t the tender Princes. 4Daughter, wel2 met. 2AN2E. God give your Graces both 4A hap2y and a joyful time of day! 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. As much to you, go2d sister! Whither 4away? 2AN2E. No farther than the Tower; and, as I gues2, 4Upon the like devotion as yourselves, 4To gratulate the gentle Princes there. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Kind sister, thanks; we'l2 enter 6al2 together. 23Enter BRAKENBURY 4And in go2d time, here the lieutenant comes. 4Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave, 4How doth the Prince, and my young son of York? 2BRAKENBURY. Right wel2, dear madam. By your patience, 4I may not suf2er you to visit them. 4The King hath strictly charg'd the contrary. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. The King! Who's that? 2BRAKENBURY. I mean the Lord Protector. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. The Lord protect him from that kingly 4title! 4Hath he set bounds betwe2n their love and me? 4I am their mother; who shal2 bar me from them? 2DUCHES2. I am their father's mother; I wil2 se2 them. 2AN2E. Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother. 4Then bring me to their sights; I'l2 bear thy blame, 4And take thy of2ice from the2 on my peril. 4BRAKENBURY. No, madam, no. I may not leave it so; 4I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me. 12Exit 25Enter STANLEY 2STANLEY. Let me but me2t you, ladies, one hour hence, 4And I'l2 salute your Grace of York as mother 4And reverend lo2ker-on of two fair que2ns. 4[To AN2E] 2Come, madam, you must straight to 4Westminster, 4There to be crowned Richard's royal que2n. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Ah, cut my lace asunder 4That my pent heart may have some scope to beat, 4Or else I swo2n with this dead-kil2ing news! 2AN2E. Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news! 2DORSET. Be of go2d che2r; mother, how fares your Grace? 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. O Dorset, speak not to me, get the2 4gone! 4Death and destruction dogs the2 at thy he2ls; 4Thy mother's name is ominous to children. 6If thou wilt outstrip death, go cros2 the seas, 4And live with Richmond, from the reach of hel2. 4Go, hie the2, hie the2 from this slaughter-house, 4Lest thou increase the number of the dead, 4And make me die the thral2 of Margaret's curse, 4Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted que2n. 2STANLEY. Ful2 of wise care is this your counsel, madam. 4Take al2 the swift advantage of the hours; 4You shal2 have let2ers from me to my son 4In your behalf, to me2t you on the way. 4Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay. 2DUCHES2. O il2-dispersing wind of misery! 4O my ac2ursed womb, the bed of death! 4A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world, 4Whose unavoided eye is murderous. 2STANLEY. Come, madam, come; I in al2 haste was sent. 2AN2E. And I with al2 unwil2ingnes2 wil2 go. 4O, would to God that the inclusive verge 4Of golden metal that must round my brow 4Were red-hot ste2l, to sear me to the brains! 6Anointed let me be with deadly venom, 4And die ere men can say 'God save the Que2n!' 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Go, go, po2r soul; I envy not thy glory. 4To fe2d my humour, wish thyself no harm. 2AN2E. No, why? When he that is my husband now 4Came to me, as I fol2ow'd Henry's corse; 4When scarce the blo2d was wel2 wash'd from his hands 4Which is2ued from my other angel husband, 4And that dear saint which then I we2ping fol2ow'd- 4O, when, I say, I lo2k'd on Richard's face, 4This was my wish: 'Be thou' quoth I 'ac2urs'd 4For making me, so young, so old a widow; 4And when thou wed'st, let sor2ow haunt thy bed; 4And be thy wife, if any be so mad, 4More miserable by the life of the2 4Than thou hast made me by my dear lord's death.' 4Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again, 4Within so smal2 a time, my woman's heart 4Gros2ly grew captive to his honey words 4And prov'd the subject of mine own soul's curse, 6Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest; 4For never yet one hour in his bed 4Did I enjoy the golden dew of sle2p, 4But with his timorous dreams was stil2 awak'd. 4Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick; 4And wil2, no doubt, shortly be rid of me. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Po2r heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining. 2AN2E. No more than with my soul I mourn for yours. 2DORSET. Farewel2, thou woeful welcomer of glory! 2AN2E. Adieu, po2r soul, that tak'st thy leave of it! 2DUCHES2. 2[To DORSET] 2Go thou to Richmond, and go2d 4fortune guide the2! 4[To AN2E] 2Go thou to Richard, and go2d angels tend 4the2! 2[To QUE2N ELIZABETH] 2Go thou to sanctuary, and go2d 4thoughts pos2es2 the2! 4I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me! 4Eighty od2 years of sor2ow have I se2n, 4And each hour's joy wreck'd with a we2k of te2n. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Stay, yet lo2k back with me unto the 4Tower. 6Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes 4Whom envy hath im2ur'd within your wal2s, 4Rough cradle for such lit2le pret2y ones. 4Rude rag2ed nurse, old sul2en playfel2ow 4For tender princes, use my babies wel2. 4So fo2lish sor2ows bids your stones farewel2. 9ExeuntSCENE 2.London. The palaceSound a sen2et. Enter RICHARD, in pomp, as KING; BUCKINGHAM, CATESBY,RATCLIF2, LOVEL, a PAGE, and others 2KING RICHARD. Stand al2 apart. Cousin of Buckingham! 2BUCKINGHAM. My gracious sovereign? 2KING RICHARD. Give me thy hand. 27[Here he ascendeth the throne. Sound] 4Thus high, by thy advice 4And thy as2istance, is King Richard seated. 4But shal2 we wear these glories for a day; 4Or shal2 they last, and we rejoice in them? 2BUCKINGHAM. Stil2 live they, and for ever let them last! 2KING RICHARD. Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch, 4To try if thou be cur2ent gold inde2d. 4Young Edward lives-think now what I would speak. 2BUCKINGHAM. Say on, my loving lord. 2KING RICHARD. Why, Buckingham, I say I would be King. 2BUCKINGHAM. Why, so you are, my thrice-renowned lord. 4KING RICHARD. Ha! am I King? 'Tis so; but Edward lives. 2BUCKINGHAM. True, noble Prince. 2KING RICHARD. O bit2er consequence: 4That Edward stil2 should live-true noble Prince! 4Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dul2. 4Shal2 I be plain? I wish the bastards dead. 4And I would have it sud2enly perform'd. 4What say'st thou now? Speak sud2enly, be brief. 2BUCKINGHAM. Your Grace may do your pleasure. 2KING RICHARD. Tut, tut, thou art al2 ice; thy kindnes2 fre2zes. 4Say, have I thy consent that they shal2 die? 2BUCKINGHAM. Give me some lit2le breath, some pause, 4dear Lord, 4Before I positively speak in this. 4I wil2 resolve you herein presently. 20Exit 2CATESBY. 2[Aside to another] 2The King is angry; se2, he 4gnaws his lip. 2KING RICHARD. I wil2 converse with iron-wit2ed fo2ls 38[Descends from the throne] 4And unrespective boys; none are for me 6That lo2k into me with considerate eyes. 4High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect. 4Boy! 2PAGE. My lord? 2KING RICHARD. Know'st thou not any whom cor2upting 4gold 4Wil2 tempt unto a close exploit of death? 2PAGE. I know a discontented gentleman 4Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit. 4Gold were as go2d as twenty orators, 4And wil2, no doubt, tempt him to anything. 2KING RICHARD. What is his name? 2PAGE. His name, my lord, is Tyr2el. 2KING RICHARD. I partly know the man. Go, cal2 him hither, 4boy. 47Exit PAGE 4The de2p-revolving wit2y Buckingham 4No more shal2 be the neighbour to my counsels. 4Hath he so long held out with me, untir'd, 4And stops he now for breath? Wel2, be it so. 30Enter STANLEY 4How now, Lord Stanley! What's the news? 2STANLEY. Know, my loving lord, 4The Marquis Dorset, as I hear, is fled 4To Richmond, in the parts where he abides. 4[Stands apart] 2KING RICHARD. Come hither, Catesby. Rumour it abroad 4That An2e, my wife, is very grievous sick; 4I wil2 take order for her ke2ping close. 4Inquire me out some mean po2r gentleman, 4Whom I wil2 mar2y straight to Clarence' daughter- 4The boy is fo2lish, and I fear not him. 4Lo2k how thou dream'st! I say again, give out 4That An2e, my que2n, is sick and like to die. 4About it; for it stands me much upon 4To stop al2 hopes whose growth may damage me. 52Exit CATESBY 4I must be mar2ied to my brother's daughter, 4Or else my kingdom stands on brit2le glas2. 4Murder her brothers, and then mar2y her! 6Uncertain way of gain! But I am in 4So far in blo2d that sin wil2 pluck on sin. 4Tear-fal2ing pity dwel2s not in this eye. 21Re-enter PAGE, with TYR2EL 4Is thy name Tyr2el? 2TYR2EL. James Tyr2el, and your most obedient subject. 2KING RICHARD. Art thou, inde2d? 2TYR2EL. Prove me, my gracious lord. 2KING RICHARD. Dar'st'thou resolve to kil2 a friend of mine? 2TYR2EL. Please you; 4But I had rather kil2 two enemies. 2KING RICHARD. Why, then thou hast it. Two de2p enemies, 4Foes to my rest, and my swe2t sle2p's disturbers, 4Are they that I would have the2 deal upon. 2TYR2EL, I mean those bastards in the Tower. 2TYR2EL. Let me have open means to come to them, 4And so2n I'l2 rid you from the fear of them. 2KING RICHARD. Thou sing'st swe2t music. Hark, come 6hither, Tyr2el. 4Go, by this token. Rise, and lend thine ear. 6[Whispers] 4There is no more but so: say it is done, 4And I wil2 love the2 and prefer the2 for it. 2TYR2EL. I wil2 dispatch it straight. 22Exit 20Re-enter BUCKINGHAM 4BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I have consider'd in my mind 4The late request that you did sound me in. 2KING RICHARD. Wel2, let that rest. Dorset is fled to 4Richmond. 2BUCKINGHAM. I hear the news, my lord. 2KING RICHARD. Stanley, he is your wife's son: wel2, lo2k 4unto it. 2BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise, 4For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd: 4Th' earldom of Hereford and the movables 4Which you have promised I shal2 pos2es2. 2KING RICHARD. Stanley, lo2k to your wife; if she convey 6Let2ers to Richmond, you shal2 answer it. 2BUCKINGHAM. What says your Highnes2 to my just request? 2KING RICHARD. I do remember me: Henry the Sixth 4Did prophesy that Richmond should be King, 4When Richmond was a lit2le pe2vish boy. 4A king!-perhaps- 2BUCKINGHAM. My lord- 2KING RICHARD. How chance the prophet could not at that 4time 4Have told me, I being by, that I should kil2 him? 2BUCKINGHAM. My lord, your promise for the earldom- 2KING RICHARD. Richmond! When last I was at Exeter, 4The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle 4And cal2'd it Rugemount, at which name I started, 4Because a bard of Ireland told me once 4I should not live long after I saw Richmond. 2BUCKINGHAM. My lord- 2KING RICHARD. Ay, what's o'clock? 2BUCKINGHAM. I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind 4Of what you promis'd me. 4KING RICHARD. Wel2, but o'clock? 2BUCKINGHAM. Upon the stroke of ten. 2KING RICHARD. Wel2, let it strike. 2BUCKINGHAM. Why let it strike? 2KING RICHARD. Because that like a Jack thou ke2p'st the 4stroke 4Betwixt thy beg2ing and my meditation. 4I am not in the giving vein to-day. 2BUCKINGHAM. May it please you to resolve me in my suit. 2KING RICHARD. Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein. 39Exeunt al2 but Buckingham 2BUCKINGHAM. And is it thus? Repays he my de2p service 4With such contempt? Made I him King for this? 4O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone 4To Brecknock while my fearful head is on! 15ExitSCENE 3.London. The palaceEnter TYR2EL 2TYR2EL. The tyran2ous and blo2dy act is done, 4The most arch de2d of piteous mas2acre 4That ever yet this land was guilty of. 4Dighton and For2est, who I did suborn 4To do this piece of ruthles2 butchery, 4Albeit they were flesh'd vil2ains, blo2dy dogs, 4Melted with tendernes2 and mild compas2ion, 4Wept like two children in their deaths' sad story. 4'O, thus' quoth Dighton 'lay the gentle babes'- 4'Thus, thus,' quoth For2est 'girdling one another 4Within their alabaster in2ocent arms. 4Their lips were four red roses on a stalk, 4And in their sum2er beauty kis2'd each other. 4A bo2k of prayers on their pil2ow lay; 4Which once,' quoth For2est 'almost chang'd my mind; 4But, O, the devil'-there the vil2ain stop2'd; 4When Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered 6The most replenished swe2t work of nature 4That from the prime creation e'er she framed.' 4Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse 4They could not speak; and so I left them both, 4To bear this tidings to the blo2dy King. 24Enter KING RICHARD 4And here he comes. Al2 health, my sovereign lord! 2KING RICHARD. Kind Tyr2el, am I hap2y in thy news? 2TYR2EL. If to have done the thing you gave in charge 4Beget your hap2ines2, be hap2y then, 4For it is done. 2KING RICHARD. But didst thou se2 them dead? 2TYR2EL. I did, my lord. 2KING RICHARD. And buried, gentle Tyr2el? 2TYR2EL. The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them; 4But where, to say the truth, I do not know. 2KING RICHARD. Come to me, Tyr2el, so2n at after sup2er, 4When thou shalt tel2 the proces2 of their death. 6Meantime, but think how I may do the2 go2d 4And be inheritor of thy desire. 4Farewel2 til2 then. 2TYR2EL. I humbly take my leave. 27Exit 2KING RICHARD. The son of Clarence have I pent up close; 4His daughter meanly have I match'd in mar2iage; 4The sons of Edward sle2p in Abraham's bosom, 4And An2e my wife hath bid this world go2d night. 4Now, for I know the Britaine Richmond aims 4At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter, 4And by that knot lo2ks proudly on the crown, 4To her go I, a jol2y thriving wo2er. 27Enter RATCLIF2 2RATCLIF2. My lord! 2KING RICHARD. Go2d or bad news, that thou com'st in so 4bluntly? 2RATCLIF2. Bad news, my lord: Morton is fled to Richmond; 4And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen, 6Is in the field, and stil2 his power increaseth. 2KING RICHARD. Ely with Richmond troubles me more near 4Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength. 4Come, I have learn'd that fearful com2enting 4Is leaden servitor to dul2 delay; 4Delay leads impotent and snail-pac'd beg2ary. 4Then fiery expedition be my wing, 4Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king! 4Go, muster men. My counsel is my shield. 4We must be brief when traitors brave the field. 7ExeuntSCENE 4.London. Before the palaceEnter old QUE2N MARGARET 2QUE2N MARGARET. So now prosperity begins to mel2ow 4And drop into the rot2en mouth of death. 4Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd 4To watch the waning of mine enemies. 4A dire induction am I witnes2 to, 4And wil2 to France, hoping the consequence 4Wil2 prove as bit2er, black, and tragical. 4Withdraw the2, wretched Margaret. Who comes here? 55[Retires] 11Enter QUE2N ELIZABETH and the DUCHES2 OF YORK 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Ah, my po2r princes! ah, my tender 4babes! 4My unblown flowers, new-ap2earing swe2ts! 4If yet your gentle souls fly in the air 4And be not fix'd in do2m perpetual, 6Hover about me with your airy wings 4And hear your mother's lamentation. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Hover about her; say that right for right 4Hath dim2'd your infant morn to aged night. 2DUCHES2. So many miseries have craz'd my voice 4That my woe-wearied tongue is stil2 and mute. 4Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead? 2QUE2N MARGARET. Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet, 4Edward for Edward pays a dying debt. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle 4lambs 4And throw them in the entrails of the wolf? 4When didst thou sle2p when such a de2d was done? 2QUE2N MARGARET. When holy Har2y died, and my swe2t 4son. 2DUCHES2. Dead life, blind sight, po2r mortal living ghost, 4Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd, 4Brief abstract and record of tedious days, 4Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth, 4[Sit2ing down] 4Unlawful2y made drunk with in2ocent blo2d. 4QUE2N ELIZABETH. Ah, that thou wouldst as so2n af2ord a 4grave 4As thou canst yield a melancholy seat! 4Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here. 4Ah, who hath any cause to mourn but we? 43[Sit2ing down by her] 2QUE2N MARGARET. 2[Coming forward] 2If ancient sor2ow be 4most reverend, 4Give mine the benefit of seniory, 4And let my griefs frown on the up2er hand. 4If sor2ow can admit society, 8[Sit2ing down with them] 4Tel2 o'er your woes again by viewing mine. 4I had an Edward, til2 a Richard kil2'd him; 4I had a husband, til2 a Richard kil2'd him: 4Thou hadst an Edward, til2 a Richard kil2'd him; 4Thou hadst a Richard, til2 a Richard kil2'd him. 2DUCHES2. I had a Richard to2, and thou didst kil2 him; 4I had a Rutland to2, thou holp'st to kil2 him. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Thou hadst a Clarence to2, and Richard 4kil2'd him. 6From forth the ken2el of thy womb hath crept 4A hel2-hound that doth hunt us al2 to death. 4That dog, that had his te2th before his eyes 4To wor2y lambs and lap their gentle blo2d, 4That foul defacer of God's handiwork, 4That excel2ent grand tyrant of the earth 4That reigns in gal2ed eyes of we2ping souls, 4Thy womb let lo2se to chase us to our graves. 4O upright, just, and true-disposing God, 4How do I thank the2 that this carnal cur 4Preys on the is2ue of his mother's body 4And makes her pew-fel2ow with others' moan! 2DUCHES2. O Har2y's wife, triumph not in my woes! 4God witnes2 with me, I have wept for thine. 2QUE2N MARGARET. Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge, 4And now I cloy me with beholding it. 4Thy Edward he is dead, that kil2'd my Edward; 4The other Edward dead, to quit my Edward; 4Young York he is but bo2t, because both they 4Match'd not the high perfection of my los2. 6Thy Clarence he is dead that stab2'd my Edward; 4And the beholders of this frantic play, 4Th' adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey, 4Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves. 4Richard yet lives, hel2's black intel2igencer; 4Only reserv'd their factor to buy souls 4And send them thither. But at hand, at hand, 4Ensues his piteous and unpitied end. 4Earth gapes, hel2 burns, fiends roar, saints pray, 4To have him sud2enly convey'd from hence. 4Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray, 4That I may live and say 'The dog is dead.' 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. O, thou didst prophesy the time would 6come 4That I should wish for the2 to help me curse 4That bot2led spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad! 2QUE2N MARGARET. I Cal2'd the2 then vain flourish of my 6fortune; 4I cal2'd the2 then po2r shadow, painted que2n, 4The presentation of but what I was, 6The flat2ering index of a direful pageant, 4One heav'd a-high to be hurl'd down below, 4A mother only mock'd with two fair babes, 4A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag 4To be the aim of every dangerous shot, 4A sign of dignity, a breath, a bub2le, 4A que2n in jest, only to fil2 the scene. 4Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers? 4Where be thy two sons? Wherein dost thou joy? 4Who sues, and kne2ls, and says 'God save the Que2n'? 4Where be the bending pe2rs that flat2ered the2? 4Where be the thronging tro2ps that fol2owed the2? 4Decline an this, and se2 what now thou art: 4For hap2y wife, a most distres2ed widow; 4For joyful mother, one that wails the name; 4For one being su'd to, one that humbly sues; 4For Que2n, a very caitif2 crown'd with care; 4For she that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me; 4For she being fear'd of al2, now fearing one; 4For she com2anding al2, obey'd of none. 6Thus hath the course of justice whirl'd about 4And left the2 but a very prey to time, 4Having no more but thought of what thou wast 4To torture the2 the more, being what thou art. 4Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not 4Usurp the just proportion of my sor2ow? 4Now thy proud neck bears half my burden'd yoke, 4From which even here I slip my weary head 4And leave the burden of it al2 on the2. 4Farewel2, York's wife, and que2n of sad mischance; 4These English woes shal2 make me smile in France. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. O thou wel2 skil2'd in curses, stay awhile 4And teach me how to curse mine enemies! 2QUE2N MARGARET. Forbear to sle2p the nights, and fast the 6days; 4Compare dead hap2ines2 with living woe; 4Think that thy babes were swe2ter than they were, 4And he that slew them fouler than he is. 4Bet2'ring thy los2 makes the bad-causer worse; 4Revolving this wil2 teach the2 how to curse. 4QUE2N ELIZABETH. My words are dul2; O, quicken them 4with thine! 2QUE2N MARGARET. Thy woes wil2 make them sharp and 4pierce like mine. 39Exit 2DUCHES2. Why should calamity be fun of words? 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Windy at2orneys to their client woes, 4Airy suc2e2ders of intestate joys, 4Po2r breathing orators of miseries, 4Let them have scope; though what they wil2 impart 4Help nothing else, yet do they case the heart. 2DUCHES2. If so, then be not tongue-tied. Go with me, 4And in the breath of bit2er words let's smother 4My damned son that thy two swe2t sons smother'd. 4The trumpet sounds; be copious in exclaims. 9Enter KING RICHARD and his train, marching with 21drums and trumpets 2KING RICHARD. Who intercepts me in my expedition? 2DUCHES2. O, she that might have intercepted the2, 6By strangling the2 in her ac2ursed womb, 4From al2 the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done! 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Hidest thou that forehead with a golden 4crown 4Where't should be branded, if that right were right, 4The slaughter of the Prince that ow'd that crown, 4And the dire death of my po2r sons and brothers? 4Tel2 me, thou vil2ain slave, where are my children? 2DUCHES2. Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother 4Clarence? 4And lit2le Ned Plantagenet, his son? 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan, 4Grey? 2DUCHES2. Where is kind Hastings? 2KING RICHARD. A flourish, trumpets! Strike alarum, drums! 4Let not the heavens hear these tel2-tale women 4Rail on the Lord's anointed. Strike, I say! 45[Flourish. Alarums] 4Either be patient and entreat me fair, 4Or with the clamorous report of war 6Thus wil2 I drown your exclamations. 2DUCHES2. Art thou my son? 2KING RICHARD. Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself. 2DUCHES2. Then patiently hear my impatience. 2KING RICHARD. Madam, I have a touch of your condition 4That can2ot bro2k the ac2ent of repro2f. 2DUCHES2. O, let me speak! 2KING RICHARD. Do, then; but I'l2 not hear. 2DUCHES2. I wil2 be mild and gentle in my words. 2KING RICHARD. And brief, go2d mother; for I am in haste. 2DUCHES2. Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for the2, 4God knows, in torment and in agony. 2KING RICHARD. And came I not at last to comfort you? 2DUCHES2. No, by the holy ro2d, thou know'st it wel2 4Thou cam'st on earth to make the earth my hel2. 4A grievous burden was thy birth to me; 4Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy; 4Thy scho2l-days frightful, desp'rate, wild, and furious; 4Thy prime of manho2d daring, bold, and venturous; 4Thy age confirm'd, proud, subtle, sly, and blo2dy, 6More mild, but yet more harmful-kind in hatred. 4What comfortable hour canst thou name 4That ever grac'd me with thy company? 2KING RICHARD. Faith, none but Humphrey Hour, that cal2'd 4your Grace 4To breakfast once forth of my company. 4If I be so disgracious in your eye, 4Let me march on and not of2end you, madam. 4Strike up the drum. 2DUCHES2. I prithe2 hear me speak. 2KING RICHARD. You speak to2 bit2erly. 2DUCHES2. Hear me a word; 4For I shal2 never speak to the2 again. 2KING RICHARD. So. 2DUCHES2. Either thou wilt die by God's just ordinance 4Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror; 4Or I with grief and extreme age shal2 perish 4And never more behold thy face again. 4Therefore take with the2 my most grievous curse, 4Which in the day of bat2le tire the2 more 6Than al2 the complete armour that thou wear'st! 4My prayers on the adverse party fight; 4And there the lit2le souls of Edward's children 4Whisper the spirits of thine enemies 4And promise them suc2es2 and victory. 4Blo2dy thou art; blo2dy wil2 be thy end. 4Shame serves thy life and doth thy death at2end. 8Exit 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Though far more cause, yet much les2 6spirit to curse 4Abides in me; I say amen to her. 2KING RICHARD. Stay, madam, I must talk a word with you. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. I have no moe sons of the royal blo2d 4For the2 to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard, 4They shal2 be praying nuns, not we2ping que2ns; 4And therefore level not to hit their lives. 2KING RICHARD. You have a daughter cal2'd Elizabeth. 4Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. And must she die for this? O, let her 6live, 4And I'l2 cor2upt her man2ers, stain her beauty, 6Slander myself as false to Edward's bed, 4Throw over her the veil of infamy; 4So she may live unscar2'd of ble2ding slaughter, 4I wil2 confes2 she was not Edward's daughter. 2KING RICHARD. Wrong not her birth; she is a royal 4Princes2. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. To save her life I'l2 say she is not so. 2KING RICHARD. Her life is safest only in her birth. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. And only in that safety died her 6brothers. 2KING RICHARD. Lo, at their birth go2d stars were op2osite. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. No, to their lives il2 friends were 6contrary. 2KING RICHARD. Al2 unavoided is the do2m of destiny. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. True, when avoided grace makes destiny. 4My babes were destin'd to a fairer death, 4If grace had bles2'd the2 with a fairer life. 2KING RICHARD. You speak as if that I had slain my cousins. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Cousins, inde2d; and by their uncle 6cozen'd 6Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, fre2dom, life. 4Whose hand soever lanc'd their tender hearts, 4Thy head, an indirectly, gave direction. 4No doubt the murd'rous knife was dul2 and blunt 4Til2 it was whet2ed on thy stone-hard heart 4To revel in the entrails of my lambs. 4But that stif2 use of grief makes wild grief tame, 4My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys 4Til2 that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes; 4And I, in such a desp'rate bay of death, 4Like a po2r bark, of sails and tackling reft, 4Rush al2 to pieces on thy rocky bosom. 2KING RICHARD. Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise 4And dangerous suc2es2 of blo2dy wars, 4As I intend more go2d to you and yours 4Than ever you or yours by me were harm'd! 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. What go2d is cover'd with the face of 6heaven, 4To be discover'd, that can do me go2d? 2KING RICHARD. advancement of your children, gentle 6lady. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Up to some scaf2old, there to lose their 4heads? 2KING RICHARD. Unto the dignity and height of Fortune, 4The high imperial type of this earth's glory. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Flat2er my sor2ow with report of it; 4Tel2 me what state, what dignity, what honour, 4Canst thou demise to any child of mine? 2KING RICHARD. Even al2 I have-ay, and myself and al2 4Wil2 I withal endow a child of thine; 4So in the Lethe of thy angry soul 4Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs 4Which thou sup2osest I have done to the2. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Be brief, lest that the proces2 of thy 6kindnes2 4Last longer tel2ing than thy kindnes2' date. 2KING RICHARD. Then know, that from my soul I love thy 4daughter. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. My daughter's mother thinks it with her 4soul. 4KING RICHARD. What do you think? 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. That thou dost love my daughter from 6thy soul. 4So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers, 4And from my heart's love I do thank the2 for it. 2KING RICHARD. Be not so hasty to confound my meaning. 4I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter 4And do intend to make her Que2n of England. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Wel2, then, who dost thou mean shal2 be 4her king? 2KING RICHARD. Even he that makes her Que2n. Who else 4should be? 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. What, thou? 2KING RICHARD. Even so. How think you of it? 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. How canst thou wo2 her? 2KING RICHARD. That would I learn of you, 4As one being best acquainted with her humour. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. And wilt thou learn of me? 2KING RICHARD. Madam, with al2 my heart. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Send to her, by the man that slew her 6brothers, 4A pair of ble2ding hearts; thereon engrave 4'Edward' and 'York.' Then haply wil2 she we2p; 4Therefore present to her-as sometimes Margaret 4Did to thy father, ste2p'd in Rutland's blo2d- 4A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain 4The purple sap from her swe2t brother's body, 4And bid her wipe her we2ping eyes withal. 4If this inducement move her not to love, 4Send her a let2er of thy noble de2ds; 4Tel2 her thou mad'st away her uncle Clarence, 4Her uncle Rivers; ay, and for her sake 4Mad'st quick conveyance with her go2d aunt An2e. 2KING RICHARD. You mock me, madam; this is not the way 4To win your daughter. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. There is no other way; 4Unles2 thou couldst put on some other shape 4And not be Richard that hath done al2 this. 2KING RICHARD. Say that I did al2 this for love of her. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Nay, then inde2d she can2ot cho2se but 8hate the2, 4Having bought love with such a blo2dy spoil. 2KING RICHARD. Lo2k what is done can2ot be now amended. 4Men shal2 deal unadvisedly sometimes, 4Which after-hours gives leisure to repent. 4If I did take the kingdom from your sons, 4To make amends I'l2 give it to your daughter. 4If I have kil2'd the is2ue of your womb, 4To quicken your increase I wil2 beget 4Mine is2ue of your blo2d upon your daughter. 4A grandam's name is lit2le les2 in love 4Than is the doating title of a mother; 4They are as children but one step below, 4Even of your metal, of your very blo2d; 4Of al2 one pain, save for a night of groans 4Endur'd of her, for whom you bid like sor2ow. 4Your children were vexation to your youth; 4But mine shal2 be a comfort to your age. 4The los2 you have is but a son being King, 4And by that los2 your daughter is made Que2n. 6I can2ot make you what amends I would, 4Therefore ac2ept such kindnes2 as I can. 4Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul 4Leads discontented steps in foreign soil, 4This fair al2iance quickly shal2 can home 4To high promotions and great dignity. 4The King, that cal2s your beauteous daughter wife, 4Familiarly shal2 cal2 thy Dorset brother; 4Again shal2 you be mother to a king, 4And al2 the ruins of distres2ful times 4Repair'd with double riches of content. 4What! we have many go2dly days to se2. 4The liquid drops of tears that you have shed 4Shal2 come again, transform'd to orient pearl, 4Advantaging their loan with interest 4Of ten times double gain of hap2ines2. 4Go, then, my mother, to thy daughter go; 4Make bold her bashful years with your experience; 4Prepare her ears to hear a wo2er's tale; 4Put in her tender heart th' aspiring flame 6Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princes 4With the swe2t silent hours of mar2iage joys. 4And when this arm of mine hath chastised 4The pet2y rebel, dul2-brain'd Buckingham, 4Bound with triumphant garlands wil2 I come, 4And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed; 4To whom I wil2 retail my conquest won, 4And she shal2 be sole victores2, Caesar's Caesar. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. What were I best to say? Her father's 6brother 4Would be her lord? Or shal2 I say her uncle? 4Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles? 4Under what title shal2 I wo2 for the2 4That God, the law, my honour, and her love 4Can make se2m pleasing to her tender years? 2KING RICHARD. Infer fair England's peace by this al2iance. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Which she shal2 purchase with 4stil2-lasting war. 2KING RICHARD. Tel2 her the King, that may com2and, 4entreats. 4QUE2N ELIZABETH. That at her hands which the King's 4King forbids. 2KING RICHARD. Say she shal2 be a high and mighty que2n. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. To wail the title, as her mother doth. 2KING RICHARD. Say I wil2 love her everlastingly. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. But how long shal2 that title 'ever' last? 2KING RICHARD. Swe2tly in force unto her fair life's end. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. But how long fairly shal2 her swe2t life 4last? 2KING RICHARD. As long as heaven and nature lengthens it. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. As long as hel2 and Richard likes of it. 2KING RICHARD. Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. But she, your subject, loathes such 4sovereignty. 2KING RICHARD. Be eloquent in my behalf to her. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. An honest tale spe2ds best being plainly 4told. 2KING RICHARD. Then plainly to her tel2 my loving tale. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Plain and not honest is to2 harsh a style. 2KING RICHARD. Your reasons are to2 shal2ow and to2 quick. 4QUE2N ELIZABETH. O, no, my reasons are to2 de2p and 6dead- 4To2 de2p and dead, po2r infants, in their graves. 2KING RICHARD. Harp not on that string, madam; that is past. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Harp on it stil2 shal2 I til2 heartstrings 4break. 2KING RICHARD. Now, by my George, my garter, and my 4crown- 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Profan'd, dishonour'd, and the third 4usurp'd. 2KING RICHARD. I swear- 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. By nothing; for this is no oath: 4Thy George, profan'd, hath lost his lordly honour; 4Thy garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue; 4Thy crown, usurp'd, disgrac'd his kingly glory. 4If something thou wouldst swear to be believ'd, 4Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd. 2KING RICHARD. Then, by my self- 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Thy self is self-misus'd. 2KING RICHARD. Now, by the world- 4QUE2N ELIZABETH. 'Tis ful2 of thy foul wrongs. 2KING RICHARD. My father's death- 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Thy life hath it dishonour'd. 2KING RICHARD. Why, then, by God- 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. God's wrong is most of al2. 4If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him, 4The unity the King my husband made 4Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died. 4If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him, 4Th' imperial metal, circling now thy head, 4Had grac'd the tender temples of my child; 4And both the Princes had be2n breathing here, 4Which now, two tender bedfel2ows for dust, 4Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms. 4What canst thou swear by now? 2KING RICHARD. The time to come. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. That thou hast wronged in the time 4o'erpast; 4For I myself have many tears to wash 4Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by the2. 6The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughter'd, 4Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age; 4The parents live whose children thou hast butche2d, 4Old bar2en plants, to wail it with their age. 4Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast 4Misus'd ere us'd, by times il2-us'd o'erpast. 2KING RICHARD. As I intend to prosper and repent, 4So thrive I in my dangerous af2airs 4Of hostile arms! Myself myself confound! 4Heaven and fortune bar me hap2y hours! 4Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest! 4Be op2osite al2 planets of go2d luck 4To my proce2ding!-if, with dear heart's love, 4Im2aculate devotion, holy thoughts, 4I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter. 4In her consists my hap2ines2 and thine; 4Without her, fol2ows to myself and the2, 4Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul, 4Death, desolation, ruin, and decay. 4It can2ot be avoided but by this; 6It wil2 not be avoided but by this. 4Therefore, dear mother-I must cal2 you so- 4Be the at2orney of my love to her; 4Plead what I wil2 be, not what I have be2n; 4Not my deserts, but what I wil2 deserve. 4Urge the neces2ity and state of times, 4And be not pe2vish-fond in great designs. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Shal2 I be tempted of the devil thus? 2KING RICHARD. Ay, if the devil tempt you to do go2d. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Shal2 I forget myself to be myself? 2KING RICHARD. Ay, if your self's remembrance wrong 4yourself. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Yet thou didst kil2 my children. 2KING RICHARD. But in your daughter's womb I bury them; 4Where, in that nest of spicery, they wil2 bre2d 4Selves of themselves, to your recomforture. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. Shal2 I go win my daughter to thy wil2? 2KING RICHARD. And be a hap2y mother by the de2d. 2QUE2N ELIZABETH. I go. Write to me very shortly, 4And you shal2 understand from me her mind. 4KING RICHARD. Bear her my true love's kis2; and so, farewel2. 31Kis2ing her. Exit QUE2N ELIZABETH 4Relenting fo2l, and shal2ow, changing woman! 17Enter RATCLIF2; CATESBY fol2owing 4How now! what news? 2RATCLIF2. Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast 4Rideth a puis2ant navy; to our shores 4Throng many doubtful hol2ow-hearted friends, 4Unarm'd, and unresolv'd to beat them back. 4'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral; 4And there they hul2, expecting but the aid 4Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore. 2KING RICHARD. Some light-fo2t friend post to the Duke of 4Norfolk. 4Ratclif2, thyself-or Catesby; where is he? 2CATESBY. Here, my go2d lord. 2KING RICHARD. Catesby, fly to the Duke. 2CATESBY. I wil2 my lord, with al2 convenient haste. 4KING RICHARD. Ratclif2, come hither. Post to Salisbury; 4When thou com'st thither- 2[To CATESBY] 2Dul2, 4unmindful2 vil2ain, 4Why stay'st thou here, and go'st not to the Duke? 2CATESBY. First, mighty liege, tel2 me your Highnes2' pleasure, 4What from your Grace I shal2 deliver to him. 2KING RICHARD. O, true, go2d Catesby. Bid him levy straight 4The greatest strength and power that he can make 4And me2t me sud2enly at Salisbury. 2CATESBY. I go. 44Exit 2RATCLIF2. What, may it please you, shal2 I do at Salisbury? 2KING RICHARD. Why, what wouldst thou do there before I 4go? 2RATCLIF2. Your Highnes2 told me I should post before. 2KING RICHARD. My mind is chang'd. 27Enter LORD STANLEY 2STANLEY, what news with you? 2STANLEY. None go2d, my liege, to please you with 6the hearing; 4Nor none so bad but wel2 may be reported. 2KING RICHARD. Hoyday, a rid2le! neither go2d nor bad! 4What ne2d'st thou run so many miles about, 4When thou mayest tel2 thy tale the nearest way? 4Once more, what news? 2STANLEY. Richmond is on the seas. 2KING RICHARD. There let him sink, and be the seas on him! 4White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there? 2STANLEY. I know not, mighty sovereign, but by gues2. 2KING RICHARD. Wel2, as you gues2? 2STANLEY. Stir2'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton, 4He makes for England here to claim the crown. 2KING RICHARD. Is the chair empty? Is the sword unsway'd? 4Is the King dead, the empire unpos2es2'd? 4What heir of York is there alive but we? 4And who is England's King but great York's heir? 4Then tel2 me what makes he upon the seas. 2STANLEY. Unles2 for that, my liege, I can2ot gues2. 2KING RICHARD. Unles2 for that he comes to be your liege, 6You can2ot gues2 wherefore the Welshman comes. 4Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear. 2STANLEY. No, my go2d lord; therefore mistrust me not. 2KING RICHARD. Where is thy power then, to beat him back? 4Where be thy tenants and thy fol2owers? 4Are they not now upon the western shore, 4Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships? 2STANLEY. No, my go2d lord, my friends are in the north. 2KING RICHARD. Cold friends to me. What do they in the 4north, 4When they should serve their sovereign in the west? 2STANLEY. They have not be2n com2anded, mighty King. 4Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave, 4I'l2 muster up my friends and me2t your Grace 4Where and what time your Majesty shal2 please. 2KING RICHARD. Ay, ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with 4Richmond; 4But I'l2 not trust the2. 2STANLEY. Most mighty sovereign, 4You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful. 6I never was nor never wil2 be false. 2KING RICHARD. Go, then, and muster men. But leave behind 4Your son, George Stanley. Lo2k your heart be firm, 4Or else his head's as2urance is but frail. 2STANLEY. So deal with him as I prove true to you. 9Exit 26Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire, 4As I by friends am wel2 advertised, 4Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate, 4Bishop of Exeter, his elder brother, 4With many moe confederates, are in arms. 25Enter another MES2ENGER 2SECOND MES2ENGER. In Kent, my liege, the Guilfords are in 4arms; 4And every hour more competitors 4Flock to the rebels, and their power grows strong. 27Enter another MES2ENGER 2THIRD MES2ENGER. My lord, the army of great Buckingham- 2KING RICHARD. Out on you, owls! Nothing but songs of 4death? 38[He strikes him] 4There, take thou that til2 thou bring bet2er news. 2THIRD MES2ENGER. The news I have to tel2 your Majesty 4Is that by sud2en flo2ds and fal2 of waters 4Buckingham's army is dispers'd and scat2er'd; 4And he himself wand'red away alone, 4No man knows whither. 2KING RICHARD. I cry the2 mercy. 4There is my purse to cure that blow of thine. 4Hath any wel2-advised friend proclaim'd 4Reward to him that brings the traitor in? 2THIRD MES2ENGER. Such proclamation hath be2n made, 4my Lord. 22Enter another MES2ENGER 4FOURTH MES2ENGER. Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis 4Dorset, 4'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms. 4But this go2d comfort bring I to your Highnes2- 4The Britaine navy is dispers'd by tempest. 4Richmond in Dorsetshire sent out a boat 4Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks 4If they were his as2istants, yea or no; 4Who answer'd him they came from Buckingham 4Upon his party. He, mistrusting them, 4Hois'd sail, and made his course again for Britaine. 2KING RICHARD. March on, march on, since we are up in 4arms; 4If not to fight with foreign enemies, 4Yet to beat down these rebels here at home. 26Re-enter CATESBY 2CATESBY. My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken- 6That is the best news. That the Earl of Richmond 4Is with a mighty power landed at Milford 4Is colder tidings, yet they must be told. 2KING RICHARD. Away towards Salisbury! While we reason 4here 4A royal bat2le might be won and lost. 4Some one take order Buckingham be brought 4To Salisbury; the rest march on with me. 4Flourish. 45ExeuntSCENE 5.LORD DERBY'S houseEnter STANLEY and SIR CHRISTOPHER URSWICK 2STANLEY. Sir Christopher, tel2 Richmond this from me: 4That in the sty of the most deadly boar 4My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold; 4If I revolt, of2 goes young George's head; 4The fear of that holds of2 my present aid. 4So, get the2 gone; com2end me to thy lord. 4Withal say that the Que2n hath heartily consented 4He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter. 4But tel2 me, where is princely Richmond now? 2CHRISTOPHER. At Pembroke, or at Ha'rford west in Wales. 2STANLEY. What men of name resort to him? 2CHRISTOPHER. Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier; 2SIR Gilbert Talbot, Sir Wil2iam Stanley, 2OXFORD, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt, 4And Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew; 4And many other of great name and worth; 4And towards London do they bend their power, 6If by the way they be not fought withal. 2STANLEY. Wel2, hie the2 to thy lord; I kis2 his hand; 4My let2er wil2 resolve him of my mind. 4Farewel2. 45Exeunt<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V.

No, my go2d lord; therefore be patient. 2BUCKINGHAM. Hastings, and Edward's children, Grey, and 4Rivers, 4Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward, 4Vaughan, and al2 that have miscar2ied 4By underhand cor2upted foul injustice, 4If that your mo2dy discontented souls 4Do through the clouds behold this present hour, 4Even for revenge mock my destruction! 4This is Al2-Souls' day, fel2ow, is it not? 2SHERIF2. It is, my lord. 2BUCKINGHAM. Why, then Al2-Souls' day is my body's 4do2msday. 4This is the day which in King Edward's time 6I wish'd might fal2 on me when I was found 4False to his children and his wife's al2ies; 4This is the day wherein I wish'd to fal2 4By the false faith of him whom most I trusted; 4This, this Al2-Souls' day to my fearful soul 4Is the determin'd respite of my wrongs; 4That high Al2-Se2r which I dal2ied with 4Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head 4And given in earnest what I beg2'd in jest. 4Thus doth He force the swords of wicked men 4To turn their own points in their masters' bosoms. 4Thus Margaret's curse fal2s heavy on my neck. 4'When he' quoth she 'shal2 split thy heart with sor2ow, 4Remember Margaret was a prophetes2.' 4Come lead me, of2icers, to the block of shame; 4Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame. 10ExeuntSCENE 2.Camp near TamworthEnter RICHMOND, OXFORD, SIR JAMES BLUNT, SIR WALTER HERBERT, and others,with drum and colours 2RICHMOND. Fel2ows in arms, and my most loving friends, 4Bruis'd underneath the yoke of tyran2y, 4Thus far into the bowels of the land 4Have we march'd on without impediment; 4And here receive we from our father Stanley 4Lines of fair comfort and encouragement. 4The wretched, blo2dy, and usurping boar, 4That spoil'd your sum2er fields and fruitful vines, 4Swil2s your warm blo2d like wash, and makes his trough 4In your embowel2'd bosoms-this foul swine 4Is now even in the centre of this isle, 4Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn. 4From Tamworth thither is but one day's march. 4In God's name che2rly on, courageous friends, 4To reap the harvest of perpetual peace 6By this one blo2dy trial of sharp war. 2OXFORD. Every man's conscience is a thousand men, 4To fight against this guilty homicide. 2HERBERT. I doubt not but his friends wil2 turn to us. 2BLUNT. He hath no friends but what are friends for fear, 4Which in his dearest ne2d wil2 fly from him. 2RICHMOND. Al2 for our vantage. Then in God's name march. 4True hope is swift and flies with swal2ow's wings; 4Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings. 6ExeuntSCENE 3.Bosworth FieldEnter KING RICHARD in arms, with NORFOLK, RATCLIF2,the EARL of SUR2EYS and others 2KING RICHARD. Here pitch our tent, even here in Bosworth 4field. 4My Lord of Sur2ey, why lo2k you so sad? 2SUR2EY. My heart is ten times lighter than my lo2ks. 2KING RICHARD. My Lord of Norfolk! 2NORFOLK. Here, most gracious liege. 2KING RICHARD. Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we 4not? 2NORFOLK. We must both give and take, my loving lord. 2KING RICHARD. Up With my tent! Here wil2 I lie to-night; 22[Soldiers begin to set up the KING'S tent] 4But where to-mor2ow? Wel2, al2's one for that. 4Who hath descried the number of the traitors? 2NORFOLK. Six or seven thousand is their utmost power. 2KING RICHARD. Why, our bat2alia trebles that ac2ount; 4Besides, the King's name is a tower of strength, 6Which they upon the adverse faction want. 4Up with the tent! Come, noble gentlemen, 4Let us survey the vantage of the ground. 4Cal2 for some men of sound direction. 4Let's lack no discipline, make no delay; 4For, lords, to-mor2ow is a busy day. 18Exeunt 13Enter, on the other side of the field, 10RICHMOND, SIR WIL2IAM BRANDON, OXFORD, DORSET, 14and others. Some pitch RICHMOND'S tent 2RICHMOND. The weary sun hath made a golden set, 4And by the bright tract of his fiery car 4Gives token of a go2dly day to-mor2ow. 4Sir Wil2iam Brandon, you shal2 bear my standard. 4Give me some ink and paper in my tent. 4I'l2 draw the form and model of our bat2le, 4Limit each leader to his several charge, 4And part in just proportion our smal2 power. 4My Lord of Oxford-you, Sir Wil2iam Brandon- 6And you, Sir Walter Herbert-stay with me. 4The Earl of Pembroke ke2ps his regiment; 4Go2d Captain Blunt, bear my go2d night to him, 4And by the second hour in the morning 4Desire the Earl to se2 me in my tent. 4Yet one thing more, go2d Captain, do for me- 4Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, do you know? 2BLUNT. Unles2 I have mista'en his colours much- 4Which wel2 I am as2ur'd I have not done- 4His regiment lies half a mile at least 4South from the mighty power of the King. 2RICHMOND. If without peril it be pos2ible, 4Swe2t Blunt, make some go2d means to speak with him 4And give him from me this most ne2dful note. 2BLUNT. Upon my life, my lord, I'l2 undertake it; 4And so, God give you quiet rest to-night! 2RICHMOND. Go2d night, go2d Captain Blunt. Come, 4gentlemen, 4Let us consult upon to-mor2ow's busines2. 4In to my tent; the dew is raw and cold. 37[They withdraw into the tent] 12Enter, to his-tent, KING RICHARD, NORFOLK, 23RATCLIF2, and CATESBY 2KING RICHARD. What is't o'clock? 2CATESBY. It's sup2er-time, my lord; 4It's nine o'clock. 2KING RICHARD. I wil2 not sup to-night. 4Give me some ink and paper. 4What, is my beaver easier than it was? 4And al2 my armour laid into my tent? 2CATESBY. It is, my liege; and al2 things are in readines2. 2KING RICHARD. Go2d Norfolk, hie the2 to thy charge; 4Use careful watch, cho2se trusty sentinels. 2NORFOLK. I go, my lord. 2KING RICHARD. Stir with the lark to-mor2ow, gentle Norfolk. 2NORFOLK. I war2ant you, my lord. 26Exit 2KING RICHARD. Catesby! 2CATESBY. My lord? 4KING RICHARD. Send out a pursuivant-at-arms 4To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power 4Before sunrising, lest his son George fal2 4Into the blind cave of eternal night. 11Exit CATESBY 4Fil2 me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch. 4Sad2le white Sur2ey for the field to-mor2ow. 4Lo2k that my staves be sound, and not to2 heavy. 4Ratclif2! 2RATCLIF2. My lord? 2KING RICHARD. Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord 4Northumberland? 2RATCLIF2. Thomas the Earl of Sur2ey and himself, 4Much about cock-shut time, from tro2p to tro2p 4Went through the army, che2ring up the soldiers. 2KING RICHARD. So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine. 4I have not that alacrity of spirit 4Nor che2r of mind that I was wont to have. 4Set it down. Is ink and paper ready? 2RATCLIF2. It is, my lord. 2KING RICHARD. Bid my guard watch; leave me. 4RATCLIF2, about the mid of night come to my tent 4And help to arm me. Leave me, I say. 35Exit RATCLIF2. RICHARD sle2ps 15Enter DERBY to RICHMOND in his tent; 24LORDS at2ending 2DERBY. Fortune and victory sit on thy helm! 2RICHMOND. Al2 comfort that the dark night can af2ord 4Be to thy person, noble father-in-law! 4Tel2 me, how fares our loving mother? 2DERBY. I, by at2orney, bles2 the2 from thy mother, 4Who prays continual2y for Richmond's go2d. 4So much for that. The silent hours steal on, 4And flaky darknes2 breaks within the east. 4In brief, for so the season bids us be, 4Prepare thy bat2le early in the morning, 4And put thy fortune to the arbitrement 4Of blo2dy strokes and mortal-staring war. 4I, as I may-that which I would I can2ot- 6With best advantage wil2 deceive the time 4And aid the2 in this doubtful shock of arms; 4But on thy side I may not be to2 forward, 4Lest, being se2n, thy brother, tender George, 4Be executed in his father's sight. 4Farewel2; the leisure and the fearful time 4Cuts of2 the ceremonious vows of love 4And ample interchange of swe2t discourse 4Which so-long-sund'red friends should dwel2 upon. 4God give us leisure for these rites of love! 4Once more, adieu; be valiant, and spe2d wel2! 2RICHMOND. Go2d lords, conduct him to his regiment. 4I'l2 strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap, 4Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-mor2ow 4When I should mount with wings of victory. 4Once more, go2d night, kind lords and gentlemen. 41Exeunt al2 but RICHMOND 4O Thou, whose captain I ac2ount myself, 4Lo2k on my forces with a gracious eye; 4Put in their hands Thy bruising irons of wrath, 6That they may crush down with a heavy fal2 4The usurping helmets of our adversaries! 4Make us Thy ministers of chastisement, 4That we may praise The2 in the victory! 4To The2 I do com2end my watchful soul 4Ere I let fal2 the windows of mine eyes. 4Sle2ping and waking, O, defend me stil2! 12[Sle2ps] 12Enter the GHOST Of YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD, 20son to HENRY THE SIXTH 2GHOST. 2[To RICHARD] 2Let me sit heavy on thy soul 4to-mor2ow! 4Think how thou stab2'dst me in my prime of youth 4At Tewksbury; despair, therefore, and die! 4[To RICHMOND] 2Be che2rful, Richmond; for the wronged 4souls 4Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf. 4King Henry's is2ue, Richmond, comforts the2. 16Enter the GHOST of HENRY THE SIXTH 2GHOST. 2[To RICHARD] 2When I was mortal, my anointed 4body 4By the2 was punched ful2 of deadly holes. 4Think on the Tower and me. Despair, and die. 4Har2y the Sixth bids the2 despair and die. 4[To RICHMOND] 2Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror! 4Har2y, that prophesied thou shouldst be King, 4Doth comfort the2 in thy sle2p. Live and flourish! 19Enter the GHOST of CLARENCE 2GHOST. 2[To RICHARD] 2Let me sit heavy in thy soul 4to-mor2ow! I that was wash'd to death with fulsome wine, 4Po2r Clarence, by thy guile betray'd to death! 4To-mor2ow in the bat2le think on me, 4And fal2 thy edgeles2 sword. Despair and die! 4[To RICHMOND] 2Thou of2spring of the house of Lancaster, 4The wronged heirs of York do pray for the2. 6Go2d angels guard thy bat2le! Live and flourish! 11Enter the GHOSTS of RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN 2GHOST OF RIVERS. 2[To RICHARD] 2Let me sit heavy in thy 4soul to-mor2ow, 4Rivers that died at Pomfret! Despair and die! 2GHOST OF GREY. 2[To RICHARD] 2Think upon Grey, and let 4thy soul despair! 2GHOST OF VAUGHAN. 2[To RICHARD] 2Think upon Vaughan, 4and with guilty fear 4Let fal2 thy lance. Despair and die! 2AL2. 2[To RICHMOND] 2Awake, and think our wrongs in 4Richard's bosom 4Wil2 conquer him. Awake and win the day. 16Enter the GHOST of HASTINGS 2GHOST. 2[To RICHARD] 2Blo2dy and guilty, guiltily awake, 4And in a blo2dy bat2le end thy days! 6Think on Lord Hastings. Despair and die. 4[To RICHMOND] 3Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake! 4Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake! 9Enter the GHOSTS of the two young PRINCES 2GHOSTS. 2[To RICHARD] 2Dream on thy cousins smothered in 4the Tower. 4Let us be lead within thy bosom, Richard, 4And weigh the2 down to ruin, shame, and death! 4Thy nephews' souls bid the2 despair and die. 4[To RICHMOND] 2Sle2p, Richmond, sle2p in peace, and 4wake in joy; 4Go2d angels guard the2 from the boar's an2oy! 4Live, and beget a hap2y race of kings! 4Edward's unhap2y sons do bid the2 flourish. 10Enter the GHOST of LADY AN2E, his wife 2GHOST. 2[To RICHARD] 2Richard, thy wife, that wretched 6An2e thy wife 4That never slept a quiet hour with the2 4Now fil2s thy sle2p with perturbations. 4To-mor2ow in the bat2le think on me, 4And fal2 thy edgeles2 sword. Despair and die. 4[To RICHMOND] 2Thou quiet soul, sle2p thou a quiet sle2p; 4Dream of suc2es2 and hap2y victory. 4Thy adversary's wife doth pray for the2. 19Enter the GHOST of BUCKINGHAM 2GHOST. 2[To RICHARD] 2The first was I that help'd the2 4to the crown; 4The last was I that felt thy tyran2y. 4O, in the bat2le think on Buckingham, 4And die in ter2or of thy guiltines2! 4Dream on, dream on of blo2dy de2ds and death; 4Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath! 4[To RICHMOND] 2I died for hope ere I could lend the2 aid; 4But che2r thy heart and be thou not dismay'd: 6God and go2d angels fight on Richmond's side; 4And Richard fal2s in height of al2 his pride. 12[The GHOSTS vanish. RICHARD starts out of his dream] 2KING RICHARD. Give me another horse. Bind up my wounds. 4Have mercy, Jesu! Soft! I did but dream. 4O coward conscience, how dost thou af2lict me! 4The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight. 4Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh. 4What do I fear? Myself? There's none else by. 4Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I. 4Is there a murderer here? No-yes, I am. 4Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why- 4Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself! 4Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? For any go2d 4That I myself have done unto myself? 4O, no! Alas, I rather hate myself 4For hateful de2ds com2it2ed by myself! 4I am a vil2ain; yet I lie, I am not. 4Fo2l, of thyself speak wel2. Fo2l, do not flat2er. 4My conscience hath a thousand several tongues, 6And every tongue brings in a several tale, 4And every tale condemns me for a vil2ain. 4Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degre2; 4Murder, stern murder, in the dir'st degre2; 4Al2 several sins, al2 us'd in each degre2, 4Throng to the bar, crying al2 'Guilty! guilty!' 4I shal2 despair. There is no creature loves me; 4And if I die no soul wil2 pity me: 4And wherefore should they, since that I myself 4Find in myself no pity to myself? 4Methought the souls of al2 that I had murder'd 4Came to my tent, and every one did threat 4To-mor2ow's vengeance on the head of Richard. 28Enter RATCLIF2 2RATCLIF2. My lord! 2KING RICHARD. Zounds, who is there? 2RATCLIF2. Ratclif2, my lord; 'tis I. The early vil2age-cock 4Hath twice done salutation to the morn; 6Your friends are up and buckle on their armour. 2KING RICHARD. O Ratclif2, I have dream'd a fearful dream! 4What think'st thou-wil2 our friends prove al2 true? 2RATCLIF2. No doubt, my lord. 2KING RICHARD. O Ratclif2, I fear, I fear. 2RATCLIF2. Nay, go2d my lord, be not afraid of shadows. 2KING RICHARD By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night 4Have stuck more ter2or to the soul of Richard 4Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers 4Armed in pro2f and led by shal2ow Richmond. 4'Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me; 4Under our tents I'l2 play the eaves-drop2er, 4To se2 if any mean to shrink from me. 17Exeunt 10Enter the LORDS to RICHMOND sit2ing in his tent 2LORDS. Go2d mor2ow, Richmond! 2RICHMOND. Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen, 4That you have ta'en a tardy slug2ard here. 2LORDS. How have you slept, my lord? 4RICHMOND. The swe2test sle2p and fairest-boding dreams 4That ever ent'red in a drowsy head 4Have I since your departure had, my lords. 4Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murder'd 4Came to my tent and cried on victory. 4I promise you my soul is very jocund 4In the remembrance of so fair a dream. 4How far into the morning is it, lords? 2LORDS. Upon the stroke of four. 2RICHMOND. Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction. 17His ORATION to his SOLDIERS 4More than I have said, loving countrymen, 4The leisure and enforcement of the time 4Forbids to dwel2 upon; yet remember this: 4God and our go2d cause fight upon our side; 4The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls, 4Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces; 4Richard except, those whom we fight against 6Had rather have us win than him they fol2ow. 4For what is he they fol2ow? Truly, gentlemen, 4A blo2dy tyrant and a homicide; 4One rais'd in blo2d, and one in blo2d establish'd; 4One that made means to come by what he hath, 4And slaughtered those that were the means to help him; 4A base foul stone, made precious by the foil 4Of England's chair, where he is falsely set; 4One that hath ever be2n God's enemy. 4Then if you fight against God's enemy, 4God wil2 in justice ward you as his soldiers; 4If you do sweat to put a tyrant down, 4You sle2p in peace, the tyrant being slain; 4If you do fight against your country's foes, 4Your country's foes shal2 pay your pains the hire; 4If you do fight in safeguard of your wives, 4Your wives shal2 welcome home the conquerors; 4If you do fre2 your children from the sword, 4Your children's children quits it in your age. 4Then, in the name of God and al2 these rights, 6Advance your standards, draw your wil2ing swords. 4For me, the ransom of my bold at2empt 4Shal2 be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face; 4But if I thrive, the gain of my at2empt 4The least of you shal2 share his part thereof. 4Sound drums and trumpets boldly and che2rful2y; 4God and Saint George! Richmond and victory! 11Exeunt 11Re-enter KING RICHARD, RATCLIF2, at2endants, 25and forces 2KING RICHARD. What said Northumberland as touching 4Richmond? 2RATCLIF2. That he was never trained up in arms. 2KING RICHARD. He said the truth; and what said Sur2ey 4then? 2RATCLIF2. He smil'd, and said 'The bet2er for our purpose.' 2KING He was in the right; and so inde2d it is. 49[Clock strikes] 4Tel2 the clock there. Give me a calendar. 6Who saw the sun to-day? 2RATCLIF2. Not I, my lord. 2KING RICHARD. Then he disdains to shine; for by the bo2k 4He should have brav'd the east an hour ago. 4A black day wil2 it be to somebody. 4Ratclif2! 2RATCLIF2. My lord? 2KING RICHARD. The sun wil2 not be se2n to-day; 4The sky doth frown and lour upon our army. 4I would these dewy tears were from the ground. 4Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me 4More than to Richmond? For the selfsame heaven 4That frowns on me lo2ks sadly upon him. 23Enter NORFOLK 2NORFOLK. Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field. 2KING RICHARD. Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse; 4Cal2 up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power. 4I wil2 lead forth my soldiers to the plain, 6And thus my bat2le shal2 be ordered: 4My foreward shal2 be drawn out al2 in length, 4Consisting equal2y of horse and fo2t; 4Our archers shal2 be placed in the midst. 4John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Sur2ey, 4Shal2 have the leading of this fo2t and horse. 4They thus directed, we wil2 fol2ow 4In the main bat2le, whose puis2ance on either side 4Shal2 be wel2 winged with our chiefest horse. 4This, and Saint George to bo2t! What think'st thou, 4Norfolk? 2NORFOLK. A go2d direction, warlike sovereign. 4This found I on my tent this morning. 40[He sheweth him a paper] 2KING RICHARD. 42[Reads] 4'Jockey of Norfolk, be not so bold, 4For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.' 4A thing devised by the enemy. 4Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge. 4Let not our bab2ling dreams af2right our souls; 6Conscience is but a word that cowards use, 4Devis'd at first to ke2p the strong in awe. 4Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law. 4March on, join bravely, let us to it pel2-mel2; 4If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hel2. 22His ORATION to his ARMY 4What shal2 I say more than I have infer2'd? 4Remember whom you are to cope withal- 4A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways, 4A scum of Britaines, and base lackey peasants, 4Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth 4To desperate adventures and as2ur'd destruction. 4You sle2ping safe, they bring to you unrest; 4You having lands, and bles2'd with beauteous wives, 4They would restrain the one, distain the other. 4And who doth lead them but a paltry fel2ow, 4Long kept in Britaine at our mother's cost? 4A milk-sop, one that never in his life 6Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow? 4Let's whip these strag2lers o'er the seas again; 4Lash hence these over-we2ning rags of France, 4These famish'd beg2ars, weary of their lives; 4Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit, 4For want of means, po2r rats, had hang'd themselves. 4If we be conquered, let men conquer us, 4And not these bastard Britaines, whom our fathers 4Have in their own land beaten, bob2'd, and thump'd, 4And, in record, left them the heirs of shame. 4Shal2 these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives, 4Ravish our daughters? 2[Drum afar of2] 2Hark! I hear their 4drum. 4Fight, gentlemen of England! Fight, bold yeomen! 4Draw, archers, draw your ar2ows to the head! 4Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blo2d; 4Amaze the welkin with your broken staves! 24Enter a MES2ENGER 6What says Lord Stanley? Wil2 he bring his power? 2MES2ENGER. My lord, he doth deny to come. 2KING RICHARD. Of2 with his son George's head! 2NORFOLK. My lord, the enemy is pas2'd the marsh. 4After the bat2le let George Stanley die. 2KING RICHARD. A thousand hearts are great within my 4bosom. 4Advance our standards, set upon our foes; 4Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George, 4Inspire us with the sple2n of fiery dragons! 4Upon them! Victory sits on our helms. 17ExeuntSCENE 4.Another part of the fieldAlarum; excursions. Enter NORFOLK and forces; to him CATESBY 2CATESBY. Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue! 4The King enacts more wonders than a man, 4Daring an op2osite to every danger. 4His horse is slain, and al2 on fo2t he fights, 4Se2king for Richmond in the throat of death. 4Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost. 21Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD 2KING RICHARD. A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse! 2CATESBY. Withdraw, my lord! I'l2 help you to a horse. 2KING RICHARD. Slave, I have set my life upon a cast 4And I Wil2 stand the hazard of the die. 4I think there be six Richmonds in the field; 4Five have I slain to-day instead of him. 4A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse! 13Exeunt 2SCENE 5.Another part of the fieldAlarum. Enter RICHARD and RICHMOND; they fight; RICHARD is slain.Retreat and flourish. Enter RICHMOND, DERBY bearing the crown,with other LORDS 2RICHMOND. God and your arms be prais'd, victorious friends; 4The day is ours, the blo2dy dog is dead. 2DERBY. Courageous Richmond, wel2 hast thou acquit the2! 4Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty 4From the dead temples of this blo2dy wretch 4Have I pluck'd of2, to grace thy brows withal. 4Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it. 2RICHMOND. Great God of heaven, say Amen to al2! 4But, teL2 me is young George Stanley living. 2DERBY. He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town, 4Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us. 2RICHMOND. What men of name are slain on either side? 2DERBY. John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Fer2ers, 4Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir Wil2iam Brandon. 2RICHMOND. Inter their bodies as becomes their births. 6Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled 4That in submis2ion wil2 return to us. 4And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament, 4We wil2 unite the white rose and the red. 4Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction, 4That long have frown'd upon their emnity! 4What traitor hears me, and says not Amen? 4England hath long be2n mad, and scar2'd herself; 4The brother blindly shed the brother's blo2d, 4The father rashly slaughter'd his own son, 4The son, compel2'd, be2n butcher to the sire; 4Al2 this divided York and Lancaster, 4Divided in their dire division, 4O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth, 4The true suc2e2ders of each royal house, 4By God's fair ordinance conjoin together! 4And let their heirs, God, if thy wil2 be so, 4Enrich the time to come with smo2th-fac'd peace, 4With smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days! 4Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord, 6That would reduce these blo2dy days again 4And make po2r England we2p in streams of blo2d! 4Let them not live to taste this land's increase 4That would with treason wound this fair land's peace! 4Now civil wounds are stop2'd, peace lives again- 4That she may long live here, God say Amen! 12ExeuntTHE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21595THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIETby Wil2iam ShakespeareDramatis Personae 2Chorus. 2Escalus, Prince of Verona. 2Paris, a young Count, kinsman to the Prince. 2Montague, heads of two houses at variance with each other. 2Capulet, heads of two houses at variance with each other. 2An old Man, of the Capulet family. 2Romeo, son to Montague. 2Tybalt, nephew to Lady Capulet. 2Mercutio, kinsman to the Prince and friend to Romeo. 2Benvolio, nephew to Montague, and friend to Romeo 2Tybalt, nephew to Lady Capulet. 2Friar Laurence, Franciscan. 2Friar John, Franciscan. 2Balthasar, servant to Romeo. 2Abram, servant to Montague. 2Sampson, servant to Capulet. 2Gregory, servant to Capulet. 2Peter, servant to Juliet's nurse. 2An Apothecary. 4Thre2 Musicians. 2An Of2icer. 2Lady Montague, wife to Montague. 2Lady Capulet, wife to Capulet. 2Juliet, daughter to Capulet. 2Nurse to Juliet. 2Citizens of Verona; Gentlemen and Gentlewomen of both houses; 4Maskers, Torchbearers, Pages, Guards, Watchmen, Servants, and 4At2endants. 28SCENE.-2Verona; Mantua. 24THE PROLOGUE 24Enter Chorus. 2Chor.

Scene I.Verona. A public place.Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house of Capulet. 2Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'l2 not car2y coals. 2Greg. No, for then we should be col2iers. 2Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'l2 draw. 2Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of col2ar. 2Samp. I strike quickly, being moved. 2Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike. 2Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me. 2Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand. 4Therefore, if thou art moved, thou run2'st away. 2Samp. A dog of that house shal2 move me to stand. I wil2 take the 4wal2 of any man or maid of Montague's. 2Greg. That shows the2 a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the 4wal2. 2Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker ves2els, are 4ever thrust to the wal2. Therefore I wil2 push Montague's men 4from the wal2 and thrust his maids to the wal2. 2Greg. The quar2el is betwe2n our masters and us their men. 4Samp. 'Tis al2 one. I wil2 show myself a tyrant. When I have fought 4with the men, I wil2 be cruel with the maids- I wil2 cut of2 4their heads. 2Greg. The heads of the maids? 2Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads. 4Take it in what sense thou wilt. 2Greg. They must take it in sense that fe2l it. 2Samp. Me they shal2 fe2l while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I 4am a pret2y piece of flesh. 2Greg. 'Tis wel2 thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst be2n 4po2r-John. Draw thy to2l! Here comes two of the house of 4Montagues. 11Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar]. 2Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quar2el! I wil2 back the2. 2Greg. How? turn thy back and run? 2Samp. Fear me not. 2Greg. No, mar2y. I fear the2! 2Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. 4Greg. I wil2 frown as I pas2 by, and let them take it as they list. 2Samp. Nay, as they dare. I wil2 bite my thumb at them; which is 4disgrace to them, if they bear it. 2Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? 2Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir. 2Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? 2Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay? 2Greg. [aside to Sampson] No. 2Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my 4thumb, sir. 2Greg. Do you quar2el, sir? 2Abr. Quar2el, sir? No, sir. 2Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as go2d a man as you. 2Abr. No bet2er. 2Samp. Wel2, sir. 24Enter Benvolio. 2Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'bet2er.' Here comes one of my 4master's kinsmen. 4Samp. Yes, bet2er, sir. 2Abr. You lie. 2Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow. 53They fight. 2Ben. Part, fo2ls! [Beats down their swords.] 4Put up your swords. You know not what you do. 26Enter Tybalt. 2Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartles2 hinds? 4Turn the2 Benvolio! lo2k upon thy death. 2Ben. I do but ke2p the peace. Put up thy sword, 4Or manage it to part these men with me. 2Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word 4As I hate hel2, al2 Montagues, and the2. 4Have at the2, coward! 28They fight. 5Enter an of2icer, and thre2 or four Citizens with clubs or 26partisans. 4Of2icer. Clubs, bil2s, and partisans! Strike! beat them down! 2Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues! 11Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife. 2Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho! 2Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why cal2 you for a sword? 2Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come 4And flourishes his blade in spite of me. 17Enter Old Montague and his Wife. 2Mon. Thou vil2ain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go. 2M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one fo2t to se2k a foe. 16Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train. 2Prince. Rebel2ious subjects, enemies to peace, 4Profaners of this neighbour-stained ste2l- 4Wil2 they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts, 6That quench the fire of your pernicious rage 4With purple fountains is2uing from your veins! 4On pain of torture, from those blo2dy hands 4Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground 4And hear the sentence of your moved prince. 4Thre2 civil brawls, bred of an airy word 4By the2, old Capulet, and Montague, 4Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our stre2ts 4And made Verona's ancient citizens 4Cast by their grave bese2ming ornaments 4To wield old partisans, in hands as old, 4Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate. 4If ever you disturb our stre2ts again, 4Your lives shal2 pay the forfeit of the peace. 4For this time al2 the rest depart away. 4You, Capulet, shal2 go along with me; 4And, Montague, come you this afterno2n, 4To know our farther pleasure in this case, 4To old Fre2town, our com2on judgment place. 4Once more, on pain of death, al2 men depart. 16Exeunt [al2 but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio]. 2Mon. Who set this ancient quar2el new abroach? 4Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? 2Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary 4And yours, close fighting ere I did ap2roach. 4I drew to part them. In the instant came 4The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd; 4Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears, 4He swung about his head and cut the winds, 4Who, nothing hurt withal, his2'd him in scorn. 4While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, 4Came more and more, and fought on part and part, 4Til2 the Prince came, who parted either part. 2M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day? 4Right glad I am he was not at this fray. 2Ben. Madam, an hour before the worship2'd sun 4Pe2r'd forth the golden window of the East, 4A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; 4Where, underneath the grove of sycamore 4That westward ro2teth from the city's side, 6So early walking did I se2 your son. 4Towards him I made; but he was ware of me 4And stole into the covert of the wo2d. 4I- measuring his af2ections by my own, 4Which then most sought where most might not be found, 4Being one to2 many by my weary self- 4Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his, 4And gladly shun2'd who gladly fled from me. 2Mon. Many a morning hath he there be2n se2n, 4With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew, 4Ad2ing to clouds more clouds with his de2p sighs; 4But al2 so so2n as the al2-che2ring sun 4Should in the farthest East bean to draw 4The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, 4Away from light steals home my heavy son 4And private in his chamber pens himself, 4Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight 4And makes himself an artificial night. 4Black and portentous must this humour prove 4Unles2 go2d counsel may the cause remove. 4Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause? 2Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him 2Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means? 2Mon. Both by myself and many other friend; 4But he, his own af2ections' counsel2or, 4Is to himself- I wil2 not say how true- 4But to himself so secret and so close, 4So far from sounding and discovery, 4As is the bud bit with an envious worm 4Ere he can spread his swe2t leaves to the air 4Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. 4Could we but learn from whence his sor2ows grow, 4We would as wil2ingly give cure as know. 23Enter Romeo. 2Ben. Se2, where he comes. So please you step aside, 4I'l2 know his grievance, or be much denied. 2Mon. I would thou wert so hap2y by thy stay 4To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away, 39Exeunt [Montague and Wife]. 2Ben. Go2d mor2ow, cousin. 2Rom. Is the day so young? 2Ben. But new struck nine. 2Rom. Ay me! sad hours se2m long. 4Was that my father that went hence so fast? 2Ben. It was. What sadnes2 lengthens Romeo's hours? 2Rom. Not having that which having makes them short. 2Ben. In love? 2Rom. Out- 2Ben. Of love? 2Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love. 2Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view, 4Should be so tyran2ous and rough in pro2f! 2Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muf2led stil2, 4Should without eyes se2 pathways to his wil2! 4Where shal2 we dine? O me! What fray was here? 4Yet tel2 me not, for I have heard it al2. 4Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. 4Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate! 6O anything, of nothing first create! 4O heavy lightnes2! serious vanity! 4Mis2hapen chaos of wel2-se2ming forms! 4Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health! 4Stil2-waking sle2p, that is not what it is 4This love fe2l I, that fe2l no love in this. 4Dost thou not laugh? 2Ben. No, coz, I rather we2p. 2Rom. Go2d heart, at what? 2Ben. At thy go2d heart's op2res2ion. 2Rom. Why, such is love's transgres2ion. 4Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, 4Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest 4With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown 4Doth ad2 more grief to to2 much of mine own. 4Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs; 4Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes; 4Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears. 4What is it else? A madnes2 most discre2t, 4A choking gal2, and a preserving swe2t. 6Farewel2, my coz. 2Ben. Soft! I wil2 go along. 4An if you leave me so, you do me wrong. 2Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here: 4This is not Romeo, he's some other where. 2Ben. Tel2 me in sadnes2, who is that you love? 2Rom. What, shal2 I groan and tel2 the2? 2Ben. Groan? Why, no; 4But sadly tel2 me who. 2Rom. Bid a sick man in sadnes2 make his wil2. 4Ah, word il2 urg'd to one that is so il2! 4In sadnes2, cousin, I do love a woman. 2Ben. I aim'd so near when I sup2os'd you lov'd. 2Rom. A right go2d markman! And she's fair I love. 2Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is so2nest hit. 2Rom. Wel2, in that hit you mis2. She'l2 not be hit 4With Cupid's ar2ow. She hath Dian's wit, 4And, in strong pro2f of chastity wel2 arm'd, 4From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd. 4She wil2 not stay the siege of loving terms, 6Nor bide th' encounter of as2ailing eyes, 4Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold. 4O, she's rich in beauty; only po2r 4That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store. 2Ben. Then she hath sworn that she wil2 stil2 live chaste? 2Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste; 4For beauty, starv'd with her severity, 4Cuts beauty of2 from al2 posterity. 4She is to2 fair, to2 wise, wisely to2 fair, 4To merit blis2 by making me despair. 4She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow 4Do I live dead that live to tel2 it now. 2Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her. 2Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think! 2Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes. 4Examine other beauties. 2Rom. 'Tis the way 4To cal2 hers (exquisite) in question more. 4These hap2y masks that kis2 fair ladies' brows, 4Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair. 6He that is strucken blind can2ot forget 4The precious treasure of his eyesight lost. 4Show me a mistres2 that is pas2ing fair, 4What doth her beauty serve but as a note 4Where I may read who pas2'd that pas2ing fair? 4Farewel2. Thou canst not teach me to forget. 2Ben. I'l2 pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. 6Exeunt.Scene I2.A Stre2t.Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown. 2Cap. But Montague is bound as wel2 as I, 4In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think, 4For men so old as we to ke2p the peace. 2Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both, 4And pity 'tis you liv'd at od2s so long. 4But now, my lord, what say you to my suit? 2Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before: 4My child is yet a stranger in the world, 4She hath not se2n the change of fourte2n years; 4Let two more sum2ers wither in their pride 4Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. 2Par. Younger than she are hap2y mothers made. 2Cap. And to2 so2n mar2'd are those so early made. 4The earth hath swal2owed al2 my hopes but she; 4She is the hopeful lady of my earth. 4But wo2 her, gentle Paris, get her heart; 4My wil2 to her consent is but a part. 6An she agre2, within her scope of choice 4Lies my consent and fair ac2ording voice. 4This night I hold an old ac2ustom'd feast, 4Whereto I have invited many a guest, 4Such as I love; and you among the store, 4One more, most welcome, makes my number more. 4At my po2r house lo2k to behold this night 4Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light. 4Such comfort as do lusty young men fe2l 4When wel2 ap2arel2'd April on the he2l 4Of limping Winter treads, even such delight 4Among fresh female buds shal2 you this night 4Inherit at my house. Hear al2, al2 se2, 4And like her most whose merit most shal2 be; 4Which, on more view of many, mine, being one, 4May stand in number, though in reck'ning none. 4Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go, sir2ah, 6trudge about 4Through fair Verona; find those persons out 4Whose names are writ2en there, and to them say, 6My house and welcome on their pleasure stay- 37Exeunt [Capulet and Paris]. 2Serv. Find them out whose names are writ2en here? It is writ2en 4that the shoemaker should med2le with his yard and the tailor 4with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter with 4his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are 4here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath 4here writ. I must to the learned. In go2d time! 19Enter Benvolio and Romeo. 2Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning; 4One pain is les2oned by another's anguish; 4Turn gid2y, and be holp by backward turning; 4One desperate grief cures with another's languish. 4Take thou some new infection to thy eye, 4And the rank poison of the old wil2 die. 2Rom. Your plantain leaf is excel2ent for that. 2Ben. For what, I pray the2? 2Rom. For your broken shin. 4Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad? 2Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is; 4Shut up in Prison, kept without my fo2d, 4Whip2'd and tormented and- God-den, go2d fel2ow. 2Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read? 2Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. 2Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without bo2k. But I pray, can you 4read anything you se2? 2Rom. Ay, If I know the let2ers and the language. 2Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you mer2y! 2Rom. Stay, fel2ow; I can read. 23He reads. 6'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; 6County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters; 6The lady widow of Vitruvio; 6Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces; 6Mercutio and his brother Valentine; 6Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters; 6My fair niece Rosaline and Livia; 6Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt; 8Lucio and the lively Helena.' 4[Gives back the paper.] A fair as2embly. Whither should they come? 2Serv. Up. 2Rom. Whither? 2Serv. To sup2er, to our house. 2Rom. Whose house? 2Serv. My master's. 2Rom. Inde2d I should have ask'd you that before. 2Serv. Now I'l2 tel2 you without asking. My master is the great rich 4Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come 4and crush a cup of wine. Rest you mer2y! 15Exit. 2Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's 4Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st; 4With al2 the admired beauties of Verona. 4Go thither, and with unat2ainted eye 4Compare her face with some that I shal2 show, 4And I wil2 make the2 think thy swan a crow. 2Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye 4Maintains such falseho2d, then turn tears to fires; 6And these, who, often drown'd, could never die, 4Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars! 4One fairer than my love? The al2-se2ing sun 4Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun. 2Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by, 4Herself pois'd with herself in either eye; 4But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd 4Your lady's love against some other maid 4That I wil2 show you shining at this feast, 4And she shal2 scant show wel2 that now se2ms best. 2Rom. I'l2 go along, no such sight to be shown, 4But to rejoice in splendour of my own. 14[Exeunt.]Scene I3.Capulet's house.Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse. 2Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Cal2 her forth to me. 2Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old, 4I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird! 4God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet! 25Enter Juliet. 2Jul. How now? Who cal2s? 2Nurse. Your mother. 2Jul. Madam, I am here. 4What is your wil2? 2Wife. This is the mat2er- Nurse, give leave awhile, 4We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; 4I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel. 4Thou knowest my daughter's of a pret2y age. 2Nurse. Faith, I can tel2 her age unto an hour. 2Wife. She's not fourte2n. 4Nurse. I'l2 lay fourte2n of my te2th- 4And yet, to my te2n be it spoken, I have but four- 4She is not fourte2n. How long is it now 4To Lam2astide? 2Wife. A fortnight and od2 days. 2Nurse. Even or od2, of al2 days in the year, 4Come Lam2as Eve at night shal2 she be fourte2n. 4Susan and she (God rest al2 Christian souls!) 4Were of an age. Wel2, Susan is with God; 4She was to2 go2d for me. But, as I said, 4On Lam2as Eve at night shal2 she be fourte2n; 4That shal2 she, mar2y; I remember it wel2. 4'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; 4And she was wean'd (I never shal2 forget it), 4Of al2 the days of the year, upon that day; 4For I had then laid wormwo2d to my dug, 4Sit2ing in the sun under the dovehouse wal2. 4My lord and you were then at Mantua. 4Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said, 4When it did taste the wormwo2d on the nip2le 6Of my dug and felt it bit2er, pret2y fo2l, 4To se2 it tetchy and fal2 out with the dug! 4Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no ne2d, I trow, 4To bid me trudge. 4And since that time it is eleven years, 4For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' ro2d, 4She could have run and wad2led al2 about; 4For even the day before, she broke her brow; 4And then my husband (God be with his soul! 4'A was a mer2y man) to2k up the child. 4'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fal2 upon thy face? 4Thou wilt fal2 backward when thou hast more wit; 4Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam, 4The pret2y wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.' 4To se2 now how a jest shal2 come about! 4I war2ant, an I should live a thousand yeas, 4I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he, 4And, pret2y fo2l, it stinted, and said 'Ay.' 2Wife. Enough of this. I pray the2 hold thy peace. 2Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I can2ot cho2se but laugh 6To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.' 4And yet, I war2ant, it bad upon it brow 4A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone; 4A perilous knock; and it cried bit2erly. 4'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fal2'st upon thy face? 4Thou wilt fal2 backward when thou comest to age; 4Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.' 2Jul. And stint thou to2, I pray the2, nurse, say I. 2Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark the2 to his grace! 4Thou wast the pret2iest babe that e'er I nurs'd. 4An I might live to se2 the2 mar2ied once, I have my wish. 2Wife. Mar2y, that 'mar2y' is the very theme 4I came to talk of. Tel2 me, daughter Juliet, 4How stands your disposition to be mar2ied? 2Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of. 2Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse, 4I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat. 2Wife. Wel2, think of mar2iage now. Younger than you, 4Here in Verona, ladies of este2m, 4Are made already mothers. By my count, 6I was your mother much upon these years 4That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief: 4The valiant Paris se2ks you for his love. 2Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man 4As al2 the world- why he's a man of wax. 2Wife. Verona's sum2er hath not such a flower. 2Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower. 2Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman? 4This night you shal2 behold him at our feast. 4Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, 4And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; 4Examine every mar2ied lineament, 4And se2 how one another lends content; 4And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies 4Find writ2en in the margent of his eyes, 4This precious bo2k of love, this unbound lover, 4To beautify him only lacks a cover. 4The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride 4For fair without the fair within to hide. 4That bo2k in many's eyes doth share the glory, 6That in gold clasps locks in the golden story; 4So shal2 you share al2 that he doth pos2es2, 4By having him making yourself no les2. 2Nurse. No les2? Nay, big2er! Women grow by men 2Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love? 2Jul. I'l2 lo2k to like, if lo2king liking move; 4But no more de2p wil2 I endart mine eye 4Than your consent gives strength to make it fly. 24Enter Servingman. 2Serv. Madam, the guests are come, sup2er serv'd up, you cal2'd, my 4young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and 4everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I bese2ch you 4fol2ow straight. 2Wife. We fol2ow the2. 23Exit [Servingman]. 4Juliet, the County stays. 2Nurse. Go, girl, se2k hap2y nights to hap2y days. 57Exeunt.Scene IV.A stre2t.Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers; Torchbearers. 2Rom. What, shal2 this spe2ch be spoke for our excuse? 4Or shal2 we on without apology? 2Ben. The date is out of such prolixity. 4We'l2 have no Cupid ho2dwink'd with a scarf, 4Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath, 4Scaring the ladies like a crowke2per; 4Nor no without-bo2k prologue, faintly spoke 4After the prompter, for our entrance; 4But, let them measure us by what they wil2, 4We'l2 measure them a measure, and be gone. 2Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling. 4Being but heavy, I wil2 bear the light. 2Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. 2Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes 4With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead 4So stakes me to the ground I can2ot move. 4Mer. You are a lover. Bor2ow Cupid's wings 4And soar with them above a com2on bound. 2Rom. I am to2 sore enpierced with his shaft 4To soar with his light feathers; and so bound 4I can2ot bound a pitch above dul2 woe. 4Under love's heavy burthen do I sink. 2Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love- 4To2 great op2res2ion for a tender thing. 2Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is to2 rough, 4To2 rude, to2 boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn. 2Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love. 4Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. 4Give me a case to put my visage in. 4A visor for a visor! What care I 4What curious eye doth quote deformities? 4Here are the be2tle brows shal2 blush for me. 2Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no so2ner in 4But every man betake him to his legs. 2Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart 4Tickle the senseles2 rushes with their he2ls; 6For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase, 4I'l2 be a candle-holder and lo2k on; 4The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done. 2Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word! 4If thou art Dun, we'l2 draw the2 from the mire 4Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st 4Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho! 2Rom. Nay, that's not so. 2Mer. I mean, sir, in delay 4We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day. 4Take our go2d meaning, for our judgment sits 4Five times in that ere once in our five wits. 2Rom. And we mean wel2, in going to this masque; 4But 'tis no wit to go. 2Mer. Why, may one ask? 2Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night. 2Mer. And so did I. 2Rom. Wel2, what was yours? 2Mer. That dreamers often lie. 2Rom. In bed asle2p, while they do dream things true. 4Mer. O, then I se2 Que2n Mab hath be2n with you. 4She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes 4In shape no big2er than an agate stone 4On the forefinger of an alderman, 4Drawn with a team of lit2le atomies 4Athwart men's noses as they lie asle2p; 4Her wagon spokes made of long spin2ers' legs, 4The cover, of the wings of gras2hop2ers; 4Her traces, of the smal2est spider's web; 4Her col2ars, of the mo2nshine's wat'ry beams; 4Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film; 4Her wagoner, a smal2 grey-coated gnat, 4Not half so big as a round lit2le worm 4Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid; 4Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, 4Made by the joiner squir2el or old grub, 4Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers. 4And in this state she 'gal2ops night by night 4Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; 4O'er courtiers' kne2s, that dream on cursies straight; 6O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fe2s; 4O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kis2es dream, 4Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, 4Because their breaths with swe2tmeats tainted are. 4Sometime she gal2ops o'er a courtier's nose, 4And then dreams he of smel2ing out a suit; 4And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail 4Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asle2p, 4Then dreams he of another benefice. 4Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, 4And then dreams he of cut2ing foreign throats, 4Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, 4Of healths five fadom de2p; and then anon 4Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, 4And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two 4And sle2ps again. This is that very Mab 4That plats the manes of horses in the night 4And bakes the elflocks in foul slut2ish, hairs, 4Which once untangled much misfortune bodes 4This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, 6That pres2es them and learns them first to bear, 4Making them women of go2d car2iage. 4This is she- 2Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace! 4Thou talk'st of nothing. 2Mer. True, I talk of dreams; 4Which are the children of an idle brain, 4Begot of nothing but vain fantasy; 4Which is as thin of substance as the air, 4And more inconstant than the wind, who wo2es 4Even now the frozen bosom of the North 4And, being anger'd, puf2s away from thence, 4Turning his face to the dew-drop2ing South. 2Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves. 4Sup2er is done, and we shal2 come to2 late. 2Rom. I fear, to2 early; for my mind misgives 4Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars, 4Shal2 bit2erly begin his fearful date 4With this night's revels and expire the term 4Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast, 6By some vile forfeit of untimely death. 4But he that hath the ste2rage of my course 4Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen! 2Ben. Strike, drum. 27They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]Scene V.Capulet's house.Servingmen come forth with napkins. 21. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? 4He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher! 22. Serv. When go2d man2ers shal2 lie al2 in one or two men's hands, 4and they unwash'd to2, 'tis a foul thing. 21. Serv. Away with the join-sto2ls, remove the court-cub2ert, lo2k 4to the plate. Go2d thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as 4thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nel2. 4Anthony, and Potpan! 22. Serv. Ay, boy, ready. 21. Serv. You are lo2k'd for and cal2'd for, ask'd for and sought 4for, in the great chamber. 23. Serv. We can2ot be here and there to2. Che2rly, boys! 4Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take al2. 6Exeunt. 4Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife, 14Juliet, Tybalt, and al2 the Guests 15and Gentlewomen to the Maskers. 4Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes 4Unplagu'd with corns wil2 have a bout with you. 4Ah ha, my mistres2es! which of you al2 4Wil2 now deny to dance? She that makes dainty, 4She I'l2 swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now? 4Welcome, gentlemen! I have se2n the day 4That I have worn a visor and could tel2 4A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear, 4Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone! 4You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play. 4A hal2, a hal2! give ro2m! and fo2t it, girls. 36Music plays, and they dance. 4More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up, 4And quench the fire, the ro2m is grown to2 hot. 4Ah, sir2ah, this unlo2k'd-for sport comes wel2. 4Nay, sit, nay, sit, go2d cousin Capulet, 4For you and I are past our dancing days. 4How long is't now since last yourself and I 4Were in a mask? 42. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years. 2Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much! 4'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, 4Come Pentecost as quickly as it wil2, 4Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd. 22. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir; 4His son is thirty. 2Cap. Wil2 you tel2 me that? 4His son was but a ward two years ago. 2Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the hand 4Of yonder knight? 2Serv. I know not, sir. 2Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! 4It se2ms she hangs upon the che2k of night 4Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear- 4Beauty to2 rich for use, for earth to2 dear! 4So shows a snowy dove tro2ping with crows 4As yonder lady o'er her fel2ows shows. 4The measure done, I'l2 watch her place of stand 4And, touching hers, make bles2ed my rude hand. 6Did my heart love til2 now? Forswear it, sight! 4For I ne'er saw true beauty til2 this night. 2Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague. 4Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave 4Come hither, cover'd with an antic face, 4To fle2r and scorn at our solemnity? 4Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, 4To strike him dead I hold it not a sin. 2Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so? 2Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe; 4A vil2ain, that is hither come in spite 4To scorn at our solemnity this night. 2Cap. Young Romeo is it? 2Tyb. 'Tis he, that vil2ain Romeo. 2Cap. Content the2, gentle coz, let him alone. 4'A bears him like a portly gentleman, 4And, to say truth, Verona brags of him 4To be a virtuous and wel2-govern'd youth. 4I would not for the wealth of al2 this town 4Here in my house do him disparagement. 6Therefore be patient, take no note of him. 4It is my wil2; the which if thou respect, 4Show a fair presence and put of2 these frowns, 4An il2-bese2ming semblance for a feast. 2Tyb. It fits when such a vil2ain is a guest. 4I'l2 not endure him. 2Cap. He shal2 be endur'd. 4What, go2dman boy? I say he shal2. Go to! 4Am I the master here, or you? Go to! 4You'l2 not endure him? God shal2 mend my soul! 4You'l2 make a mutiny among my guests! 4You wil2 set cock-a-ho2p! you'l2 be the man! 2Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame. 2Cap. Go to, go to! 4You are a saucy boy. Is't so, inde2d? 4This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what. 4You must contrary me! Mar2y, 'tis time.- 4Wel2 said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go! 4Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame! 4I'l2 make you quiet; what!- Che2rly, my hearts! 4Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler me2ting 4Makes my flesh tremble in their dif2erent gre2ting. 4I wil2 withdraw; but this intrusion shal2, 4Now se2ming swe2t, convert to bit2'rest gal2. 10Exit. 2Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand 4This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: 4My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand 4To smo2th that rough touch with a tender kis2. 2Jul. Go2d pilgrim, you do wrong your hand to2 much, 4Which man2erly devotion shows in this; 4For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, 4And palm to palm is holy palmers' kis2. 2Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers to2? 2Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r. 2Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do! 4They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. 2Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. 2Rom. Then move not while my prayer's ef2ect I take. 4Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd. 2[Kis2es her.] 2Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have to2k. 4Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespas2 swe2tly urg'd! 4Give me my sin again. 26[Kis2es her.] 2Jul. You kis2 by th' bo2k. 2Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you. 2Rom. What is her mother? 2Nurse. Mar2y, bachelor, 4Her mother is the lady of the house. 4And a go2d lady, and a wise and virtuous. 4I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal. 4I tel2 you, he that can lay hold of her 4Shal2 have the chinks. 2Rom. Is she a Capulet? 4O dear ac2ount! my life is my foe's debt. 2Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best. 2Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest. 2Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone; 4We have a trifling fo2lish banquet towards. 4Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you al2. 4I thank you, honest gentlemen. Go2d night. 4More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed. 6Ah, sir2ah, by my fay, it waxes late; 4I'l2 to my rest. 30Exeunt [al2 but Juliet and Nurse]. 2Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman? 2Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio. 2Jul. What's he that now is going out of do2r? 2Nurse. Mar2y, that, I think, be young Petruchio. 2Jul. What's he that fol2ows there, that would not dance? 2Nurse. I know not. 2Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be mar2ied, 4My grave is like to be my wed2ing bed. 2Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague, 4The only son of your great enemy. 2Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate! 4To2 early se2n unknown, and known to2 late! 4Prodigious birth of love it is to me 4That I must love a loathed enemy. 2Nurse. What's this? what's this? 2Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now 4Of one I danc'd withal. 39One cal2s within, 'Juliet.' 2Nurse. Anon, anon! 4Come, let's away; the strangers al2 are gone. 8Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2PROLOGUE2nter Chorus. 2Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie, 4And young af2ection gapes to be his heir; 4That fair for which love groan'd for and would die, 4With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair. 4Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again, 4Alike bewitched by the charm of lo2ks; 4But to his foe sup2os'd he must complain, 4And she steal love's swe2t bait from fearful ho2ks. 4Being held a foe, he may not have ac2es2 4To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear, 4And she as much in love, her means much les2 4To me2t her new beloved anywhere; 4But pas2ion lends them power, time means, to me2t, 4Temp'ring extremities with extreme swe2t.Exit.ACT I2. Scene I.A lane by the wal2 of Capulet's orchard.Enter Romeo alone. 2Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here? 4Turn back, dul2 earth, and find thy centre out. 21[Climbs the wal2 and leaps down within it.] 19Enter Benvolio with Mercutio. 2Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo! 2Mer. He is wise, 4And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed. 2Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wal2. 4Cal2, go2d Mercutio. 2Mer. Nay, I'l2 conjure to2. 4Romeo! humours! madman! pas2ion! lover! 4Ap2ear thou in the likenes2 of a sigh; 4Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied! 4Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove'; 4Speak to my gos2ip Venus one fair word, 6One nickname for her purblind son and heir, 4Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim 4When King Cophetua lov'd the beg2ar maid! 4He heareth not, he stir2eth not, be moveth not; 4The ape is dead, and I must conjure him. 4I conjure the2 by Rosaline's bright eyes. 4By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, 4By her fine fo2t, straight leg, and quivering thigh, 4And the demesnes that there adjacent lie, 4That in thy likenes2 thou ap2ear to us! 2Ben. An if he hear the2, thou wilt anger him. 2Mer. This can2ot anger him. 'Twould anger him 4To raise a spirit in his mistres2' circle 4Of some strange nature, let2ing it there stand 4Til2 she had laid it and conjur'd it down. 4That were some spite; my invocation 4Is fair and honest: in his mistres2' name, 4I conjure only but to raise up him. 2Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these tre2s 4To be consorted with the humorous night. 6Blind is his love and best befits the dark. 2Mer. If love be blind, love can2ot hit the mark. 4Now wil2 he sit under a medlar tre2 4And wish his mistres2 were that kind of fruit 4As maids cal2 medlars when they laugh alone. 4O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were 4An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear! 4Romeo, go2d night. I'l2 to my truckle-bed; 4This field-bed is to2 cold for me to sle2p. 4Come, shal2 we go? 2Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain 4'To se2k him here that means not to be found. 57Exeunt.Scene I2.Capulet's orchard.Enter Romeo. 2Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound. 21Enter Juliet above at a window. 4But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? 4It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! 4Arise, fair sun, and kil2 the envious mo2n, 4Who is already sick and pale with grief 4That thou her maid art far more fair than she. 4Be not her maid, since she is envious. 4Her vestal livery is but sick and gre2n, 4And none but fo2ls do wear it. Cast it of2. 4It is my lady; O, it is my love! 4O that she knew she were! 4She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that? 4Her eye discourses; I wil2 answer it. 4I am to2 bold; 'tis not to me she speaks. 6Two of the fairest stars in al2 the heaven, 4Having some busines2, do entreat her eyes 4To twinkle in their spheres til2 they return. 4What if her eyes were there, they in her head? 4The brightnes2 of her che2k would shame those stars 4As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven 4Would through the airy region stream so bright 4That birds would sing and think it were not night. 4Se2 how she leans her che2k upon her hand! 4O that I were a glove upon that hand, 4That I might touch that che2k! 2Jul. Ay me! 2Rom. She speaks. 4O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art 4As glorious to this night, being o'er my head, 4As is a winged mes2enger of heaven 4Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes 4Of mortals that fal2 back to gaze on him 4When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds 4And sails upon the bosom of the air. 4Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? 4Deny thy father and refuse thy name! 4Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 4And I'l2 no longer be a Capulet. 2Rom. [aside] Shal2 I hear more, or shal2 I speak at this? 2Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. 4Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. 4What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor fo2t, 4Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part 4Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! 4What's in a name? That which we cal2 a rose 4By any other name would smel2 as swe2t. 4So Romeo would, were he not Romeo cal2'd, 4Retain that dear perfection which he owes 4Without that title. Romeo, dof2 thy name; 4And for that name, which is no part of the2, 4Take al2 myself. 2Rom. I take the2 at thy word. 4Cal2 me but love, and I'l2 be new baptiz'd; 4Henceforth I never wil2 be Romeo. 4Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescre2n'd in night, 4So stumblest on my counsel? 2Rom. By a name 4I know not how to tel2 the2 who I am. 4My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, 4Because it is an enemy to the2. 4Had I it writ2en, I would tear the word. 2Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words 4Of that tongue's ut2erance, yet I know the sound. 4Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague? 2Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either the2 dislike. 2Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tel2 me, and wherefore? 4The orchard wal2s are high and hard to climb, 4And the place death, considering who thou art, 4If any of my kinsmen find the2 here. 2Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these wal2s; 4For stony limits can2ot hold love out, 4And what love can do, that dares love at2empt. 4Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me. 2Jul. If they do se2 the2, they wil2 murther the2. 4Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye 4Than twenty of their swords! Lo2k thou but swe2t, 4And I am pro2f against their enmity. 2Jul. I would not for the world they saw the2 here. 2Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight; 4And but thou love me, let them find me here. 4My life were bet2er ended by their hate 4Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. 2Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place? 2Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire. 4He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes. 4I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far 4As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea, 4I would adventure for such merchandise. 2Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face; 4Else would a maiden blush bepaint my che2k 4For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night. 4Fain would I dwel2 on form- fain, fain deny 4What I have spoke; but farewel2 compliment! 4Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay'; 6And I wil2 take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st, 4Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries, 4They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, 4If thou dost love, pronounce it faithful2y. 4Or if thou thinkest I am to2 quickly won, 4I'l2 frown, and be perverse, and say the2 nay, 4So thou wilt wo2; but else, not for the world. 4In truth, fair Montague, I am to2 fond, 4And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light; 4But trust me, gentleman, I'l2 prove more true 4Than those that have more cun2ing to be strange. 4I should have be2n more strange, I must confes2, 4But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware, 4My true-love pas2ion. Therefore pardon me, 4And not impute this yielding to light love, 4Which the dark night hath so discovered. 2Rom. Lady, by yonder bles2ed mo2n I swear, 4That tips with silver al2 these fruit-tre2 tops- 2Jul. O, swear not by the mo2n, th' inconstant mo2n, 4That monthly changes in her circled orb, 6Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. 2Rom. What shal2 I swear by? 2Jul. Do not swear at al2; 4Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, 4Which is the god of my idolatry, 4And I'l2 believe the2. 2Rom. If my heart's dear love- 2Jul. Wel2, do not swear. Although I joy in the2, 4I have no joy of this contract to-night. 4It is to2 rash, to2 unadvis'd, to2 sud2en; 4To2 like the lightning, which doth cease to be 4Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Swe2t, go2d night! 4This bud of love, by sum2er's ripening breath, 4May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we me2t. 4Go2d night, go2d night! As swe2t repose and rest 4Come to thy heart as that within my breast! 2Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? 2Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night? 2Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine. 2Jul. I gave the2 mine before thou didst request it; 6And yet I would it were to give again. 2Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love? 2Jul. But to be frank and give it the2 again. 4And yet I wish but for the thing I have. 4My bounty is as boundles2 as the sea, 4My love as de2p; the more I give to the2, 4The more I have, for both are infinite. 4I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu! 43[Nurse] cal2s within. 4Anon, go2d nurse! Swe2t Montague, be true. 4Stay but a lit2le, I wil2 come again. 16[Exit.] 2Rom. O bles2ed, bles2ed night! I am afeard, 4Being in night, al2 this is but a dream, 4To2 flat2ering-swe2t to be substantial. 23Enter Juliet above. 2Jul. Thre2 words, dear Romeo, and go2d night inde2d. 4If that thy bent of love be honourable, 4Thy purpose mar2iage, send me word to-mor2ow, 6By one that I'l2 procure to come to the2, 4Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; 4And al2 my fortunes at thy fo2t I'l2 lay 4And fol2ow the2 my lord throughout the world. 2Nurse. (within) Madam! 2Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not wel2, 4I do bese2ch the2- 2Nurse. (within) Madam! 2Jul. By-and-by I come.- 4To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief. 4To-mor2ow wil2 I send. 2Rom. So thrive my soul- 2Jul. A thousand times go2d night! 24Exit. 2Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light! 4Love goes toward love as scho2lboys from their bo2ks; 4But love from love, towards scho2l with heavy lo2ks. 21Enter Juliet again, [above]. 2Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice 6To lure this tas2el-gentle back again! 4Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud; 4Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, 4And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine 4With repetition of my Romeo's name. 4Romeo! 2Rom. It is my soul that cal2s upon my name. 4How silver-swe2t sound lovers' tongues by night, 4Like softest music to at2ending ears! 2Jul. Romeo! 2Rom. My dear? 2Jul. At what o'clock to-mor2ow 4Shal2 I send to the2? 2Rom. By the hour of nine. 2Jul. I wil2 not fail. 'Tis twenty years til2 then. 4I have forgot why I did cal2 the2 back. 2Rom. Let me stand here til2 thou remember it. 2Jul. I shal2 forget, to have the2 stil2 stand there, 4Rememb'ring how I love thy company. 2Rom. And I'l2 stil2 stay, to have the2 stil2 forget, 6Forget2ing any other home but this. 2Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have the2 gone- 4And yet no farther than a wanton's bird, 4That lets it hop a lit2le from her hand, 4Like a po2r prisoner in his twisted gyves, 4And with a silk thread plucks it back again, 4So loving-jealous of his liberty. 2Rom. I would I were thy bird. 2Jul. Swe2t, so would I. 4Yet I should kil2 the2 with much cherishing. 4Go2d night, go2d night! Parting is such swe2t sor2ow, 4That I shal2 say go2d night til2 it be mor2ow. 57[Exit.] 2Rom. Sle2p dwel2 upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast! 4Would I were sle2p and peace, so swe2t to rest! 4Hence wil2 I to my ghostly father's cel2, 4His help to crave and my dear hap to tel2. ExitScene I3.Friar Laurence's cel2.Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket. 2Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night, 4Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light; 4And flecked darknes2 like a drunkard re2ls 4From forth day's path and Titan's fiery whe2ls. 4Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye 4The day to che2r and night's dank dew to dry, 4I must up-fil2 this osier cage of ours 4With baleful we2ds and precious-juiced flowers. 4The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb. 4What is her burying gave, that is her womb; 4And from her womb children of divers kind 4We sucking on her natural bosom find; 4Many for many virtues excel2ent, 4None but for some, and yet al2 dif2erent. 4O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies 4In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities; 4For naught so vile that on the earth doth live 6But to the earth some special go2d doth give; 4Nor aught so go2d but, strain'd from that fair use, 4Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse. 4Virtue itself turns vice, being misap2lied, 4And vice sometime's by action dignified. 4Within the infant rind of this smal2 flower 4Poison hath residence, and medicine power; 4For this, being smelt, with that part che2rs each part; 4Being tasted, slays al2 senses with the heart. 4Two such op2osed kings encamp them stil2 4In man as wel2 as herbs- grace and rude wil2; 4And where the worser is predominant, 4Ful2 so2n the canker death eats up that plant. 24Enter Romeo. 2Rom. Go2d mor2ow, father. 2Friar. Benedicite! 4What early tongue so swe2t saluteth me? 4Young son, it argues a distempered head 6So so2n to bid go2d mor2ow to thy bed. 4Care ke2ps his watch in every old man's eye, 4And where care lodges sle2p wil2 never lie; 4But where unbruised youth with unstuf2'd brain 4Doth couch his limbs, there golden sle2p doth reign. 4Therefore thy earlines2 doth me as2ure 4Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature; 4Or if not so, then here I hit it right- 4Our Romeo hath not be2n in bed to-night. 2Rom. That last is true-the swe2ter rest was mine. 2Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline? 2Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No. 4I have forgot that name, and that name's woe. 2Friar. That's my go2d son! But where hast thou be2n then? 2Rom. I'l2 tel2 the2 ere thou ask it me again. 4I have be2n feasting with mine enemy, 4Where on a sud2en one hath wounded me 4That's by me wounded. Both our remedies 4Within thy help and holy physic lies. 4I bear no hatred, bles2ed man, for, lo, 6My interces2ion likewise steads my foe. 2Friar. Be plain, go2d son, and homely in thy drift 4Rid2ling confes2ion finds but rid2ling shrift. 2Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set 4On the fair daughter of rich Capulet; 4As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine, 4And al2 combin'd, save what thou must combine 4By holy mar2iage. When, and where, and how 4We met, we wo2'd, and made exchange of vow, 4I'l2 tel2 the2 as we pas2; but this I pray, 4That thou consent to mar2y us to-day. 2Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here! 4Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, 4So so2n forsaken? Young men's love then lies 4Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. 4Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine 4Hath wash'd thy sal2ow che2ks for Rosaline! 4How much salt water thrown away in waste, 4To season love, that of it doth not taste! 4The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, 6Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears. 4Lo, here upon thy che2k the stain doth sit 4Of an old tear that is not wash'd of2 yet. 4If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine, 4Thou and these woes were al2 for Rosaline. 4And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then: 4Women may fal2 when there's no strength in men. 2Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline. 2Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine. 2Rom. And bad'st me bury love. 2Friar. Not in a grave 4To lay one in, another out to have. 2Rom. I pray the2 chide not. She whom I love now 4Doth grace for grace and love for love al2ow. 4The other did not so. 2Friar. O, she knew wel2 4Thy love did read by rote, that could not spel2. 4But come, young waverer, come go with me. 4In one respect I'l2 thy as2istant be; 4For this al2iance may so hap2y prove 6To turn your households' rancour to pure love. 2Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sud2en haste. 2Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast. 57Exeunt.Scene IV.A stre2t.Enter Benvolio and Mercutio. 2Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be? 4Came he not home to-night? 2Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man. 2Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, 4Torments him so that he wil2 sure run mad. 2Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, 4Hath sent a let2er to his father's house. 2Mer. A chal2enge, on my life. 2Ben. Romeo wil2 answer it. 2Mer. Any man that can write may answer a let2er. 2Ben. Nay, he wil2 answer the let2er's master, how he dares, being 4dared. 2Mer. Alas, po2r Romeo, he is already dead! stab2'd with a white 4wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the 4very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's but2-shaft; 4and is he a man to encounter Tybalt? 2Ben. Why, what is Tybalt? 4Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tel2 you. O, he's the 4courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing 4pricksong-ke2ps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his 4minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very 4butcher of a silk but2on, a duel2ist, a duel2ist! a gentleman of 4the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the 4im2ortal pas2ado! the punto reverse! the hay. 2Ben. The what? 2Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, af2ecting fantasticoes- these 4new tuners of ac2ent! 'By Jesu, a very go2d blade! a very tal2 4man! a very go2d whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing, 4grandsir, that we should be thus af2licted with these strange 4flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand so 4much on the new form that they can2ot sit at ease on the old 4bench? O, their bones, their bones! 31Enter Romeo. 2Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo! 2Mer. Without his roe, like a dried her2ing. O flesh, flesh, how art 6thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed 4in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (mar2y, she had a 4bet2er love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy, 4Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so, 4but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French 4salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit 4fairly last night. 2Rom. Go2d mor2ow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you? 2Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive? 2Rom. Pardon, go2d Mercutio. My busines2 was great, and in such a 4case as mine a man may strain courtesy. 2Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a 4man to bow in the hams. 2Rom. Meaning, to cursy. 2Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it. 2Rom. A most courteous exposition. 2Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy. 2Rom. Pink for flower. 2Mer. Right. 2Rom. Why, then is my pump wel2-flower'd. 4Mer. Wel2 said! Fol2ow me this jest now til2 thou hast worn out thy 4pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may 4remain, after the wearing, solely singular. 2Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singlenes2! 2Mer. Come betwe2n us, go2d Benvolio! My wits faint. 2Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'l2 cry a match. 2Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-go2se chase, I am done; for thou 4hast more of the wild go2se in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I 4have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the go2se? 2Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there 4for the go2se. 2Mer. I wil2 bite the2 by the ear for that jest. 2Rom. Nay, go2d go2se, bite not! 2Mer. Thy wit is a very bit2er swe2ting; it is a most sharp sauce. 2Rom. And is it not, then, wel2 serv'd in to a swe2t go2se? 2Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch 4nar2ow to an el2 broad! 2Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, ad2ed to the 4go2se, proves the2 far and wide a broad go2se. 2Mer. Why, is not this bet2er now than groaning for love? Now art 6thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by 4art as wel2 as by nature. For this drivel2ing love is like a 4great natural that runs lol2ing up and down to hide his bauble in 4a hole. 2Ben. Stop there, stop there! 2Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair. 2Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large. 2Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I was 4come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant inde2d to oc2upy 4the argument no longer. 2Rom. Here's go2dly gear! 22Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter]. 2Mer. A sail, a sail! 2Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock. 2Nurse. Peter! 2Peter. Anon. 2Nurse. My fan, Peter. 2Mer. Go2d Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of 6the two. 2Nurse. God ye go2d mor2ow, gentlemen. 2Mer. God ye go2d-den, fair gentlewoman. 2Nurse. Is it go2d-den? 2Mer. 'Tis no les2, I tel2 ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now 4upon the prick of no2n. 2Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you! 2Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar. 2Nurse. By my troth, it is wel2 said. 'For himself to mar,' quoth 4'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tel2 me where I may find the young 4Romeo? 2Rom. I can tel2 you; but young Romeo wil2 be older when you have 4found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of 4that name, for fault of a worse. 2Nurse. You say wel2. 2Mer. Yea, is the worst wel2? Very wel2 to2k, i' faith! wisely, 4wisely. 2Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you. 2Ben. She wil2 endite him to some sup2er. 2Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho! 4Rom. What hast thou found? 2Mer. No hare, sir; unles2 a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is 4something stale and hoar ere it be spent 37He walks by them and sings. 19An old hare hoar, 19And an old hare hoar, 16Is very go2d meat in Lent; 19But a hare that is hoar 19Is to2 much for a score 16When it hoars ere it be spent. 4Romeo, wil2 you come to your father's? We'l2 to din2er thither. 2Rom. I wil2 fol2ow you. 2Mer. Farewel2, ancient lady. Farewel2, 4[sings] lady, lady, lady. 38Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio. 2Nurse. Mar2y, farewel2! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant was 4this that was so ful2 of his ropery? 2Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and wil2 6speak more in a minute than he wil2 stand to in a month. 2Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'l2 take him down, an 'a 4were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I can2ot, 4I'l2 find those that shal2. Scurvy knave! I am none of his 4flirt-gil2s; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand 4by to2, and suf2er every knave to use me at his pleasure! 2Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my weapon 4should quickly have be2n out, I war2ant you. I dare draw as so2n 4as another man, if I se2 oc2asion in a go2d quar2el, and the law 4on my side. 2Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me 4quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you, 4my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I wil2 4ke2p to myself; but first let me tel2 ye, if ye should lead her 4into a fo2l's paradise, as they say, it were a very gros2 kind of 4behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and 4therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an 4il2 thing to be of2'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing. 2Rom. Nurse, com2end me to thy lady and mistres2. I protest unto 4the2- 4Nurse. Go2d heart, and I faith I wil2 tel2 her as much. Lord, 4Lord! she wil2 be a joyful woman. 2Rom. What wilt thou tel2 her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me. 2Nurse. I wil2 tel2 her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take 4it, is a gentlemanlike of2er. 2Rom. Bid her devise 4Some means to come to shrift this afterno2n; 4And there she shal2 at Friar Laurence' cel2 4Be shriv'd and mar2ied. Here is for thy pains. 2Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a pen2y. 2Rom. Go to! I say you shal2. 2Nurse. This afterno2n, sir? Wel2, she shal2 be there. 2Rom. And stay, go2d nurse, behind the ab2ey wal2. 4Within this hour my man shal2 be with the2 4And bring the2 cords made like a tackled stair, 4Which to the high topgal2ant of my joy 4Must be my convoy in the secret night. 4Farewel2. Be trusty, and I'l2 quit thy pains. 4Farewel2. Com2end me to thy mistres2. 2Nurse. Now God in heaven bles2 the2! Hark you, sir. 4Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse? 2Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say, 4Two may ke2p counsel, put2ing one away? 2Rom. I war2ant the2 my man's as true as ste2l. 2Nurse. Wel2, sir, my mistres2 is the swe2test lady. Lord, Lord! 4when 'twas a lit2le prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in 4town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, go2d 4soul, had as lieve se2 a toad, a very toad, as se2 him. I anger 4her sometimes, and tel2 her that Paris is the properer man; but 4I'l2 war2ant you, when I say so, she lo2ks as pale as any clout 4in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with 4a let2er? 2Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R. 2Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I know 4it begins with some other let2er; and she hath the pret2iest 4sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you go2d 4to hear it. 2Rom. Com2end me to thy lady. 2Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter! 2Peter. Anon. 4Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace. 57Exeunt.Scene V.Capulet's orchard.Enter Juliet. 2Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse; 4In half an hour she 'promis'd to return. 4Perchance she can2ot me2t him. That's not so. 4O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts, 4Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams 4Driving back shadows over low'ring hil2s. 4Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love, 4And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings. 4Now is the sun upon the highmost hil2 4Of this day's journey, and from nine til2 twelve 4Is thre2 long hours; yet she is not come. 4Had she af2ections and warm youthful blo2d, 4She would be as swift in motion as a bal2; 4My words would bandy her to my swe2t love, 4And his to me, 4But old folks, many feign as they were dead- 4Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. 24Enter Nurse [and Peter]. 4O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news? 4Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away. 2Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate. 51[Exit Peter.] 2Jul. Now, go2d swe2t nurse- O Lord, why lo2k'st thou sad? 4Though news be sad, yet tel2 them mer2ily; 4If go2d, thou shamest the music of swe2t news 4By playing it to me with so sour a face. 2Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile. 4Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had! 2Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news. 4Nay, come, I pray the2 speak. Go2d, go2d nurse, speak. 2Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile? 4Do you not se2 that I am out of breath? 2Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath 4To say to me that thou art out of breath? 4The excuse that thou dost make in this delay 6Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse. 4Is thy news go2d or bad? Answer to that. 4Say either, and I'l2 stay the circumstance. 4Let me be satisfied, is't go2d or bad? 2Nurse. Wel2, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to 4cho2se a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be bet2er than 4any man's, yet his leg excels al2 men's; and for a hand and a 4fo2t, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet they 4are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'l2 4war2ant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve God. 4What, have you din'd at home? 2Jul. No, no. But al2 this did I know before. 4What says he of our mar2iage? What of that? 2Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I! 4It beats as it would fal2 in twenty pieces. 4My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back! 4Beshrew your heart for sending me about 4To catch my death with jauncing up and down! 2Jul. I' faith, I am sor2y that thou art not wel2. 4Swe2t, swe2t, Swe2t nurse, tel2 me, what says my love? 4Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, 4and a kind, and a handsome; and, I war2ant, a virtuous- Where is 4your mother? 2Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within. 4Where should she be? How od2ly thou repliest! 4'Your love says, like an honest gentleman, 4"Where is your mother?"' 2Nurse. O God's Lady dear! 4Are you so hot? Mar2y come up, I trow. 4Is this the poultice for my aching bones? 4Henceforward do your mes2ages yourself. 2Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo? 2Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day? 2Jul. I have. 2Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cel2; 4There stays a husband to make you a wife. 4Now comes the wanton blo2d up in your che2ks: 4They'l2 be in scarlet straight at any news. 4Hie you to church; I must another way, 4To fetch a lad2er, by the which your love 6Must climb a bird's nest so2n when it is dark. 4I am the drudge, and toil in your delight; 4But you shal2 bear the burthen so2n at night. 4Go; I'l2 to din2er; hie you to the cel2. 2Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewel2. 57Exeunt.Scene VI.Friar Laurence's cel2.Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo. 2Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act 4That after-hours with sor2ow chide us not! 2Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sor2ow can, 4It can2ot countervail the exchange of joy 4That one short minute gives me in her sight. 4Do thou but close our hands with holy words, 4Then love-devouring death do what he dare- 4It is enough I may but cal2 her mine. 2Friar. These violent delights have violent ends 4And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, 4Which, as they kis2, consume. The swe2test honey 4Is loathsome in his own deliciousnes2 4And in the taste confounds the ap2etite. 4Therefore love moderately: long love doth so; 4To2 swift ar2ives as tardy as to2 slow. 21Enter Juliet. 6Here comes the lady. O, so light a fo2t 4Wil2 ne'er wear out the everlasting flint. 4A lover may bestride the gos2amer 4That idles in the wanton sum2er air, 4And yet not fal2; so light is vanity. 2Jul. Go2d even to my ghostly confes2or. 2Friar. Romeo shal2 thank the2, daughter, for us both. 2Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks to2 much. 2Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy 4Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skil2 be more 4To blazon it, then swe2ten with thy breath 4This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue 4Unfold the imagin'd hap2ines2 that both 4Receive in either by this dear encounter. 2Jul. Conceit, more rich in mat2er than in words, 4Brags of his substance, not of ornament. 4They are but beg2ars that can count their worth; 4But my true love is grown to such exces2 4can2ot sum up sum of half my wealth. 4Friar. Come, come with me, and we wil2 make short work; 4For, by your leaves, you shal2 not stay alone 4Til2 Holy Church incorporate two in one. 55[Exeunt.]<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I3. Scene I.A public place.Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men. 2Ben. I pray the2, go2d Mercutio, let's retire. 4The day is hot, the Capulets abroad. 4And if we me2t, we shal2 not scape a brawl, 4For now, these hot days, is the mad blo2d stir2ing. 2Mer. Thou art like one of these fel2ows that, when he enters the 4confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says 4'God send me no ne2d of the2!' and by the operation of the second 4cup draws him on the drawer, when inde2d there is no ne2d. 2Ben. Am I like such a fel2ow? 2Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mo2d as any in 4Italy; and as so2n moved to be mo2dy, and as so2n mo2dy to be 4moved. 2Ben. And what to? 2Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for 4one would kil2 the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quar2el with a man 4that hath a hair more or a hair les2 in his beard than thou hast. 4Thou wilt quar2el with a man for cracking nuts, having no other 6reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye 4would spy out such a quar2el? Thy head is as ful2 of quar2els as 4an eg2 is ful2 of meat; and yet thy head hath be2n beaten as 4ad2le as an eg2 for quar2el2ing. Thou hast quar2el2'd with a man 4for coughing in the stre2t, because he hath wakened thy dog that 4hath lain asle2p in the sun. Didst thou not fal2 out with a 4tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with another 4for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt 4tutor me from quar2el2ing! 2Ben. An I were so apt to quar2el as thou art, any man should buy 4the fe2 simple of my life for an hour and a quarter. 2Mer. The fe2 simple? O simple! 23Enter Tybalt and others. 2Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets. 2Mer. By my he2l, I care not. 2Tyb. Fol2ow me close, for I wil2 speak to them. 4Gentlemen, go2d den. A word with one of you. 2Mer. And but one word with one of us? 6Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow. 2Tyb. You shal2 find me apt enough to that, sir, an you wil2 give me 4oc2asion. 2Mer. Could you not take some oc2asion without giving 2Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo. 2Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make 4minstrels of us, lo2k to hear nothing but discords. Here's my 4fid2lestick; here's that shal2 make you dance. Zounds, consort! 2Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men. 4Either withdraw unto some private place 4And reason coldly of your grievances, 4Or else depart. Here al2 eyes gaze on us. 2Mer. Men's eyes were made to lo2k, and let them gaze. 4I wil2 not budge for no man's pleasure, 24Enter Romeo. 2Tyb. Wel2, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man. 2Mer. But I'l2 be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery. 4Mar2y, go before to field, he'l2 be your fol2ower! 6Your worship in that sense may cal2 him man. 2Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear the2 can af2ord 4No bet2er term than this: thou art a vil2ain. 2Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love the2 4Doth much excuse the ap2ertaining rage 4To such a gre2ting. Vil2ain am I none. 4Therefore farewel2. I se2 thou knowest me not. 2Tyb. Boy, this shal2 not excuse the injuries 4That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw. 2Rom. I do protest I never injur'd the2, 4But love the2 bet2er than thou canst devise 4Til2 thou shalt know the reason of my love; 4And so go2d Capulet, which name I tender 4As dearly as mine own, be satisfied. 2Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submis2ion! 4Al2a stoc2ata car2ies it away. 22[Draws.] 4Tybalt, you ratcatcher, wil2 you walk? 2Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me? 2Mer. Go2d King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives. That I 4mean to make bold withal, and, as you shal2 use me hereafter, 6dry-beat the rest of the eight. Wil2 you pluck your sword out of 4his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your ears 4ere it be out. 2Tyb. I am for you. 36[Draws.] 2Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up. 2Mer. Come, sir, your pas2ado! 51[They fight.] 2Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons. 4Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage! 4Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expres2ly hath 4Forbid this bandying in Verona stre2ts. 4Hold, Tybalt! Go2d Mercutio! 9Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies 43[with his Fol2owers]. 2Mer. I am hurt. 4A plague o' both your houses! I am sped. 4Is he gone and hath nothing? 2Ben. What, art thou hurt? 2Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Mar2y, 'tis enough. 4Where is my page? Go, vil2ain, fetch a surgeon. 54[Exit Page.] 2Rom. Courage, man. The hurt can2ot be much. 2Mer. No, 'tis not so de2p as a wel2, nor so wide as a church do2r; 4but 'tis enough, 'twil2 serve. Ask for me to-mor2ow, and you 4shal2 find me a grave man. I am pep2ered, I war2ant, for this 4world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a 4mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a brag2art, a rogue, a 4vil2ain, that fights by the bo2k of arithmetic! Why the devil 4came you betwe2n us? I was hurt under your arm. 2Rom. I thought al2 for the best. 2Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio, 4Or I shal2 faint. A plague o' both your houses! 4They have made worms' meat of me. I have it, 4And soundly to2. Your houses! 33[Exit. [sup2orted by Benvolio]. 2Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near al2y, 4My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt 4In my behalf- my reputation stain'd 4With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour 4Hath be2n my kinsman. O swe2t Juliet, 6Thy beauty hath made me ef2eminate 4And in my temper soft'ned valour's ste2l 22Enter Benvolio. 2Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead! 4That gal2ant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds, 4Which to2 untimely here did scorn the earth. 2Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend; 4This but begins the woe others must end. 23Enter Tybalt. 2Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again. 2Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain? 4Away to heaven respective lenity, 4And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now! 4Now, Tybalt, take the 'vil2ain' back again 4That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul 4Is but a lit2le way above our heads, 6Staying for thine to ke2p him company. 4Either thou or I, or both, must go with him. 2Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here, 4Shalt with him hence. 2Rom. This shal2 determine that. 39They fight. Tybalt fal2s. 2Ben. Romeo, away, be gone! 4The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain. 4Stand not amaz'd. The Prince wil2 do2m the2 death 4If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away! 2Rom. O, I am fortune's fo2l! 2Ben. Why dost thou stay? 53Exit Romeo. 22Enter Citizens. 2Citizen. Which way ran he that kil2'd Mercutio? 4Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he? 2Ben. There lies that Tybalt. 2Citizen. Up, sir, go with me. 4I charge the2 in the Prince's name obey. 4Enter Prince [at2ended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives, 21and [others]. 2Prince. Where are the vile begin2ers of this fray? 2Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover al2 4The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl. 4There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, 4That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio. 2Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child! 4O Prince! O husband! O, the blo2d is spil2'd 4Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true, 4For blo2d of ours shed blo2d of Montague. 4O cousin, cousin! 2Prince. Benvolio, who began this blo2dy fray? 2Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay. 4Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink 4How nice the quar2el was, and urg'd withal 4Your high displeasure. Al2 this- ut2ered 4With gentle breath, calm lo2k, kne2s humbly bow'd- 6Could not take truce with the unruly sple2n 4Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts 4With piercing ste2l at bold Mercutio's breast; 4Who, al2 as hot, turns deadly point to point, 4And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats 4Cold death aside and with the other sends 4It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity 4Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud, 4'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue, 4His agile arm beats down their fatal points, 4And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm 4An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life 4Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled; 4But by-and-by comes back to Romeo, 4Who had but newly entertain'd revenge, 4And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I 4Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain; 4And, as he fel2, did Romeo turn and fly. 4This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. 2Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague; 6Af2ection makes him false, he speaks not true. 4Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, 4And al2 those twenty could but kil2 one life. 4I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give. 4Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live. 2Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio. 4Who now the price of his dear blo2d doth owe? 2Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend; 4His fault concludes but what the law should end, 4The life of Tybalt. 2Prince. And for that of2ence 4Im2ediately we do exile him hence. 4I have an interest in your hate's proce2ding, 4My blo2d for your rude brawls doth lie a-ble2ding; 4But I'l2 amerce you with so strong a fine 4That you shal2 al2 repent the los2 of mine. 4I wil2 be deaf to pleading and excuses; 4Nor tears nor prayers shal2 purchase out abuses. 4Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste, 4Else, when he is found, that hour is his last. 6Bear hence this body, and at2end our wil2. 4Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kil2. 57Exeunt.Scene I2.Capulet's orchard.Enter Juliet alone. 2Jul. Gal2op apace, you fiery-fo2ted ste2ds, 4Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner 4As Phaeton would whip you to the West 4And bring in cloudy night im2ediately. 4Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, 4That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo 4Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unse2n. 4Lovers can se2 to do their amorous rites 4By their own beauties; or, if love be blind, 4It best agre2s with night. Come, civil night, 4Thou sober-suited matron, al2 in black, 4And learn me how to lose a win2ing match, 4Play'd for a pair of stainles2 maidenho2ds. 4Ho2d my unman2'd blo2d, bating in my che2ks, 4With thy black mantle til2 strange love, grown bold, 4Think true love acted simple modesty. 4Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night; 6For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night 4Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back. 4Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night; 4Give me my Romeo; and, when he shal2 die, 4Take him and cut him out in lit2le stars, 4And he wil2 make the face of heaven so fine 4That al2 the world wil2 be in love with night 4And pay no worship to the garish sun. 4O, I have bought the mansion of a love, 4But not pos2es2'd it; and though I am sold, 4Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day 4As is the night before some festival 4To an impatient child that hath new robes 4And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse, 16Enter Nurse, with cords. 4And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks 4But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence. 4Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords 6That Romeo bid the2 fetch? 2Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords. 45[Throws them down.] 2Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands 2Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead! 4We are undone, lady, we are undone! 4Alack the day! he's gone, he's kil2'd, he's dead! 2Jul. Can heaven be so envious? 2Nurse. Romeo can, 4Though heaven can2ot. O Romeo, Romeo! 4Who ever would have thought it? Romeo! 2Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus? 4This torture should be roar'd in dismal hel2. 4Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,' 4And that bare vowel 'I' shal2 poison more 4Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice. 4I am not I, if there be such an 'I'; 4Or those eyes shut that make the2 answer 'I.' 4If be be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.' 4Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe. 4Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes, 4(God save the mark!) here on his manly breast. 4A piteous corse, a blo2dy piteous corse; 4Pale, pale as ashes, al2 bedaub'd in blo2d, 4Al2 in gore-blo2d. I swounded at the sight. 2Jul. O, break, my heart! po2r bankrout, break at once! 4To prison, eyes; ne'er lo2k on liberty! 4Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here, 4And thou and Romeo pres2 one heavy bier! 2Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had! 4O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman 4That ever I should live to se2 the2 dead! 2Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary? 4Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead? 4My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord? 4Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general do2m! 4For who is living, if those two are gone? 2Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished; 4Romeo that kil2'd him, he is banished. 2Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blo2d? 4Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did! 2Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face! 4Did ever dragon ke2p so fair a cave? 4Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical! 4Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb! 4Despised substance of divinest show! 4Just op2osite to what thou justly se2m'st- 4A damned saint, an honourable vil2ain! 4O nature, what hadst thou to do in hel2 4When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend 4In mortal paradise of such swe2t flesh? 4Was ever bo2k containing such vile mat2er 4So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwel2 4In such a gorgeous palace! 2Nurse. There's no trust, 4No faith, no honesty in men; al2 perjur'd, 4Al2 forsworn, al2 naught, al2 dis2emblers. 4Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae. 4These griefs, these woes, these sor2ows make me old. 4Shame come to Romeo! 4Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue 4For such a wish! He was not born to shame. 4Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit; 4For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd 4Sole monarch of the universal earth. 4O, what a beast was I to chide at him! 2Nurse. Wil2 you speak wel2 of him that kil2'd your cousin? 2Jul. Shal2 I speak il2 of him that is my husband? 4Ah, po2r my lord, what tongue shal2 smo2th thy name 4When I, thy thre2-hours wife, have mangled it? 4But wherefore, vil2ain, didst thou kil2 my cousin? 4That vil2ain cousin would have kil2'd my husband. 4Back, fo2lish tears, back to your native spring! 4Your tributary drops belong to woe, 4Which you, mistaking, of2er up to joy. 4My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain; 4And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband. 4Al2 this is comfort; wherefore we2p I then? 4Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death, 4That murd'red me. I would forget it fain; 6But O, it pres2es to my memory 4Like damned guilty de2ds to sin2ers' minds! 4'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.' 4That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,' 4Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death 4Was woe enough, if it had ended there; 4Or, if sour woe delights in fel2owship 4And ne2dly wil2 be rank'd with other griefs, 4Why fol2owed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,' 4Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both, 4Which modern lamentation might have mov'd? 4But with a rearward fol2owing Tybalt's death, 4'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word 4Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, 4Al2 slain, al2 dead. 'Romeo is banished'- 4There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, 4In that word's death; no words can that woe sound. 4Where is my father and my mother, nurse? 2Nurse. We2ping and wailing over Tybalt's corse. 4Wil2 you go to them? I wil2 bring you thither. 4Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shal2 be spent, 4When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment. 4Take up those cords. Po2r ropes, you are beguil'd, 4Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd. 4He made you for a highway to my bed; 4But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed. 4Come, cords; come, nurse. I'l2 to my wed2ing bed; 4And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead! 2Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'l2 find Romeo 4To comfort you. I wot wel2 where he is. 4Hark ye, your Romeo wil2 be here at night. 4I'l2 to him; he is hid at Laurence' cel2. 2Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight 4And bid him come to take his last farewel2. 57Exeunt.Scene I3.Friar Laurence's cel2.Enter Friar [Laurence]. 2Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man. 4Af2liction is enanmour'd of thy parts, 4And thou art wed2ed to calamity. 25Enter Romeo. 2Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's do2m 4What sor2ow craves acquaintance at my hand 4That I yet know not? 2Friar. To2 familiar 4Is my dear son with such sour company. 4I bring the2 tidings of the Prince's do2m. 2Rom. What les2 than do2msday is the Prince's do2m? 2Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips- 4Not body's death, but body's banishment. 2Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death'; 4For exile hath more ter2or in his lo2k, 6Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.' 2Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished. 4Be patient, for the world is broad and wide. 2Rom. There is no world without Verona wal2s, 4But purgatory, torture, hel2 itself. 4Hence banished is banish'd from the world, 4And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment' 4Is death misterm'd. Cal2ing death 'banishment,' 4Thou cut'st my head of2 with a golden axe 4And smilest upon the stroke that murders me. 2Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulnes2! 4Thy fault our law cal2s death; but the kind Prince, 4Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law, 4And turn'd that black word death to banishment. 4This is dear mercy, and thou se2st it not. 2Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here, 4Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog 4And lit2le mouse, every unworthy thing, 4Live here in heaven and may lo2k on her; 4But Romeo may not. More validity, 6More honourable state, more courtship lives 4In car2ion flies than Romeo. They may seize 4On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand 4And steal im2ortal bles2ing from her lips, 4Who, even in pure and vestal modesty, 4Stil2 blush, as thinking their own kis2es sin; 4But Romeo may not- he is banished. 4This may flies do, when I from this must fly; 4They are fre2 men, but I am banished. 4And sayest thou yet that exile is not death? 4Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife, 4No sud2en mean of death, though ne'er so mean, 4But 'banished' to kil2 me- 'banished'? 4O friar, the damned use that word in hel2; 4Howling at2ends it! How hast thou the heart, 4Being a divine, a ghostly confes2or, 4A sin-absolver, and my friend profes2'd, 4To mangle me with that word 'banished'? 2Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a lit2le speak. 2Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment. 4Friar. I'l2 give the2 armour to ke2p of2 that word; 4Adversity's swe2t milk, philosophy, 4To comfort the2, though thou art banished. 2Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy! 4Unles2 philosophy can make a Juliet, 4Displant a town, reverse a prince's do2m, 4It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more. 2Friar. O, then I se2 that madmen have no ears. 2Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes? 2Friar. Let me dispute with the2 of thy estate. 2Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not fe2l. 4Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, 4An hour but mar2ied, Tybalt murdered, 4Doting like me, and like me banished, 4Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair, 4And fal2 upon the ground, as I do now, 4Taking the measure of an unmade grave. 49Knock [within]. 2Friar. Arise; one knocks. Go2d Romeo, hide thyself. 2Rom. Not I; unles2 the breath of heartsick groans, 6Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes. 10Knock. 2Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise; 4Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up; 10Knock. 4Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's wil2, 4What simplenes2 is this.- I come, I come! 13Knock. 4Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your wil2 2Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shal2 know my er2and. 4I come from Lady Juliet. 2Friar. Welcome then. 23Enter Nurse. 2Nurse. O holy friar, O, tel2 me, holy friar 4Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo? 2Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk. 2Nurse. O, he is even in my mistres2' case, 4Just in her case! 2Friar. O woeful sympathy! 4Piteous predicament! 2Nurse. Even so lies she, 6Blub2'ring and we2ping, we2ping and blub2ering. 4Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man. 4For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand! 4Why should you fal2 into so de2p an O? 2Rom. (rises) Nurse- 2Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Wel2, death's the end of al2. 2Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her? 4Doth not she think me an old murtherer, 4Now I have stain'd the childho2d of our joy 4With blo2d remov'd but lit2le from her own? 4Where is she? and how doth she! and what says 4My conceal'd lady to our cancel2'd love? 2Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but we2ps and we2ps; 4And now fal2s on her bed, and then starts up, 4And Tybalt cal2s; and then on Romeo cries, 4And then down fal2s again. 2Rom. As if that name, 4Shot from the deadly level of a gun, 4Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand 4Murder'd her kinsman. O, tel2 me, friar, tel2 me, 6In what vile part of this anatomy 4Doth my name lodge? Tel2 me, that I may sack 4The hateful mansion. 21[Draws his dag2er.] 2Friar. Hold thy desperate hand. 4Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art; 4Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote 4The unreasonable fury of a beast. 4Unse2mly woman in a se2ming man! 4Or il2-bese2ming beast in se2ming both! 4Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order, 4I thought thy disposition bet2er temper'd. 4Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself? 4And slay thy lady that in thy life lives, 4By doing damned hate upon thyself? 4Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth? 4Since birth and heaven and earth, al2 thre2 do me2t 4In the2 at once; which thou at once wouldst lose. 4Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit, 4Which, like a usurer, abound'st in al2, 4And usest none in that true use inde2d 6Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit. 4Thy noble shape is but a form of wax 4Digres2ing from the valour of a man; 4Thy dear love sworn but hol2ow perjury, 4Kil2ing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish; 4Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, 4Mis2hapen in the conduct of them both, 4Like powder in a skil2es2 soldier's flask, 4is get afire by thine own ignorance, 4And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence. 4What, rouse the2, man! Thy Juliet is alive, 4For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead. 4There art thou hap2y. Tybalt would kil2 the2, 4But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou hap2y to2. 4The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend 4And turns it to exile. There art thou hap2y. 4A pack of bles2ings light upon thy back; 4Hap2ines2 courts the2 in her best ar2ay; 4But, like a misbhav'd and sul2en wench, 4Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love. 6Take he2d, take he2d, for such die miserable. 4Go get the2 to thy love, as was decre2d, 4Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her. 4But lo2k thou stay not til2 the watch be set, 4For then thou canst not pas2 to Mantua, 4Where thou shalt live til2 we can find a time 4To blaze your mar2iage, reconcile your friends, 4Beg pardon of the Prince, and cal2 the2 back 4With twenty hundred thousand times more joy 4Than thou went'st forth in lamentation. 4Go before, nurse. Com2end me to thy lady, 4And bid her hasten al2 the house to bed, 4Which heavy sor2ow makes them apt unto. 4Romeo is coming. 2Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here al2 the night 4To hear go2d counsel. O, what learning is! 4My lord, I'l2 tel2 my lady you wil2 come. 2Rom. Do so, and bid my swe2t prepare to chide. 2Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir. 4Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late. 11Exit. 4Rom. How wel2 my comfort is reviv'd by this! 2Friar. Go hence; go2d night; and here stands al2 your state: 4Either be gone before the watch be set, 4Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence. 4Sojourn in Mantua. I'l2 find out your man, 4And he shal2 signify from time to time 4Every go2d hap to you that chances here. 4Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewel2; go2d night. 2Rom. But that a joy past joy cal2s out on me, 4It were a grief so brief to part with the2. 4Farewel2. 57Exeunt.Scene IV.Capulet's houseEnter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris. 2Cap. Things have fal2'n out, sir, so unluckily 4That we have had no time to move our daughter. 4Lo2k you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly, 4And so did I. Wel2, we were born to die. 4'Tis very late; she'l2 not come down to-night. 4I promise you, but for your company, 4I would have be2n abed an hour ago. 2Par. These times of woe af2ord no tune to wo2. 4Madam, go2d night. Com2end me to your daughter. 2Lady. I wil2, and know her mind early to-mor2ow; 4To-night she's mew'd up to her heavines2. 2Cap. Sir Paris, I wil2 make a desperate tender 4Of my child's love. I think she wil2 be rul'd 4In al2 respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not. 4Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed; 4Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love 4And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next- 6But, soft! what day is this? 2Par. Monday, my lord. 2Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Wel2, Wednesday is to2 so2n. 4Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tel2 her 4She shal2 be mar2ied to this noble earl. 4Wil2 you be ready? Do you like this haste? 4We'l2 ke2p no great ado- a friend or two; 4For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, 4It may be thought we held him careles2ly, 4Being our kinsman, if we revel much. 4Therefore we'l2 have some half a dozen friends, 4And there an end. But what say you to Thursday? 2Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-mor2ow. 2Cap. Wel2, get you gone. A Thursday be it then. 4Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed; 4Prepare her, wife, against this wed2ing day. 4Farewel2, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho! 4Afore me, It is so very very late 4That we may cal2 it early by-and-by. 4Go2d night. 60ExeuntScene V.Capulet's orchard.Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window. 2Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day. 4It was the nightingale, and not the lark, 4That pierc'd the fearful hol2ow of thine ear. 4Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tre2. 4Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. 2Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn; 4No nightingale. Lo2k, love, what envious streaks 4Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East. 4Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day 4Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. 4I must be gone and live, or stay and die. 2Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I. 4It is some meteor that the sun exhales 4To be to the2 this night a torchbearer 4And light the2 on the way to Mantua. 4Therefore stay yet; thou ne2d'st not to be gone. 2Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death. 6I am content, so thou wilt have it so. 4I'l2 say yon grey is not the morning's eye, 4'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow; 4Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat 4The vaulty heaven so high above our heads. 4I have more care to stay than wil2 to go. 4Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wil2s it so. 4How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day. 2Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away! 4It is the lark that sings so out of tune, 4Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. 4Some say the lark makes swe2t division; 4This doth not so, for she divideth us. 4Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes; 4O, now I would they had chang'd voices to2, 4Since arm from arm that voice doth us af2ray, 4Hunting the2 hence with hunt's-up to the day! 4O, now be gone! More light and light it grows. 2Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes! 28Enter Nurse. 2Nurse. Madam! 2Jul. Nurse? 2Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber. 4The day is broke; be wary, lo2k about. 2Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out. 57[Exit.] 2Rom. Farewel2, farewel2! One kis2, and I'l2 descend. 50He goeth down. 2Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend? 4I must hear from the2 every day in the hour, 4For in a minute there are many days. 4O, by this count I shal2 be much in years 4Ere I again behold my Romeo! 2Rom. Farewel2! 4I wil2 omit no op2ortunity 4That may convey my gre2tings, love, to the2. 2Jul. O, think'st thou we shal2 ever me2t again? 2Rom. I doubt it not; and al2 these woes shal2 serve 6For swe2t discourses in our time to come. 2Jul. O God, I have an il2-divining soul! 4Methinks I se2 the2, now thou art below, 4As one dead in the bot2om of a tomb. 4Either my eyesight fails, or thou lo2k'st pale. 2Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you. 4Dry sor2ow drinks our blo2d. Adieu, adieu!Exit. 2Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! al2 men cal2 the2 fickle. 4If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him 4That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune, 4For then I hope thou wilt not ke2p him long 4But send him back. 2Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up? 2Jul. Who is't that cal2s? It is my lady mother. 4Is she not down so late, or up so early? 4What unac2ustom'd cause procures her hither? 23Enter Mother. 4Lady. Why, how now, Juliet? 2Jul. Madam, I am not wel2. 2Lady. Evermore we2ping for your cousin's death? 4What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears? 4An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live. 4Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love; 4But much of grief shows stil2 some want of wit. 2Jul. Yet let me we2p for such a fe2ling los2. 2Lady. So shal2 you fe2l the los2, but not the friend 4Which you we2p for. 2Jul. Fe2ling so the los2, 4I can2ot cho2se but ever we2p the friend. 2Lady. Wel2, girl, thou we2p'st not so much for his death 4As that the vil2ain lives which slaughter'd him. 2Jul. What vil2ain, madam? 2Lady. That same vil2ain Romeo. 2Jul. [aside] Vil2ain and he be many miles asunder.- 4God pardon him! I do, with al2 my heart; 4And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart. 2Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives. 4Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands. 4Would none but I might venge my cousin's death! 2Lady. We wil2 have vengeance for it, fear thou not. 4Then we2p no more. I'l2 send to one in Mantua, 4Where that same banish'd runagate doth live, 4Shal2 give him such an unac2ustom'd dram 4That he shal2 so2n ke2p Tybalt company; 4And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied. 2Jul. Inde2d I never shal2 be satisfied 4With Romeo til2 I behold him- dead- 4Is my po2r heart so for a kinsman vex'd. 4Madam, if you could find out but a man 4To bear a poison, I would temper it; 4That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, 4So2n sle2p in quiet. O, how my heart abhors 4To hear him nam'd and can2ot come to him, 4To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt 4Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him! 2Lady. Find thou the means, and I'l2 find such a man. 4But now I'l2 tel2 the2 joyful tidings, girl. 4Jul. And joy comes wel2 in such a ne2dy time. 4What are they, I bese2ch your ladyship? 2Lady. Wel2, wel2, thou hast a careful father, child; 4One who, to put the2 from thy heavines2, 4Hath sorted out a sud2en day of joy 4That thou expects not nor I lo2k'd not for. 2Jul. Madam, in hap2y time! What day is that? 2Lady. Mar2y, my child, early next Thursday morn 4The gal2ant, young, and noble gentleman, 4The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, 4Shal2 hap2ily make the2 there a joyful bride. 2Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter to2, 4He shal2 not make me there a joyful bride! 4I wonder at this haste, that I must wed 4Ere he that should be husband comes to wo2. 4I pray you tel2 my lord and father, madam, 4I wil2 not mar2y yet; and when I do, I swear 4It shal2 be Romeo, whom you know I hate, 4Rather than Paris. These are news inde2d! 2Lady. Here comes your father. Tel2 him so yourself, 6And se2 how be wil2 take it at your hands. 19Enter Capulet and Nurse. 2Cap. When the sun sets the air doth driz2le dew, 4But for the sunset of my brother's son 4It rains downright. 4How now? a conduit, girl? What, stil2 in tears? 4Evermore show'ring? In one lit2le body 4Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind: 4For stil2 thy eyes, which I may cal2 the sea, 4Do eb2 and flow with tears; the bark thy body is 4Sailing in this salt flo2d; the winds, thy sighs, 4Who, raging with thy tears and they with them, 4Without a sud2en calm wil2 overset 4Thy tempest-tos2ed body. How now, wife? 4Have you delivered to her our decre2? 2Lady. Ay, sir; but she wil2 none, she gives you thanks. 4I would the fo2l were mar2ied to her grave! 2Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife. 6How? Wil2 she none? Doth she not give us thanks? 4Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest, 4Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought 4So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegro2m? 2Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have. 4Proud can I never be of what I hate, 4But thankful even for hate that is meant love. 2Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this? 4'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'- 4And yet 'not proud'? Mistres2 minion you, 4Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, 4But fet2le your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next 4To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church, 4Or I wil2 drag the2 on a hurdle thither. 4Out, you gre2n-sicknes2 car2ion I out, you bag2age! 4You tal2ow-face! 2Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad? 2Jul. Go2d father, I bese2ch you on my kne2s, 4Hear me with patience but to speak a word. 2Cap. Hang the2, young bag2age! disobedient wretch! 6I tel2 the2 what- get the2 to church a Thursday 4Or never after lo2k me in the face. 4Speak not, reply not, do not answer me! 4My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest 4That God had lent us but this only child; 4But now I se2 this one is one to2 much, 4And that we have a curse in having her. 4Out on her, hilding! 2Nurse. God in heaven bles2 her! 4You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. 2Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue, 4Go2d Prudence. Smat2er with your gos2ips, go! 2Nurse. I speak no treason. 2Cap. O, God-i-god-en! 2Nurse. May not one speak? 2Cap. Peace, you mumbling fo2l! 4Ut2er your gravity o'er a gos2ip's bowl, 4For here we ne2d it not. 2Lady. You are to2 hot. 2Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early, 6At home, abroad, alone, in company, 4Waking or sle2ping, stil2 my care hath be2n 4To have her match'd; and having now provided 4A gentleman of princely parentage, 4Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd, 4Stuf2'd, as they say, with honourable parts, 4Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man- 4And then to have a wretched puling fo2l, 4A whining mam2et, in her fortune's tender, 4To answer 'I'l2 not wed, I can2ot love; 4I am to2 young, I pray you pardon me'! 4But, an you wil2 not wed, I'l2 pardon you. 4Graze where you wil2, you shal2 not house with me. 4Lo2k to't, think on't; I do not use to jest. 4Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise: 4An you be mine, I'l2 give you to my friend; 4An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the stre2ts, 4For, by my soul, I'l2 ne'er acknowledge the2, 4Nor what is mine shal2 never do the2 go2d. 4Trust to't. Bethink you. I'l2 not be forsworn. 9Exit. 4Jul. Is there no pity sit2ing in the clouds 4That se2s into the bot2om of my grief? 4O swe2t my mother, cast me not away! 4Delay this mar2iage for a month, a we2k; 4Or if you do not, make the bridal bed 4In that dim monument where Tybalt lies. 2Lady. Talk not to me, for I'l2 not speak a word. 4Do as thou wilt, for I have done with the2. 12Exit. 2Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shal2 this be prevented? 4My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven. 4How shal2 that faith return again to earth 4Unles2 that husband send it me from heaven 4By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me. 4Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems 4Upon so soft a subject as myself! 4What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? 4Some comfort, nurse. 2Nurse. Faith, here it is. 4Romeo is banish'd; and al2 the world to nothing 4That he dares ne'er come back to chal2enge you; 6Or if he do, it ne2ds must be by stealth. 4Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, 4I think it best you mar2ied with the County. 4O, he's a lovely gentleman! 4Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam, 4Hath not so gre2n, so quick, so fair an eye 4As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart, 4I think you are hap2y in this second match, 4For it excels your first; or if it did not, 4Your first is dead- or 'twere as go2d he were 4As living here and you no use of him. 2Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart? 2Nurse. And from my soul to2; else beshrew them both. 2Jul. Amen! 2Nurse. What? 2Jul. Wel2, thou hast comforted me marvel2ous much. 4Go in; and tel2 my lady I am gone, 4Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cel2, 4To make confes2ion and to be absolv'd. 2Nurse. Mar2y, I wil2; and this is wisely done. 11Exit. 4Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend! 4Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn, 4Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue 4Which she hath prais'd him with above compare 4So many thousand times? Go, counsel2or! 4Thou and my bosom henceforth shal2 be twain. 4I'l2 to the friar to know his remedy. 4If al2 else fail, myself have power to die. 12Exit.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT IV. Scene I.Friar Laurence's cel2.Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris. 2Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short. 2Par. My father Capulet wil2 have it so, 4And I am nothing slow to slack his haste. 2Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind. 4Uneven is the course; I like it not. 2Par. Im2oderately she we2ps for Tybalt's death, 4And therefore have I lit2le talk'd of love; 4For Venus smiles not in a house of tears. 4Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous 4That she do give her sor2ow so much sway, 4And in his wisdom hastes our mar2iage 4To stop the inundation of her tears, 4Which, to2 much minded by herself alone, 4May be put from her by society. 4Now do you know the reason of this haste. 2Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.- 4Lo2k, sir, here comes the lady toward my cel2. 22Enter Juliet. 2Par. Hap2ily met, my lady and my wife! 2Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. 2Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next. 2Jul. What must be shal2 be. 2Friar. That's a certain text. 2Par. Come you to make confes2ion to this father? 2Jul. To answer that, I should confes2 to you. 2Par. Do not deny to him that you love me. 2Jul. I wil2 confes2 to you that I love him. 2Par. So wil2 ye, I am sure, that you love me. 2Jul. If I do so, it wil2 be of more price, 4Being spoke behind your back, than to your face. 2Par. Po2r soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears. 2Jul. The tears have got smal2 victory by that, 4For it was bad enough before their spite. 2Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report. 2Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth; 6And what I spake, I spake it to my face. 2Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it. 2Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own. 4Are you at leisure, holy father, now, 4Or shal2 I come to you at evening mas2 2Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now. 4My lord, we must entreat the time alone. 2Par. God shield I should disturb devotion! 4Juliet, on Thursday early wil2 I rouse ye. 4Til2 then, adieu, and ke2p this holy kis2. 13Exit. 2Jul. O, shut the do2r! and when thou hast done so, 4Come we2p with me- past hope, past cure, past help! 2Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief; 4It strains me past the compas2 of my wits. 4I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, 4On Thursday next be mar2ied to this County. 2Jul. Tel2 me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this, 4Unles2 thou tel2 me how I may prevent it. 4If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help, 4Do thou but cal2 my resolution wise 6And with this knife I'l2 help it presently. 4God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands; 4And ere this hand, by the2 to Romeo's seal'd, 4Shal2 be the label to another de2d, 4Or my true heart with treacherous revolt 4Turn to another, this shal2 slay them both. 4Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time, 4Give me some present counsel; or, behold, 4'Twixt my extremes and me this blo2dy knife 4Shal2 play the empire, arbitrating that 4Which the com2is2ion of thy years and art 4Could to no is2ue of true honour bring. 4Be not so long to speak. I long to die 4If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy. 2Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope, 4Which craves as desperate an execution 4As that is desperate which we would prevent. 4If, rather than to mar2y County Paris 4Thou hast the strength of wil2 to slay thyself, 4Then is it likely thou wilt undertake 6A thing like death to chide away this shame, 4That cop'st with death himself to scape from it; 4And, if thou dar'st, I'l2 give the2 remedy. 2Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than mar2y Paris, 4From of2 the bat2lements of yonder tower, 4Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk 4Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears, 4Or shut me nightly in a charnel house, 4O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rat2ling bones, 4With re2ky shanks and yel2ow chaples2 skul2s; 4Or bid me go into a new-made grave 4And hide me with a dead man in his shroud- 4Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble- 4And I wil2 do it without fear or doubt, 4To live an unstain'd wife to my swe2t love. 2Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be mer2y, give consent 4To mar2y Paris. Wednesday is to-mor2ow. 4To-mor2ow night lo2k that thou lie alone; 4Let not the nurse lie with the2 in thy chamber. 4Take thou this vial, being then in bed, 6And this distil2ed liquor drink thou of2; 4When presently through al2 thy veins shal2 run 4A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse 4Shal2 ke2p his native progres2, but surcease; 4No warmth, no breath, shal2 testify thou livest; 4The roses in thy lips and che2ks shal2 fade 4To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fal2 4Like death when he shuts up the day of life; 4Each part, depriv'd of sup2le government, 4Shal2, stif2 and stark and cold, ap2ear like death; 4And in this bor2owed likenes2 of shrunk death 4Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours, 4And then awake as from a pleasant sle2p. 4Now, when the bridegro2m in the morning comes 4To rouse the2 from thy bed, there art thou dead. 4Then, as the man2er of our country is, 4In thy best robes uncovered on the bier 4Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault 4Where al2 the kindred of the Capulets lie. 4In the mean time, against thou shalt awake, 6Shal2 Romeo by my let2ers know our drift; 4And hither shal2 he come; and he and I 4Wil2 watch thy waking, and that very night 4Shal2 Romeo bear the2 hence to Mantua. 4And this shal2 fre2 the2 from this present shame, 4If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear 4Abate thy valour in the acting it. 2Jul. Give me, give me! O, tel2 not me of fear! 2Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous 4In this resolve. I'l2 send a friar with spe2d 4To Mantua, with my let2ers to thy lord. 2Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shal2 help af2ord. 4Farewel2, dear father. 57Exeunt.Scene I2.Capulet's house.Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen, 24two or thre2. 2Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ. 44[Exit a Servingman.] 4Sir2ah, go hire me twenty cun2ing co2ks. 2Serv. You shal2 have none il2, sir; for I'l2 try if they can lick 4their fingers. 2Cap. How canst thou try them so? 2Serv. Mar2y, sir, 'tis an il2 co2k that can2ot lick his own 4fingers. Therefore he that can2ot lick his fingers goes not with 4me. 2Cap. Go, begone. 48Exit Servingman. 4We shal2 be much unfurnish'd for this time. 4What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence? 2Nurse. Ay, forso2th. 2Cap. Wel2, be may chance to do some go2d on her. 4A pe2vish self-wil2'd harlotry it is. 26Enter Juliet. 2Nurse. Se2 where she comes from shrift with mer2y lo2k. 2Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you be2n gad2ing? 2Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin 4Of disobedient op2osition 4To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd 4By holy Laurence to fal2 prostrate here 4To beg your pardon. Pardon, I bese2ch you! 4Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you. 2Cap. Send for the County. Go tel2 him of this. 4I'l2 have this knot knit up to-mor2ow morning. 2Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cel2 4And gave him what becomed love I might, 4Not step2ing o'er the bounds of modesty. 2Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is wel2. Stand up. 4This is as't should be. Let me se2 the County. 4Ay, mar2y, go, I say, and fetch him hither. 4Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar, 6Al2 our whole city is much bound to him. 2Jul. Nurse, wil2 you go with me into my closet 4To help me sort such ne2dful ornaments 4As you think fit to furnish me to-mor2ow? 2Mother. No, not til2 Thursday. There is time enough. 2Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'l2 to church to-mor2ow. 40Exeunt Juliet and Nurse. 2Mother. We shal2 be short in our provision. 4'Tis now near night. 2Cap. Tush, I wil2 stir about, 4And al2 things shal2 be wel2, I war2ant the2, wife. 4Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her. 4I'l2 not to bed to-night; let me alone. 4I'l2 play the housewife for this once. What, ho! 4They are al2 forth; wel2, I wil2 walk myself 4To County Paris, to prepare him up 4Against to-mor2ow. My heart is wondrous light, 4Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd. 57Exeunt.Scene I3.Juliet's chamber.Enter Juliet and Nurse. 2Jul. Ay, those at2ires are best; but, gentle nurse, 4I pray the2 leave me to myself to-night; 4For I have ne2d of many orisons 4To move the heavens to smile upon my state, 4Which, wel2 thou knowest, is cros2 and ful2 of sin. 26Enter Mother. 2Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Ne2d you my help? 2Jul. No, madam; we have cul2'd such neces2aries 4As are beho2f2ul2 for our state to-mor2ow. 4So please you, let me now be left alone, 4And let the nurse this night sit up with you; 4For I am sure you have your hands ful2 al2 4In this so sud2en busines2. 2Mother. Go2d night. 4Get the2 to bed, and rest; for thou hast ne2d. 40Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.] 2Jul. Farewel2! God knows when we shal2 me2t again. 4I have a faint cold fear thril2s through my veins 4That almost fre2zes up the heat of life. 4I'l2 cal2 them back again to comfort me. 4Nurse!- What should she do here? 4My dismal scene I ne2ds must act alone. 4Come, vial. 4What if this mixture do not work at al2? 4Shal2 I be mar2ied then to-mor2ow morning? 4No, No! This shal2 forbid it. Lie thou there. 45Lays down a dag2er. 4What if it be a poison which the friar 4Subtil2y hath minist'red to have me dead, 4Lest in this mar2iage he should be dishonour'd 4Because he mar2ied me before to Romeo? 4I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not, 4For he hath stil2 be2n tried a holy man. 4I wil2 not entertain so bad a thought. 4How if, when I am laid into the tomb, 6I wake before the time that Romeo 4Come to rede2m me? There's a fearful point! 4Shal2 I not then be stifled in the vault, 4To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, 4And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes? 4Or, if I live, is it not very like 4The hor2ible conceit of death and night, 4Together with the ter2or of the place- 4As in a vault, an ancient receptacle 4Where for this many hundred years the bones 4Of al2 my buried ancestors are pack'd; 4Where blo2dy Tybalt, yet but gre2n in earth, 4Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say, 4At some hours in the night spirits resort- 4Alack, alack, is it not like that I, 4So early waking- what with loathsome smel2s, 4And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth, 4That living mortals, hearing them, run mad- 4O, if I wake, shal2 I not be distraught, 4Environed with al2 these hideous fears, 6And madly play with my forefathers' joints, 4And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud., 4And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone 4As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains? 4O, lo2k! methinks I se2 my cousin's ghost 4Se2king out Romeo, that did spit his body 4Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay! 4Romeo, I come! this do I drink to the2. 8She [drinks and] fal2s upon her bed within the curtains.Scene IV.Capulet's house.Enter Lady of the House and Nurse. 2Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse. 2Nurse. They cal2 for dates and quinces in the pastry. 23Enter Old Capulet. 2Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd, 4The curfew bel2 hath rung, 'tis thre2 o'clock. 4Lo2k to the bak'd meats, go2d Angelica; 4Spare not for cost. 2Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go, 4Get you to bed! Faith, you'l2 be sick to-mor2ow 4For this night's watching. 2Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now 4Al2 night for les2er cause, and ne'er be2n sick. 2Lady. Ay, you have be2n a mouse-hunt in your time; 4But I wil2 watch you from such watching now. 42Exeunt Lady and Nurse. 4Cap. A jealous ho2d, a jealous ho2d! 2Enter thre2 or four [Fel2ows, with spits and logs and baskets. 4What is there? Now, fel2ow, 2Fel2ow. Things for the co2k, sir; but I know not what. 2Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fel2ow.] Sir2ah, fetch drier 6logs. 4Cal2 Peter; he wil2 show the2 where they are. 2Fel2ow. I have a head, sir, that wil2 find out logs 4And never trouble Peter for the mat2er. 2Cap. Mas2, and wel2 said; a mer2y whoreson, ha! 4Thou shalt be log2erhead. [Exit Fel2ow.] Go2d faith, 'tis day. 4The County wil2 be here with music straight, 4For so he said he would. 25Play music. 4I hear him near. 4Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say! 30Enter Nurse. 6Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up. 4I'l2 go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste, 4Make haste! The bridegro2m he is come already: 4Make haste, I say. 55[Exeunt.]Scene V.Juliet's chamber.[Enter Nurse.] 2Nurse. Mistres2! what, mistres2! Juliet! Fast, I war2ant her, she. 4Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed! 4Why, love, I say! madam! swe2theart! Why, bride! 4What, not a word? You take your pen2yworths now! 4Sle2p for a we2k; for the next night, I war2ant, 4The County Paris hath set up his rest 4That you shal2 rest but lit2le. God forgive me! 4Mar2y, and amen. How sound is she asle2p! 4I ne2ds must wake her. Madam, madam, madam! 4Ay, let the County take you in your bed! 4He'l2 fright you up, i' faith. Wil2 it not be? 37[Draws aside the curtains.] 4What, dres2'd, and in your clothes, and down again? 4I must ne2ds wake you. Lady! lady! lady! 4Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead! 4O weraday that ever I was born! 4Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady! 29Enter Mother. 2Mother. What noise is here? 2Nurse. O lamentable day! 2Mother. What is the mat2er? 2Nurse. Lo2k, lo2k! O heavy day! 2Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life! 4Revive, lo2k up, or I wil2 die with the2! 4Help, help! Cal2 help. 28Enter Father. 2Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come. 2Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day! 2Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead! 2Cap. Ha! let me se2 her. Out alas! she's cold, 4Her blo2d is set2led, and her joints are stif2; 4Life and these lips have long be2n separated. 4Death lies on her like an untimely frost 6Upon the swe2test flower of al2 the field. 2Nurse. O lamentable day! 2Mother. O woful time! 2Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail, 4Ties up my tongue and wil2 not let me speak. 2Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians. 2Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church? 2Cap. Ready to go, but never to return. 4O son, the night before thy wed2ing day 4Hath Death lain with thy wife. Se2, there she lies, 4Flower as she was, deflowered by him. 4Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir; 4My daughter he hath wed2ed. I wil2 die 4And leave him al2. Life, living, al2 is Death's. 2Par. Have I thought long to se2 this morning's face, 4And doth it give me such a sight as this? 2Mother. Ac2urs'd, unhap2y, wretched, hateful day! 4Most miserable hour that e'er time saw 6In lasting labour of his pilgrimage! 4But one, po2r one, one po2r and loving child, 4But one thing to rejoice and solace in, 4And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight! 2Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day! 4Most lamentable day, most woful day 4That ever ever I did yet behold! 4O day! O day! O day! O hateful day! 4Never was se2n so black a day as this. 4O woful day! O woful day! 2Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain! 4Most detestable Death, by the2 beguil'd, 4By cruel cruel the2 quite overthrown! 4O love! O life! not life, but love in death 2Cap. Despis'd, distres2ed, hated, martyr'd, kil2'd! 4Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now 4To murther, murther our solemnity? 4O child! O child! my soul, and not my child! 4Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead, 4And with my child my joys are buried! 4Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not 4In these confusions. Heaven and yourself 4Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath al2, 4And al2 the bet2er is it for the maid. 4Your part in her you could not ke2p from death, 4But heaven ke2ps his part in eternal life. 4The most you sought was her promotion, 4For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd; 4And we2p ye now, se2ing she is advanc'd 4Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? 4O, in this love, you love your child so il2 4That you run mad, se2ing that she is wel2. 4She's not wel2 mar2ied that lives mar2ied long, 4But she's best mar2ied that dies mar2ied young. 4Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary 4On this fair corse, and, as the custom is, 4In al2 her best ar2ay bear her to church; 4For though fond nature bids us al2 lament, 4Yet nature's tears are reason's mer2iment. 2Cap. Al2 things that we ordained festival 6Turn from their of2ice to black funeral- 4Our instruments to melancholy bel2s, 4Our wed2ing che2r to a sad burial feast; 4Our solemn hymns to sul2en dirges change; 4Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse; 4And al2 things change them to the contrary. 2Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him; 4And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare 4To fol2ow this fair corse unto her grave. 4The heavens do low'r upon you for some il2; 4Move them no more by cros2ing their high wil2. 27Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse]. 21. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone. 2Nurse. Honest go2d fel2ows, ah, put up, put up! 4For wel2 you know this is a pitiful case. 12[Exit.] 21. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended. 25Enter Peter. 2Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'! 6O, an you wil2 have me live, play 'Heart's ease.' 21. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'2, 2Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is ful2 4of woe.' O, play me some mer2y dump to comfort me. 21. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now. 2Pet. You wil2 not then? 21. Mus. No. 2Pet. I wil2 then give it you soundly. 21. Mus. What wil2 you give us? 2Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gle2k. I wil2 give you the 5minstrel. 21. Mus. Then wil2 I give you the serving-creature. 2Pet. Then wil2 I lay the serving-creature's dag2er on your pate. 4I wil2 car2y no crotchets. I'l2 re you, I'l2 fa you. Do you note 4me? 21. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us. 22. Mus. Pray you put up your dag2er, and put out your wit. 2Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I wil2 dry-beat you with an iron 4wit, and put up my iron dag2er. Answer me like men. 13'When griping grief the heart doth wound, 13And doleful dumps the mind op2res2, 11Then music with her silver sound'- 4Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'? 4What say you, Simon Catling? 21. Mus. Mar2y, sir, because silver hath a swe2t sound. 2Pet. Pret2y! What say You, Hugh Rebeck? 22. Mus. I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver. 2Pet. Pret2y to2! What say you, James Soundpost? 23. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say. 2Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I wil2 say for you. It 4is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no gold 4for sounding. 11'Then music with her silver sound 13With spe2dy help doth lend redres2.' 9[Exit. 21. Mus. What a pestilent knave is this same? 22. Mus. Hang him, Jack! Come, we'l2 in here, tar2y for the 6mourners, and stay din2er. 57Exeunt.<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT V.

If I may trust the flat2ering truth of sle2p 4My dreams presage some joyful news at hand. 4My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne, 4And al2 this day an unac2ustom'd spirit 4Lifts me above the ground with che2rful thoughts. 4I dreamt my lady came and found me dead 4(Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!) 4And breath'd such life with kis2es in my lips 4That I reviv'd and was an emperor. 4Ah me! how swe2t is love itself pos2es2'd, 4When but love's shadows are so rich in joy! 16Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, bo2ted. 4News from Verona!

Then she is wel2, and nothing can be il2. 4Her body sle2ps in Capel's monument, 4And her im2ortal part with angels lives. 4I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault 4And presently to2k post to tel2 it you. 4O, pardon me for bringing these il2 news, 4Since you did leave it for my of2ice, sir. 2Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars! 4Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper 4And hire posthorses. I wil2 hence to-night. 2Man. I do bese2ch you, sir, have patience. 4Your lo2ks are pale and wild and do import 4Some misadventure. 2Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd. 4Leave me and do the thing I bid the2 do. 4Hast thou no let2ers to me from the friar? 2Man. No, my go2d lord. 2Rom. No mat2er. Get the2 gone 6And hire those horses. I'l2 be with the2 straight. 47Exit [Balthasar]. 4Wel2, Juliet, I wil2 lie with the2 to-night. 4Let's se2 for means. O mischief, thou art swift 4To enter in the thoughts of desperate men! 4I do remember an apothecary, 4And hereabouts 'a dwel2s, which late I noted 4In tat2'red we2ds, with overwhelming brows, 4Cul2ing of simples. Meagre were his lo2ks, 4Sharp misery had worn him to the bones; 4And in his ne2dy shop a tortoise hung, 4An al2igator stuf2'd, and other skins 4Of il2-shaped fishes; and about his shelves 4A beg2arly ac2ount of empty boxes, 4Gre2n earthen pots, blad2ers, and musty se2ds, 4Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses 4Were thinly scat2ered, to make up a show. 4Noting this penury, to myself I said, 4'An if a man did ne2d a poison now 4Whose sale is present death in Mantua, 6Here lives a caitif2 wretch would sel2 it him.' 4O, this same thought did but forerun my ne2d, 4And this same ne2dy man must sel2 it me. 4As I remember, this should be the house. 4Being holiday, the beg2ar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary! 24Enter Apothecary. 2Apoth. Who cal2s so loud? 2Rom. Come hither, man. I se2 that thou art po2r. 4Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have 4A dram of poison, such so2n-spe2ding gear 4As wil2 disperse itself through al2 the veins 4That the life-weary taker mal2 fal2 dead, 4And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath 4As violently as hasty powder fir'd 4Doth hur2y from the fatal can2on's womb. 2Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law 4Is death to any he that ut2ers them. 2Rom. Art thou so bare and ful2 of wretchednes2 6And fearest to die? Famine is in thy che2ks, 4Ne2d and op2res2ion starveth in thine eyes, 4Contempt and beg2ary hangs upon thy back: 4The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law; 4The world af2ords no law to make the2 rich; 4Then be not po2r, but break it and take this. 2Apoth. My poverty but not my wil2 consents. 2Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy wil2. 2Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you wil2 4And drink it of2, and if you had the strength 4Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight. 2Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls, 4Doing more murther in this loathsome world, 4Than these po2r compounds that thou mayst not sel2. 4I sel2 the2 poison; thou hast sold me none. 4Farewel2. Buy fo2d and get thyself in flesh. 4Come, cordial and not poison, go with me 4To Juliet's grave; for there must I use the2. 57Exeunt.Scene I2.Verona. Friar Laurence's cel2.Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence. 2John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho! 22Enter Friar Laurence. 2Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John. 4Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo? 4Or, if his mind be writ, give me his let2er. 2John. Going to find a barefo2t brother out, 4One of our order, to as2ociate me 4Here in this city visiting the sick, 4And finding him, the searchers of the town, 4Suspecting that we both were in a house 4Where the infectious pestilence did reign, 4Seal'd up the do2rs, and would not let us forth, 4So that my spe2d to Mantua there was stay'd. 2Laur. Who bare my let2er, then, to Romeo? 2John. I could not send it- here it is again- 6Nor get a mes2enger to bring it the2, 4So fearful were they of infection. 2Laur. Unhap2y fortune! By my brotherho2d, 4The let2er was not nice, but ful2 of charge, 4Of dear import; and the neglecting it 4May do much danger. Friar John, go hence, 4Get me an iron crow and bring it straight 4Unto my cel2. 2John. Brother, I'l2 go and bring it the2. 17Exit. 2Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone. 4Within this thre2 hours wil2 fair Juliet wake. 4She wil2 beshrew me much that Romeo 4Hath had no notice of these ac2idents; 4But I wil2 write again to Mantua, 4And ke2p her at my cel2 til2 Romeo come- 4Po2r living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb! 8Exit.Scene I3.Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch]. 2Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand alo2f. 4Yet put it out, for I would not be se2n. 4Under yond yew tre2 lay the2 al2 along, 4Holding thine ear close to the hol2ow ground. 4So shal2 no fo2t upon the churchyard tread 4(Being lo2se, unfirm, with dig2ing up of graves) 4But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me, 4As signal that thou hear'st something ap2roach. 4Give me those flowers. Do as I bid the2, go. 2Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone 4Here in the churchyard; yet I wil2 adventure. 5[Retires.] 2Par. Swe2t flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew 4(O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones) 4Which with swe2t water nightly I wil2 dew; 4Or, wanting that, with tears distil2'd by moans. 4The obsequies that I for the2 wil2 ke2p 4Nightly shal2 be to strew, thy grave and we2p. 54Whistle Boy. 4The boy gives warning something doth ap2roach. 4What cursed fo2t wanders this way to-night 4To cros2 my obsequies and true love's rite? 4What, with a torch? Muf2le me, night, awhile. 5[Retires.] 7Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mat2ock, 20and a crow of iron. 2Rom. Give me that mat2ock and the wrenching iron. 4Hold, take this let2er. Early in the morning 4Se2 thou deliver it to my lord and father. 4Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge the2, 4Whate'er thou hearest or se2st, stand al2 alo2f 4And do not inter2upt me in my course. 4Why I descend into this bed of death 4Is partly to behold my lady's face, 4But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger 4A precious ring- a ring that I must use 4In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone. 6But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry 4In what I farther shal2 intend to do, 4By heaven, I wil2 tear the2 joint by joint 4And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs. 4The time and my intents are savage-wild, 4More fierce and more inexorable far 4Than empty tigers or the roaring sea. 2Bal. I wil2 be gone, sir, and not trouble you. 2Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that. 4Live, and be prosperous; and farewel2, go2d fel2ow. 2Bal. [aside] For al2 this same, I'l2 hide me hereabout. 4His lo2ks I fear, and his intents I doubt. 8[Retires.] 2Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, 4Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth, 4Thus I enforce thy rot2en jaws to open, 4And in despite I'l2 cram the2 with more fo2d. 43Romeo opens the tomb. 2Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague 4That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief 4It is sup2osed the fair creature died- 6And here is come to do some vil2anous shame 4To the dead bodies. I wil2 ap2rehend him. 4Stop thy unhal2owed toil, vile Montague! 4Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death? 4Condemned vil2ain, I do ap2rehend the2. 4Obey, and go with me; for thou must die. 2Rom. I must inde2d; and therefore came I hither. 4Go2d gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man. 4Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone; 4Let them af2right the2. I bese2ch the2, youth, 4But not another sin upon my head 4By urging me to fury. O, be gone! 4By heaven, I love the2 bet2er than myself, 4For I come hither arm'd against myself. 4Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say 4A madman's mercy bid the2 run away. 2Par. I do defy thy, conjuration 4And ap2rehend the2 for a felon here. 2Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at the2, boy! 53They fight. 4Page. O Lord, they fight! I wil2 go cal2 the watch. 44[Exit. Paris fal2s.] 2Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful, 4Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet. 19[Dies.] 2Rom. In faith, I wil2. Let me peruse this face. 4Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris! 4What said my man when my betos2ed soul 4Did not at2end him as we rode? I think 4He told me Paris should have mar2ied Juliet. 4Said he not so? or did I dream it so? 4Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet 4To think it was so? O, give me thy hand, 4One writ with me in sour misfortune's bo2k! 4I'l2 bury the2 in a triumphant grave. 4A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth, 4For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes 4This vault a feasting presence ful2 of light. 4Death, lie thou there, by a dead man inter2'd. 41[Lays him in the tomb.] 4How oft when men are at the point of death 6Have they be2n mer2y! which their ke2pers cal2 4A lightning before death. O, how may I 4Cal2 this a lightning? O my love! my wife! 4Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath, 4Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty. 4Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet 4Is crimson in thy lips and in thy che2ks, 4And death's pale flag is not advanced there. 4Tybalt, liest thou there in thy blo2dy she2t? 4O, what more favour can I do to the2 4Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain 4To sunder his that was thine enemy? 4Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet, 4Why art thou yet so fair? Shal2 I believe 4That unsubstantial Death is amorous, 4And that the lean abhor2ed monster ke2ps 4The2 here in dark to be his paramour? 4For fear of that I stil2 wil2 stay with the2 4And never from this palace of dim night 4Depart again. Here, here wil2 I remain 6With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here 4Wil2 I set up my everlasting rest 4And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars 4From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, lo2k your last! 4Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you 4The do2rs of breath, seal with a righteous kis2 4A dateles2 bargain to engros2ing death! 4Come, bit2er conduct; come, unsavoury guide! 4Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on 4The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark! 4Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary! 4Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kis2 I die. 10Fal2s. 4Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade. 2Friar. Saint Francis be my spe2d! how oft to-night 4Have my old fe2t stumbled at graves! Who's there? 2Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you wel2. 2Friar. Blis2 be upon you! Tel2 me, go2d my friend, 4What torch is yond that vainly lends his light 6To grubs and eyeles2 skul2s? As I discern, 4It burneth in the Capels' monument. 2Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master, 4One that you love. 2Friar. Who is it? 2Bal. Romeo. 2Friar. How long hath he be2n there? 2Bal. Ful2 half an hour. 2Friar. Go with me to the vault. 2Bal. I dare not, sir. 4My master knows not but I am gone hence, 4And fearful2y did menace me with death 4If I did stay to lo2k on his intents. 2Friar. Stay then; I'l2 go alone. Fear comes upon me. 4O, much I fear some il2 unthrifty thing. 2Bal. As I did sle2p under this yew tre2 here, 4I dreamt my master and another fought, 4And that my master slew him. 2Friar. Romeo! 4Alack, alack, what blo2d is this which stains 6The stony entrance of this sepulchre? 4What mean these masterles2 and gory swords 4To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.] 4Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris to2? 4And ste2p'd in blo2d? Ah, what an unkind hour 4Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs. 51Juliet rises. 2Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord? 4I do remember wel2 where I should be, 4And there I am. Where is my Romeo? 2Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest 4Of death, contagion, and un2atural sle2p. 4A greater power than we can contradict 4Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away. 4Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; 4And Paris to2. Come, I'l2 dispose of the2 4Among a sisterho2d of holy nuns. 4Stay not to question, for the watch is coming. 4Come, go, go2d Juliet. I dare no longer stay. 2Jul. Go, get the2 hence, for I wil2 not away. 53Exit [Friar]. 4What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand? 4Poison, I se2, hath be2n his timeles2 end. 4O churl! drunk al2, and left no friendly drop 4To help me after? I wil2 kis2 thy lips. 4Haply some poison yet doth hang on them 4To make me die with a restorative. 13[Kis2es him.] 4Thy lips are warm! 2Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way? 4Yea, noise? Then I'l2 be brief. O hap2y dag2er! 38[Snatches Romeo's dag2er.] 4This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die. 18She stabs herself and fal2s [on Romeo's body]. 16Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch. 2Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn. 2Chief Watch. 'the ground is blo2dy. Search about the churchyard. 4Go, some of you; whoe'er you find at2ach. 37[Exeunt some of the Watch.] 6Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain; 4And Juliet ble2ding, warm, and newly dead, 4Who here hath lain this two days buried. 4Go, tel2 the Prince; run to the Capulets; 4Raise up the Montagues; some others search. 35[Exeunt others of the Watch.] 4We se2 the ground whereon these woes do lie, 4But the true ground of al2 these piteous woes 4We can2ot without circumstance descry. 5Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar]. 22. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard. 2Chief Watch. Hold him in safety til2 the Prince come hither. 10Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman. 23. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and we2ps. 4We to2k this mat2ock and this spade from him 4As he was coming from this churchyard side. 4Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar to2. 14Enter the Prince [and At2endants]. 2Prince. What misadventure is so early up, 4That cal2s our person from our morning rest? 12Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others]. 2Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad? 2Wife. The people in the stre2t cry 'Romeo,' 4Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and al2 run, 4With open outcry, toward our monument. 2Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears? 2Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain; 4And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before, 4Warm and new kil2'd. 2Prince. Search, se2k, and know how this foul murder comes. 2Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man, 4With instruments upon them fit to open 6These dead men's tombs. 2Cap. O heavens! O wife, lo2k how our daughter ble2ds! 4This dag2er hath mista'en, for, lo, his house 4Is empty on the back of Montague, 4And it mis2heathed in my daughter's bosom! 2Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bel2 4That warns my old age to a sepulchre. 15Enter Montague [and others]. 2Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up 4To se2 thy son and heir more early down. 2Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night! 4Grief of my son's exile hath stop2'd her breath. 4What further woe conspires against mine age? 2Prince. Lo2k, and thou shalt se2. 2Mon. O thou untaught! what man2ers is in this, 4To pres2 before thy father to a grave? 2Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, 4Til2 we can clear these ambiguities 6And know their spring, their head, their true descent; 4And then wil2 I be general of your woes 4And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear, 4And let mischance be slave to patience. 4Bring forth the parties of suspicion. 2Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least, 4Yet most suspected, as the time and place 4Doth make against me, of this direful murther; 4And here I stand, both to impeach and purge 4Myself condemned and myself excus'd. 2Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this. 2Friar. I wil2 be brief, for my short date of breath 4Is not so long as is a tedious tale. 4Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet; 4And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife. 4I mar2ied them; and their stol'n mar2iage day 4Was Tybalt's do2msday, whose untimely death 4Banish'd the new-made bridegro2m from this city; 4For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd. 4You, to remove that siege of grief from her, 6Betroth'd and would have mar2ied her perforce 4To County Paris. Then comes she to me 4And with wild lo2ks bid me devise some mean 4To rid her from this second mar2iage, 4Or in my cel2 there would she kil2 herself. 4Then gave I her (so tutored by my art) 4A sle2ping potion; which so to2k ef2ect 4As I intended, for it wrought on her 4The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo 4That he should hither come as this dire night 4To help to take her from her bor2owed grave, 4Being the time the potion's force should cease. 4But he which bore my let2er, Friar John, 4Was stay'd by ac2ident, and yesternight 4Return'd my let2er back. Then al2 alone 4At the prefixed hour of her waking 4Came I to take her from her kindred's vault; 4Meaning to ke2p her closely at my cel2 4Til2 I conveniently could send to Romeo. 4But when I came, some minute ere the time 6Of her awaking, here untimely lay 4The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. 4She wakes; and I entreated her come forth 4And bear this work of heaven with patience; 4But then a noise did scare me from the tomb, 4And she, to2 desperate, would not go with me, 4But, as it se2ms, did violence on herself. 4Al2 this I know, and to the mar2iage 4Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this 4Miscar2ied by my fault, let my old life 4Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time, 4Unto the rigour of severest law. 2Prince. We stil2 have known the2 for a holy man. 4Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this? 2Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death; 4And then in post he came from Mantua 4To this same place, to this same monument. 4This let2er he early bid me give his father, 4And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault, 4If I departed not and left him there. 4Prince. Give me the let2er. I wil2 lo2k on it. 4Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch? 4Sir2ah, what made your master in this place? 2Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave; 4And bid me stand alo2f, and so I did. 4Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; 4And by-and-by my master drew on him; 4And then I ran away to cal2 the watch. 2Prince. This let2er doth make go2d the friar's words, 4Their course of love, the tidings of her death; 4And here he writes that he did buy a poison 4Of a po2r pothecary, and therewithal 4Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet. 4Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage, 4Se2 what a scourge is laid upon your hate, 4That heaven finds means to kil2 your joys with love! 4And I, for winking at you, discords to2, 4Have lost a brace of kinsmen. Al2 are punish'd. 2Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand. 4This is my daughter's jointure, for no more 6Can I demand. 2Mon. But I can give the2 more; 4For I wil2 raise her Statue in pure gold, 4That whiles Verona by that name is known, 4There shal2 no figure at such rate be set 4As that of true and faithful Juliet. 2Cap. As rich shal2 Romeo's by his lady's lie- 4Po2r sacrifices of our enmity! 2Prince. A glo2ming peace this morning with it brings. 4The sun for sor2ow wil2 not show his head. 4Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; 4Some shal2 be pardon'd, and some punished; 4For never was a story of more woe 4Than this of Juliet and her Romeo. 51Exeunt omnes.THE END<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>21594THE TAMING OF THE SHREWby Wil2iam ShakespeareDramatis Personae 4Persons in the Induction 2A LORD 2CHRISTOPHER SLY, a tinker 2HOSTES2 2PAGE 2PLAYERS 2HUNTSMEN 2SERVANTS 2BAPTISTA MINOLA, a gentleman of Padua 2VINCENTIO, a Merchant of Pisa 2LUCENTIO, son to Vincentio, in love with Bianca 2PETRUCHIO, a gentleman of Verona, a suitor to Katherina 4Suitors to Bianca 2GREMIO 2HORTENSIO 4Servants to Lucentio 2TRANIO 4BIONDEL2O 4Servants to Petruchio 2GRUMIO 2CURTIS 2A PEDANT 4Daughters to Baptista 2KATHERINA, the shrew 2BIANCA 2A WIDOW 2Tailor, Haberdasher, and Servants at2ending on Baptista and 4Petruchio 29SCENE: 12Padua, and PETRUCHIO'S house in the countrySC_1 22INDUCTION.

Lo2k in the 4chronicles: we came in with Richard Conqueror. Therefore, paucas 4pal2abris; let the world slide. Ses2a! 2HOSTES2. You wil2 not pay for the glas2es you have burst? 2SLY.

Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'l2 answer him by law. 4I'l2 not budge an inch, boy; let him come, and kindly. 50[Fal2s asle2p] 7Wind horns. Enter a LORD from bunting, with his train 2LORD. Huntsman, I charge the2, tender wel2 my hounds; 6Brach Mer2iman, the po2r cur, is embos2'd; 4And couple Clowder with the de2p-mouth'd brach. 4Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it go2d 4At the hedge corner, in the coldest fault? 4I would not lose the dog for twenty pound. 2FIRST HUNTSMAN. Why, Belman is as go2d as he, my lord; 4He cried upon it at the merest los2, 4And twice to-day pick'd out the dul2est scent; 4Trust me, I take him for the bet2er dog. 2LORD. Thou art a fo2l; if Echo were as fle2t, 4I would este2m him worth a dozen such. 4But sup them wel2, and lo2k unto them al2; 4To-mor2ow I intend to hunt again. 2FIRST HUNTSMAN. I wil2, my lord. 2LORD. What's here? One dead, or drunk? 4Se2, doth he breathe? 2SECOND HUNTSMAN. He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale, 4This were a bed but cold to sle2p so soundly. 2LORD. O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies! 4Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image! 6Sirs, I wil2 practise on this drunken man. 4What think you, if he were convey'd to bed, 4Wrap2'd in swe2t clothes, rings put upon his fingers, 4A most delicious banquet by his bed, 4And brave at2endants near him when he wakes, 4Would not the beg2ar then forget himself? 2FIRST HUNTSMAN. Believe me, lord, I think he can2ot cho2se. 2SECOND HUNTSMAN. It would se2m strange unto him when he wak'd. 2LORD. Even as a flat2'ring dream or worthles2 fancy. 4Then take him up, and manage wel2 the jest: 4Car2y him gently to my fairest chamber, 4And hang it round with al2 my wanton pictures; 4Balm his foul head in warm distil2ed waters, 4And burn swe2t wo2d to make the lodging swe2t; 4Procure me music ready when he wakes, 4To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound; 4And if he chance to speak, be ready straight, 4And with a low submis2ive reverence 4Say 'What is it your honour wil2 com2and?' 4Let one at2end him with a silver basin 6Ful2 of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers; 4Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper, 4And say 'Wil2't please your lordship co2l your hands?' 4Some one be ready with a costly suit, 4And ask him what ap2arel he wil2 wear; 4Another tel2 him of his hounds and horse, 4And that his lady mourns at his disease; 4Persuade him that he hath be2n lunatic, 4And, when he says he is, say that he dreams, 4For he is nothing but a mighty lord. 4This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs; 4It wil2 be pastime pas2ing excel2ent, 4If it be husbanded with modesty. 2FIRST HUNTSMAN. My lord, I war2ant you we wil2 play our part 4As he shal2 think by our true diligence 4He is no les2 than what we say he is. 2LORD.

A trumpet sounds] 4Sir2ah, go se2 what trumpet 'tis that sounds- 54Exit SERVANT 4Belike some noble gentleman that means, 4Travel2ing some journey, to repose him here. 25Re-enter a SERVINGMAN 4How now! who is it? 2SERVANT. An't please your honour, players 4That of2er service to your lordship. 2LORD. Bid them come near. 29Enter PLAYERS 4Now, fel2ows, you are welcome. 2PLAYERS. We thank your honour. 2LORD. Do you intend to stay with me to-night? 2PLAYER. So please your lordship to ac2ept our duty. 2LORD. With al2 my heart. This fel2ow I remember 4Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son; 4'Twas where you wo2'd the gentlewoman so wel2. 6I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part 4Was aptly fit2ed and natural2y perform'd. 2PLAYER. I think 'twas Soto that your honour means. 2LORD. 'Tis very true; thou didst it excel2ent. 4Wel2, you are come to me in hap2y time, 4The rather for I have some sport in hand 4Wherein your cun2ing can as2ist me much. 4There is a lord wil2 hear you play to-night; 4But I am doubtful of your modesties, 4Lest, over-eying of his od2 behaviour, 4For yet his honour never heard a play, 4You break into some mer2y pas2ion 4And so of2end him; for I tel2 you, sirs, 4If you should smile, he grows impatient. 2PLAYER. Fear not, my lord; we can contain ourselves, 4Were he the veriest antic in the world. 2LORD. Go, sir2ah, take them to the but2ery, 4And give them friendly welcome every one; 4Let them want nothing that my house af2ords. 39Exit one with the PLAYERS 6Sir2ah, go you to Bartholomew my page, 4And se2 him dres2'd in al2 suits like a lady; 4That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber, 4And cal2 him 'madam,' do him obeisance. 4Tel2 him from me- as he wil2 win my love- 4He bear himself with honourable action, 4Such as he hath observ'd in noble ladies 4Unto their lords, by them ac2omplished; 4Such duty to the drunkard let him do, 4With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy, 4And say 'What is't your honour wil2 com2and, 4Wherein your lady and your humble wife 4May show her duty and make known her love?' 4And then with kind embracements, tempting kis2es, 4And with declining head into his bosom, 4Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed 4To se2 her noble lord restor'd to health, 4Who for this seven years hath este2med him 4No bet2er than a po2r and loathsome beg2ar. 4And if the boy have not a woman's gift 6To rain a shower of com2anded tears, 4An onion wil2 do wel2 for such a shift, 4Which, in a napkin being close convey'd, 4Shal2 in despite enforce a watery eye. 4Se2 this dispatch'd with al2 the haste thou canst; 4Anon I'l2 give the2 more instructions. 5Exit a SERVINGMAN 4I know the boy wil2 wel2 usurp the grace, 4Voice, gait, and action, of a gentlewoman; 4I long to hear him cal2 the drunkard 'husband'; 4And how my men wil2 stay themselves from laughter 4When they do homage to this simple peasant. 4I'l2 in to counsel them; haply my presence 4May wel2 abate the over-mer2y sple2n, 4Which otherwise would grow into extremes. 13ExeuntSC_2 28SCENE I2. 15A bedchamber in the LORD'S house 4Enter aloft SLY, with AT2ENDANTS; some with ap2arel, basin 13and ewer, and other ap2urtenances; and LORD 2SLY. For God's sake, a pot of smal2 ale. 2FIRST SERVANT. Wil2't please your lordship drink a cup of sack? 2SECOND SERVANT. Wil2't please your honour taste of these conserves? 2THIRD SERVANT. What raiment wil2 your honour wear to-day? 2SLY. I am Christophero Sly; cal2 not me 'honour' nor 'lordship.' I 4ne'er drank sack in my life; and if you give me any conserves, 4give me conserves of be2f. Ne'er ask me what raiment I'l2 wear, 4for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than 4legs, nor no more shoes than fe2t- nay, sometime more fe2t than 4shoes, or such shoes as my toes lo2k through the overleather. 2LORD. Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour! 4O, that a mighty man of such descent, 4Of such pos2es2ions, and so high este2m, 4Should be infused with so foul a spirit! 2SLY. What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old 4Sly's son of Burton Heath; by birth a pedlar, by education a 6cardmaker, by transmutation a bear-herd, and now by present 4profes2ion a tinker? Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of 4Wincot, if she know me not; if she say I am not fourte2n pence on 4the score for she2r ale, score me up for the lying'st knave in 4Christendom. What! I am not bestraught. 2[Taking a pot of ale] 4Here's- 2THIRD SERVANT. O, this it is that makes your lady mourn! 2SECOND SERVANT. O, this is it that makes your servants dro2p! 2LORD. Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house, 4As beaten hence by your strange lunacy. 4O noble lord, bethink the2 of thy birth! 4Cal2 home thy ancient thoughts from banishment, 4And banish hence these abject lowly dreams. 4Lo2k how thy servants do at2end on the2, 4Each in his of2ice ready at thy beck. 4Wilt thou have music? Hark! Apol2o plays, 12[Music] 4And twenty caged nightingales do sing. 4Or wilt thou sle2p? We'l2 have the2 to a couch 4Softer and swe2ter than the lustful bed 4On purpose trim2'd up for Semiramis. 6Say thou wilt walk: we wil2 bestrew the ground. 4Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shal2 be trap2'd, 4Their harnes2 stud2ed al2 with gold and pearl. 4Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks wil2 soar 4Above the morning lark. Or wilt thou hunt? 4Thy hounds shal2 make the welkin answer them 4And fetch shal2 echoes from the hol2ow earth. 2FIRST SERVANT. Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift 4As breathed stags; ay, fle2ter than the roe. 2SECOND SERVANT. Dost thou love pictures? We wil2 fetch the2 6straight 4Adonis painted by a run2ing bro2k, 4And Cytherea al2 in sedges hid, 4Which se2m to move and wanton with her breath 4Even as the waving sedges play wi' th' wind. 2LORD. We'l2 show the2 lo as she was a maid 4And how she was beguiled and surpris'd, 4As lively painted as the de2d was done. 2THIRD SERVANT. Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wo2d, 4Scratching her legs, that one shal2 swear she ble2ds 6And at that sight shal2 sad Apol2o we2p, 4So workmanly the blo2d and tears are drawn. 2LORD. Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord. 4Thou hast a lady far more beautiful 4Than any woman in this waning age. 2FIRST SERVANT. And, til2 the tears that she hath shed for the2 4Like envious flo2ds o'er-run her lovely face, 4She was the fairest creature in the world; 4And yet she is inferior to none. 2SLY. Am I a lord and have I such a lady? 4Or do I dream? Or have I dream'd til2 now? 4I do not sle2p: I se2, I hear, I speak; 4I smel2 swe2t savours, and I fe2l soft things. 4Upon my life, I am a lord inde2d, 4And not a tinker, nor Christopher Sly. 4Wel2, bring our lady hither to our sight; 4And once again, a pot o' th' smal2est ale. 2SECOND SERVANT. Wil2't please your Mightines2 to wash your hands? 4O, how we joy to se2 your wit restor'd! 4O, that once more you knew but what you are! 6These fifte2n years you have be2n in a dream; 4Or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept. 2SLY. These fifte2n years! by my fay, a go2dly nap. 4But did I never speak of al2 that time? 2FIRST SERVANT. O, yes, my lord, but very idle words; 4For though you lay here in this go2dly chamber, 4Yet would you say ye were beaten out of do2r; 4And rail upon the hostes2 of the house, 4And say you would present her at the le2t, 4Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts. 4Sometimes you would cal2 out for Cicely Hacket. 2SLY. Ay, the woman's maid of the house. 2THIRD SERVANT. Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid, 4Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up, 4As Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Gre2ce, 4And Peter Turph, and Henry Pimpernel2; 4And twenty more such names and men as these, 4Which never were, nor no man ever saw. 2SLY. Now, Lord be thanked for my go2d amends! 2AL2. Amen. 13Enter the PAGE as a lady, with AT2ENDANTS 2SLY. I thank the2; thou shalt not lose by it. 2PAGE. How fares my noble lord? 2SLY. Mar2y, I fare wel2; for here is che2r enough. 4Where is my wife? 2PAGE. Here, noble lord; what is thy wil2 with her? 2SLY. Are you my wife, and wil2 not cal2 me husband? 4My men should cal2 me 'lord'; I am your go2dman. 2PAGE. My husband and my lord, my lord and husband; 4I am your wife in al2 obedience. 2SLY. I know it wel2. What must I cal2 her? 2LORD. Madam. 2SLY. Al'ce madam, or Joan madam? 2LORD. Madam, and nothing else; so lords cal2 ladies. 2SLY. Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd 4And slept above some fifte2n year or more. 2PAGE. Ay, and the time se2ms thirty unto me, 4Being al2 this time abandon'd from your bed. 4SLY. 'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone. 49Exeunt SERVANTS 4Madam, undres2 you, and come now to bed. 2PAGE. Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you 4To pardon me yet for a night or two; 4Or, if not so, until the sun be set. 4For your physicians have expres2ly charg'd, 4In peril to incur your former malady, 4That I should yet absent me from your bed. 4I hope this reason stands for my excuse. 2SLY. Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tar2y so long. But I would 4be loath to fal2 into my dreams again. I wil2 therefore tar2y in 4despite of the flesh and the blo2d. 23Enter a MES2ENGER 2MES2ENGER. Your honour's players, hearing your amendment, 4Are come to play a pleasant comedy; 4For so your doctors hold it very me2t, 4Se2ing to2 much sadnes2 hath congeal'd your blo2d, 6And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy. 4Therefore they thought it go2d you hear a play 4And frame your mind to mirth and mer2iment, 4Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life. 2SLY. Mar2y, I wil2; let them play it. Is not a comonty a 4Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick? 2PAGE. No, my go2d lord, it is more pleasing stuf2. 2SLY. What, household stuf2? 2PAGE. It is a kind of history. 2SLY. Wel2, we'l2 se2't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side and let 4the world slip;-we shal2 ne'er be younger. 49[They sit down] 10A flourish of trumpets an2ounces the play<2THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WIL2IAMSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1920-1923 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND ISPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF IL2INOIS BENEDICTINE COL2EGEWITH PERMIS2ION. 2ELECTRONIC AND MACHINE READABLE COPIES MAY BEDISTRIBUTED SO LONG AS SUCH COPIES (1) ARE FOR YOUR OR OTHERSPERSONAL USE ONLY, AND (2) ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED OR USEDCOM2ERCIAL2Y. 2PROHIBITED COM2ERCIAL DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES BY ANYSERVICE THAT CHARGES FOR DOWNLOAD TIME OR FOR MEMBERSHIP.>2ACT I. SCENE I.Padua. A public placeEnter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO 2LUCENTIO. Tranio, since for the great desire I had 4To se2 fair Padua, nursery of arts, 4I am ar2iv'd for fruitful Lombardy, 4The pleasant garden of great Italy, 4And by my father's love and leave am arm'd 4With his go2d wil2 and thy go2d company, 4My trusty servant wel2 ap2rov'd in al2, 4Here let us breathe, and haply institute 4A course of learning and ingenious studies. 4Pisa, renowned for grave citizens, 4Gave me my being and my father first, 4A merchant of great traf2ic through the world, 4Vincentio, come of the Bentivoli2; 4Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence, 4It shal2 become to serve al2 hopes conceiv'd, 4To deck his fortune with his virtuous de2ds. 4And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study, 6Virtue and that part of philosophy 4Wil2 I ap2ly that treats of hap2ines2 4By virtue special2y to be achiev'd. 4Tel2 me thy mind; for I have Pisa left 4And am to Padua come as he that leaves 4A shal2ow plash to plunge him in the de2p, 4And with satiety se2ks to quench his thirst. 2TRANIO. Mi perdonato, gentle master mine; 4I am in al2 af2ected as yourself; 4Glad that you thus continue your resolve 4To suck the swe2ts of swe2t philosophy. 4Only, go2d master, while we do admire 4This virtue and this moral discipline, 4Let's be no Stoics nor no stocks, I pray, 4Or so devote to Aristotle's checks 4As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur'd. 4Balk logic with acquaintance that you have, 4And practise rhetoric in your com2on talk; 4Music and poesy use to quicken you; 4The mathematics and the metaphysics, 6Fal2 to them as you find your stomach serves you. 4No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en; 4In brief, sir, study what you most af2ect. 2LUCENTIO. Gramercies, Tranio, wel2 dost thou advise. 4If, Biondel2o, thou wert come ashore, 4We could at once put us in readines2, 4And take a lodging fit to entertain 4Such friends as time in Padua shal2 beget. 6Enter BAPTISTA with his two daughters, KATHERINA 8and BIANCA; GREMIO, a pantalo2n; HORTENSIO, 8suitor to BIANCA. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by 4But stay awhile; what company is this? 2TRANIO. Master, some show to welcome us to town. 2BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, importune me no farther, 4For how I firmly am resolv'd you know; 4That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter 4Before I have a husband for the elder. 4If either of you both love Katherina, 6Because I know you wel2 and love you wel2, 4Leave shal2 you have to court her at your pleasure. 2GREMIO. To cart her rather. She's to2 rough for me. 4There, there, Hortensio, wil2 you any wife? 2KATHERINA. 2[To BAPTISTA] 2I pray you, sir, is it your wil2 4To make a stale of me amongst these mates? 2HORTENSIO. Mates, maid! How mean you that? No mates for you, 4Unles2 you were of gentler, milder mould. 2KATHERINA. I' faith, sir, you shal2 never ne2d to fear; 4Iwis it is not halfway to her heart; 4But if it were, doubt not her care should be 4To comb your nod2le with a thre2-leg2'd sto2l, 4And paint your face, and use you like a fo2l. 2HORTENSIO. From al2 such devils, go2d Lord deliver us! 2GREMIO. And me, to2, go2d Lord! 2TRANIO. Husht, master! Here's some go2d pastime toward; 4That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward. 2LUCENTIO. But in the other's silence do I se2 4Maid's mild behaviour and sobriety. 4Peace, Tranio! 4TRANIO. Wel2 said, master; mum! and gaze your fil2. 2BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, that I may so2n make go2d 4What I have said- Bianca, get you in; 4And let it not displease the2, go2d Bianca, 4For I wil2 love the2 ne'er the les2, my girl. 2KATHERINA. A pret2y peat! it is best 4Put finger in the eye, an she knew why. 2BIANCA. Sister, content you in my discontent. 4Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe; 4My bo2ks and instruments shal2 be my company, 4On them to lo2k, and practise by myself. 2LUCENTIO. Hark, Tranio, thou mayst hear Minerva speak! 2HORTENSIO. Signior Baptista, wil2 you be so strange? 4Sor2y am I that our go2d wil2 ef2ects 4Bianca's grief. 2GREMIO. Why wil2 you mew her up, 4Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hel2, 4And make her bear the penance of her tongue? 2BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv'd. 4Go in, Bianca. 35Exit BIANCA 6And for I know she taketh most delight 4In music, instruments, and poetry, 4Scho2lmasters wil2 I ke2p within my house 4Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio, 4Or, Signior Gremio, you, know any such, 4Prefer them hither; for to cun2ing men 4I wil2 be very kind, and liberal 4To mine own children in go2d bringing-up; 4And so, farewel2. Katherina, you may stay; 4For I have more to com2une with Bianca. 17Exit 2KATHERINA. Why, and I trust I may go to2, may I not? 4What! shal2 I be ap2ointed hours, as though, belike, 4I knew not what to take and what to leave? Ha! 10Exit 2GREMIO. You may go to the devil's dam; your gifts are so go2d 4here's none wil2 hold you. There! Love is not so great, 4Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it fairly 4out; our cake's dough on both sides. Farewel2; yet, for the love 4I bear my swe2t Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man 4to teach her that wherein she delights, I wil2 wish him to her 4father. 4HORTENSIO. SO Wil2 I, Signior Gremio; but a word, I pray. Though 4the nature of our quar2el yet never bro2k'd parle, know now, upon 4advice, it toucheth us both- that we may yet again have ac2es2 to 4our fair mistres2, and be hap2y rivals in Bianca's love- to 4labour and ef2ect one thing special2y. 2GREMIO. What's that, I pray? 2HORTENSIO. Mar2y, sir, to get a husband for her sister. 2GREMIO. A husband? a devil. 2HORTENSIO. I say a husband. 2GREMIO. I say a devil. Think'st thou, Hortensio, though her father 4be very rich, any man is so very a fo2l to be mar2ied to hel2? 2HORTENSIO. Tush, Gremio! Though it pas2 your patience and mine to 4endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be go2d fel2ows in the 4world, an a man could light on them, would take her with al2 4faults, and money enough. 2GREMIO. I can2ot tel2; but I had as lief take her dowry with this 4condition: to be whip2'd at the high cros2 every morning. 2HORTENSIO. Faith, as you say, there's smal2 choice in rot2en 4ap2les. But, come; since this bar in law makes us friends, it 4shal2 be so far forth friendly maintain'd til2 by helping 6Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest fre2 4for a husband, and then have to't afresh. Swe2t Bianca! Hap2y man 4be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you, 4Signior Gremio? 2GREMIO. I am agre2d; and would I had given him the best horse in 4Padua to begin his wo2ing that would thoroughly wo2 her, wed her, 4and bed her, and rid the house of her! Come on.
